This \nglobal pandemic has had an impact on our \nwellbeing and livelihood and will be a focus \nin our lives well into the future. Many argue \nthat this focus will continue until a vaccine \nhas been produced. \nA truly global pandemic such as COVID-19 \nhas only really occurred once before in living \nhistory, in the form of the Spanish Influenza. \nWe can turn to the Humanities, and History \nin particular, to learn from the experience of \nthe Spanish Flu and try and make sense of \nCOVID-19.\nThese two global pandemics \u2013 while \nseparated by 100 years \u2013 share many \nsimilarities. Not only do both diseases \ncause respiratory failure but they have led to government intervention, such as the \ntemporary shutdown of our cities, and then \nlesser shutdowns of non-essential businesses \nand schools. Physical distancing measures \nimposed on populations around the world, \nand the halt of international and interstate \ntravel to stem the transmission of the disease \nhave also impacted businesses, communities \nand individuals around the world.\nThe long-term economic effects of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic are less clear \nthan the medical effects. Unprecedented \nsteps by governments to stop the spread \nof the virus have caused disruptions to \nlivelihoods through economic shutdown \nand unemployment. Global supply-chain \nissues contributed to panic buying in cities \nthroughout the world. The year 2020 will \nlikely become associated with key images, \nincluding of empty supermarket shelves due \nto the panic buying of toilet paper and many \nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",

Another key image will \nbe the wearing of face masks. Even one of \nthe whimsical statues seen on the corner of \nSwanston and Bourke Streets in Melbourne, \nknown as the \u2018Three Businessmen Carrying \nLunchboxes\u2019, is wearing a facemask (pictured \nat the start of this introduction). \nBut it is important to remember that \ntoday\u2019s world in 2020 is a far cry from 100 \nyears ago. Great advances have been made \nmedically, technologically and in terms of \nthe general standard of living. People living \nin 1918 were also dealing with the horrific \nramifications of World War I, which had just \nended. However, reflecting on our historical \nexperience is one way we can find optimism \nand hope for the recovery ahead. The global \nimpact of COVID-19 both on people\u2019s \nhealth and on their livelihoods means the \nworld must come together, like never before, \nto find a global solution. This virus spreads \nacross geographic borders, with drastic \nhuman and economic costs, and a common \nglobal effort to find a solution via a vaccine \nis more important now than ever.

  "Page 14": "1 \nHistory\nWhat is history?\nHistory is the study of the past. We study the past \nin order to better understand the present and to \nhelp us prepare more effectively for the future. \nHistory can give us a sense of where we have \ncome from. It can also give us a sense of where we \nare headed.\nThe concept of history is common to all people. \nIt exists in all societies. The simple act of keeping \nrecords about ourselves, our families and the \nnation in which we live makes all of us historians \nin one way or another.\nHistory opens a window on the past. It shows \nhow our own society has changed over time. It \nalso helps us understand how other nations and \nsocieties have changed over time.\nHistory is a process of investigation that follows \ncertain rules. It begins by posing a question or starting an investigation, then gathering evidence \nthat will answer that question.\nOne kind of evidence historians seek out is \nprimary sources . These are records that were \nmade by people who lived at the time being \ninvestigated. Written or printed documents are \nuseful primary sources. Photographs, drawings \nand paintings can also tell us a great deal if we \ncan interpret, or \u2018read\u2019, them carefully.\nAnother kind of evidence used by historians is \nsecondary sources . These are records made at a \ntime after the event being investigated. When \nusing secondary sources, historians look critically \nat the views of the people who created those \nsources. They ask extra questions about those \npeople\u2019s interpretations of what happened.\nWhen you think about it, history could be \nthought of as \u2018the thinking person\u2019s guide to \nthe\u00a0future\u2019.\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 15": "Introducing historical \nconcepts and skills: using historical sources as evidence\nIn this section, you will come across a variety of \nhistorical sources. You will be asked to examine these sources and to interpret what they show. You will be asked to consider who created these sources, and why. You will decide how reliable these sources are, often by comparing them with other sources. Historians are sometimes called \u2018time detectives\u2019 because, like detectives, they are constantly investigating and interrogating the stories that people tell. You will be asked to read historians\u2019 points of view, to make decisions about their interpretations, and to conclude how accurate their view is.\nAs historians, our most important form of \nevidence comes from primary sources. This is information written by people who were present at the time we are studying. They were there, witnessing what occurred, and they made some record of it at the time (or shortly after). These records are the lifeblood of history. They offer us a deep understanding of events and people\u2019s reactions to them.\nPrimary sources can take many forms: \nhandwritten documents, printed material, images (drawings, oil paintings, photographs), statues and artefacts (objects).\nSecondary sources are records that were written \nwell after the events being studied. They are often written by historians who may not have been there to witness events directly. That is why it is so important for historians to carefully read and analyse primary sources, to get an accurate picture of what actually happened. Historians do often have quite different points of view. Their historical opinions might be formed by their class, religious and political beliefs, age or gender.\nSecondary sources can take a number of forms, \nbut typically they include things like broad surveys of a period of history, more precise studies of specific events, and biographies (life stories) of famous people.\nThere is a very special relationship between \nprimary sources and secondary sources. Because primary sources were written by people who were alive at the time \u2013 people who experienced those events directly \u2013 it is tempting to think that they must be completely reliable eyewitness accounts. However, this overlooks the fact that every person has their own particular way of looking at things, based on their personal values and attitudes. These values and attitudes might lead a person to write an explanation of what happened that is more in line with their values and attitudes than what actually happened. This is called bias.\nThe task of a historian who is writing a secondary \nsource many years after the event is to look critically at a primary source. They need to carefully research who the creator of that primary source was and what their point of view might have been. For example, in times of war we might expect a general sitting comfortably in his headquarters to have one view of a battle, while an ordinary soldier fighting at the battlefront might have a very different view of the battle altogether.\n\u25c0 Image:  This poster from the time of \nW\norld War II, showing a sailor shaking hands \nwith two factory workers, is an instance of a \nprimary source for this historical event.\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 16": "Overview\nDuring the 1930s Australia followed the \nBritish policy of \u2018appeasing\u2019 Adolf Hitler. \nAppeasement can be defined as the process \nof \u2018giving in\u2019 to the demands of an aggressive \nruler in order to avoid the possibility of a \ndeclaration of war. The Allies did not like \nHitler\u2019s many demands, but they gave in to \nthem on the grounds that compromise was \nbetter than triggering another world war. \nLater, when war broke out despite \nappeasement, nearly one million Australians \nenlisted voluntarily to support Britain and its \nallies in their struggle against Germany. The \nmen and women who enlisted had in some \ncases already been involved in the Great War \nof 1914\u20131918. One hundred Australians, \nincluding thirty pilots, were present at the \nearly World War II conflict known as the \nBattle of Britain, the savage air battle that \nsaved Britain from invasion. One important \ndifference between World War I and World \nWar II was that World War II touched \nAustralia directly. The Japanese mini-\nsubmarine attack on Sydney Harbour, which \nkilled 19 sailors, showed how easily the war \ncould reach Australia. The devastating attack \non Darwin and other northern cities, which \nkilled 230 people and injured 300-400 more \nin Darwin alone, was so traumatic that for \ndecades its full extent was kept a secret. \nBy contrast, the Battle of Kokoda captured \nthe nation\u2019s imagination in the same way that \nGallipoli had. Each year hundreds of people \nwalk along the Kokoda Trail in tribute to the \nsoldiers who fought a desperate holding battle \nto turn back the superior Japanese invasion \nforce. There, some 600 Australians were killed \nand another 1600 were wounded. Australia\u2019s involvement in World War II \nredirected Australia\u2019s international alliances \naway from Britain towards the United States \nof America, which helped to increase the pace \nof its industrial development.\nLearning goals\nAfter completing this unit, you should be able \nto answer these questions:\n\u2022 How did the nature of global conflict \nchange during the twentieth century?\n\u2022 What were the consequences of \nWorld War II?\n\u2022 How did these consequences shape the \nmodern world?\nIntroducing historical  \nconcepts and skills: change \nand continuity\nThroughout this unit there will be a special \nfocus on the concepts of change  and \ncontinuity . Even in times of great change \n\u2013 such as the Industrial Revolution in \nBritain \u2013 some things remain unchanged and \ncontinue as they had before. For example, \nwhile the Industrial Revolution made massive \nchanges to the way industry and agriculture \nwere carried out, the government of Britain \nremained very much as it had been before, \nwith a king or queen ruling in conjunction \nwith a parliament.\nHistorians never limit themselves to merely \ndescribing what has happened in the past. \nInstead they ask themselves two questions.\nFirst, what kinds of change  have occurred \nin the period of time we are studying? Are \nthe changes mainly political  (to do with \nUnit 1 The modern world and Australia:  \nWorld War II\nVideo\nUnit overview\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 17": "government), economic (to do with the \nproduction of goods) or social (to do with the way people lived)? Are the changes a combination of two or three of these kinds of\u00a0change?\nSecond, can you quantify these changes \n(that\u00a0is, explain whether the changes were massive in scale, or relatively minor)? Did the changes generally benefit people, or did they cause difficulty and hardship? Did the changes affect the entire population, or only certain groups of people? What were the long-term and short-term consequences of those changes?\nThese two considerations can come together \nvery powerfully in the hands of the historian. Instead of making a general statement like, \u2018Australia was changed by the experiences of World War II\u2019, the historian can say that, in political terms, change was less dramatic than for other nations because the Commonwealth Government of Australia, created in 1901, remained in place throughout both wars. In economic terms, a historian can say that the Australian economy remained capitalist, but also that Australia learned how to increase its manufacturing capacity by creating its own ammunition instead of relying on Britain. In social terms, the historian can say that Australian society was changed very greatly by World War II, due to the fact that women gained the experience of entering the workforce and proved that they could do jobs that, traditionally, only men had done up until that time. \n\u25b2 Image:  German children playing on a tank in a bomb-damaged part of Berlin, c irca July 1945\nUnit 1 \nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",

At ground level, though, the past is permanent. All across the city, \nfitting snugly between cobblestone footpaths that were re-laid after Berlin was all but destroyed at \nthe conclusion of World War II in 1945, are small, brass plaques that remind us of the human cost \nof this conflict.\nThese plaques are known as stolpersteine  \n(\u2018stumbling stones\u2019). Each plaque contains the \nname of a resident who once lived at the stone\u2019s \nlocation, and who was forcibly evicted by the \nfascist regime that took hold of Germany between \n1933 and 1945. The stones include the victim\u2019s \ndate of birth and their final fate: imprisonment, \nexile, suicide, or, as is overwhelmingly the case, \nmurder. These people include Jewish people, \nRomani people, gay and lesbian people, people \nwith a disability, and those who politically \nopposed the fascist government of the National \nSocialist Party. They are a reminder that those \nwho fell victim to The Holocaust and the \nNational Socialist regime were ordinary people \nwho lived in ordinary streets in an otherwise \nordinary European city. \nThe stolpersteine  are the creation of German \nartist Gunter Demnig, who began making them \nin 1992. Each one is crafted by hand. There are \n70 000 stolpersteine instal led across 1200 towns \nacross Europe, but Demnig\u2019s work is ongoing \u2013 \nthe National Socialists killed approximately \n9 million people. In an event of such scale it is \neasy to understand how individual names can be \nlost and forgotten.\nCarefully examine the photo in Source 1.3. \nThese stolpersteine  represent the members of the \nLaubinger family, who were forcibly removed \nfrom their home in Leipzig by the German army \nand secret police. The parents, seven children \nand five grandchildren were all removed from \ntheir home in Leipzig between 1939 and 1943. An entire extended family was removed. On the \nfar right is Artur, who was 15 years old when he \nwas deported. He was murdered a year later in \nAuschwitz.\nArtur Laubinger would likely have been forced \ndown the road past his childhood home at \ngunpoint. He would have been shouted at by \nsoldiers and barked at by dogs while clutching the \nfew possessions he could carry. His neighbours \nand friends would have watched. He may have \nbeen forced to live in squalid conditions in a \nfaraway ghetto and eventually taken via train to \nthe Auschwitz concentration camp, the largest \ndeath camp in wartime Germany. He would have \nbeen separated from his family, stripped of his few \nbelongings and murdered in one of Auschwitz\u2019s \nfour industrial-sized gas chambers.\nWhat would you do if the police came for your \nneighbours and took them away? Would you say \nsomething? Who would you say it to? What if \nthey came for your parents? Your brothers and \nsisters? Your nieces and nephews? What if they \ncame for you?\nWhen the people of Berlin walk to school or \nwork, or meet with their friends, they do so \nwith reminders of these horrific events at their \nfeet. Every year Berlin residents gather in their \nneighbourhoods to clean their local stolpersteine  \nin order to help preserve the story that these \nstones tell. They are educated and warned about \nthe events that led up to these horrific events, \nand urged to make a commitment that they never \nhappen again. We all must do the same.

Each of these causes played a \nfundamental role in driving the world towards war. \nIt will be your task to determine which was the \nmost influential cause of the conflict.\nThe Treaty of Versailles  was one cause of \nWorld War II. At 11 a.m. on 11 November 1918, \na ceasefire was honoured and the \u2018war to end all \nwars\u2019 (or World War I) was ended. World War I \nhad ground an entire generation of young men \nthrough a cycle of death and futility as European \nempires fought to settle old scores. Germany, \naided by its Austro-Hungarian and Italian allies, \nhad sought to exert its power across Europe, \nopposed by the formidable alliance of the nations \nof France, England and Russia.\nIn the four years of World War I, 17 million soldiers \nwere killed. Many of these deaths were a result of \nthe stalemate  of trench warfare. In the final year of \nthe war, several factors forced its conclusion:\n1 All nations, particularly Germany, were \nexhausted from the conflict. Few nations had the economic or emotional will to continue \nthe fight.\n2 America had joined the war and committed \nfour million soldiers to the conflict.\n3 The S panish flu had decimated the fighting \ncapacity of all combatants (it would eventually \nkill 50\u00a0million people worldwide).\nThe conclusion of World War I led to the collapse \nof the Austro-Hungarian and Russian Empires. \nKaiser Wilhelm, the German leader blamed by \nmany for the conflict, \nhad fled his capital and \nabdicated  his powers as \nthe country descended \ninto chaos, lurching \nfrom one armed \nuprising to another. \nAs German soldiers \nmarched home, however, they were confident that \nthey had done their duty for the \u2018fatherland\u2019.\nThe deadliest blow of World War I was not \ndelivered in any battle. It was delivered on a paper \ndocument in June 1919 as we shall see after a \nrefresher on the causes of the war.KEY TERMS\nstalemate situation in which \nneither side in war can win or in \nwhich no progress is possible\nabdicate  when a monarch \ndecides to give up their throne \nand title\nACTIVITY 1.1\nCheck your understanding: the causes of World War I refresher\n Before World War I began in 1914, Europe was a bonfire waiting to be lit. The five empires of Britain, France, \nGermany, Austria-Hungary and Russia were each building their armies (this is known as militarism  ) and \nattempting to intimidate each other in a quest for land, wealth and influence around the world (this is known \nas imperialism  ). To convince their own citizens to join this quest for empire, a strong culture of national \npride and hatred of outsiders (known as nationalism ) was growing across the continent. \nCrucially,  all five empires were signed up to diplomatic agreements that committed them to helping each \nother in the event of an attack or invasion. France, Britain and Russia were partners in the Triple Entente  in \norder to protect themselves from the Triple Alliance  of Germany, Austria and Italy. \nBizarrely,  it was an event in the tiny nation of Bosnia that started it all when Gavrilo Princip, a Serbian \nBosnian nationalist, assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the future leader of the Austro-Hungarian \nEmpire. With Germany\u2019s blessing, Austria invaded Serbia in retaliation. However, an alliance existed \nbetween Russia and Serbia, and Russia soon mobilised to attack Austria. Germany had been quietly waiting \nfor this day and invaded France shortly afterwards. Within a month Europe was at war.\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",

Nationalism\nHitler proposed to tear up the Treaty of Versailles \nand reverse the decade of humiliation it had \nendured as a result of the Treaty. By creating the \nSturmabteilung  (SA) he was already flouting the \ncondition that Germany could not have an army \nlarger than 100  000. \nAt its peak the SA numbered two million \nstrong.

Lebensraum  \nliterally translates to \n\u2018living space\u2019. National \nSocialist ideology \nproposed that Germany \nneeded to expand its \nborders so it could \nmake use of the natural \nresources available in Eastern Europe. Hitler \nclaimed that Eastern Europe was not just a \ncreation of the Treaty of Versailles (much of the \nland in this region had been taken from Germany \nby the Treaty), but a place inhabited by people \nHitler saw as \u2018racially inferior\u2019.\nIn short, Hitler saw the people east of Germany \nas people who were unfit to inhabit land that \nHitler saw as Germany\u2019s for the taking, since they \nwere the \u2018master race\u2019. This theory of German and \n\u2018Aryan\u2019 superiority lay underneath much of its \npolitical agenda. Hitler\u2019s Lebensraum  ideology was \nnot just a threat to Germany\u2019s eastern neighbours. \nIt was also a direct challenge to the conditions of \nthe Treaty of Versailles.\n3. Anti-communism\nThe chaos in post-World War II Germany led to a \nrise in the popularity of communism. Despite the \nhorrors of the Russian Civil War and Stalin\u2019s rule, \nthe fundamental ideas of communism appealed to \nmany German people who had experienced the \neconomic failures of hyperinflation and the Great \nDepression.\nViolent clashes between German communists and \ngovernment forces were common.

The \npolicy of appeasement \nwas adopted by leaders \naround Europe to avoid \nconflict. Appeasement \nallowed Hitler to rebuild \nGermany, to break every \nclause in the Treaty of \nVersailles, and to trigger \nanother world war.\nFrom the moment he \nbecame Chancellor \nof Germany, Hitler \nbegan to exert power in the same way that other dictators around the \nworld had. His ideology made clear his desire \nto destroy the Treaty, invade Eastern Europe \nand rid Germany of \u2018undesirables\u2019. He began in \nearnest on 27 February 1933 when a mysterious \nfire raged through the Reichstag, home of the \nGerman government. The next day, Hitler \nenacted emergency powers and blamed the fire on \ncommunist agitators. This allowed him to ban all \ncommunist newspapers and imprison a number \nof communist leaders. What should have been a \nclear warning to European leaders was ignored.\nThe strength of Hitler\u2019s desire to assert power \nwith violence became obvious a year later on \n30 March 1934.

Again, nothing \nwas done to oppose \nthis act.\nOne year later, the \nreformation of Germany\u2019s \nmilitary strength was \ndemonstrated in the \nSpanish Civil War. Flying \nin support of the Fascist \nSpanish rebellion against the government, Luftwaffe  \n(German Air Force) bombers were secretly used \non 27 April 1937 to reduce the Spanish city of \nGuernica to rubble and, in part, turn the war to \nthe advantage of the fascists.

A hardline fascist state had\u00a0emerged.\nA month later, on 15\u00a0October, Hitler posed the \nmost daring challenge to the Treaty of Versailles \nby reforming the Wehrmacht  (the German Army) \nand rebuilding its strength.

After the fall of Singapore in in 1942, \nthe British Empire was not able to maintain its \npresence in Asia. Australia could no longer rely on \nBritain for national security. The cooperation of \nAustralian and US governments and armed forces \nin between 1942 and 1945 forged a stronger \nrelationship between the two nations.\nThe ANZUS and SEATO treaties\nIn 1951, as a new conflict flared up in Korea, the \nANZUS (Australia, New Zealand and United \nStates) Treaty was created. Australia and New \nZealand no longer feared a Japanese invasion, but the new postwar threat of communism, which \nhad spread to China and Korea, inspired the \ntwo nations to create a treaty between Australia, \nNew Zealand and the United States. This would \ncommit the three nations to working together, \ncommunicating with and relying on each other \nto ensure mutual security. The ANZUS Treaty \nwould ensure that Australia was committed to \ncombating the rise of communism in Korea, \nMalaysia and Vietnam in the decades to come.\nA second effort to combat the rise of communism \nwas formalised with the SEATO Treaty of 1954. \nThe South East Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO) \ncombined the efforts of the US, Great Britain, \nThailand, Pakistan, the Philippines, France, New \nZealand and Australia in a single group so they \ncould coordinate against communist expansion.\nACTIVITY 1.42\nResearch task\nBoth the ANZUS and the SEATO treaties played a role in Australian forces entering the Vietnam War in \nthe 1960s and, many argue, the pattern of Australian governments supporting US wars, like Australia\u2019s \ninvolvement in the invasion of Iraq in 2003.\n1 Research the history of Australia\u2019 s involvement in wars and conflicts since World War II.

This, combined with \nthe policy of appeasement, allowed Hitler\u2019s power \nto grow and led to him defying the conditions \nof the Treaty. Crucially, the Great Depression of \n1929 crippled the economies of Hitler\u2019s enemies \nand distracted them from his intentions.Write an evidence-based response to the \nfollowing question:\nWorld War II was caused by the Treaty of \nVersailles. To what extent do you agree?\nThis essay is asking you to think about, and decide \nbetween, two points of view:\n1 World War II was caused by more complex \nreasons than just the effects of the Treaty \nof Versailles \u2013 there were other events that \ncontributed more to the outbreak of war.\n2 The harshness of the co nditions of the Treaty \nof Versailles was the main reason for the \noutbreak of World War II.\nESSAY OPTION 2: Was it right to \ndrop the atomic bomb?\nDebate has raged over the morality of the US \nusing the atomic bomb to end the war with \nJapan. It was clear that Japan was willing to fight \nto the absolute last, even if US forces managed \nto invade Japan. The US also knew that Russia, \nhaving recently defeated Germany, had joined \nthe war against Japan and was looking to claim \nJapan\u2019s territory for itself. \nBe they military, political or moral, the reasons \nfor using the bomb were complex. What is known \nis that it brought an end to six years of war that \nhad killed millions of people across the world. It \nis also known that the use of the atomic bomb \nforced the world into a new era in which many \nsimilar weapons would be made, many of which \nwere much more powerful than the ones whose \nvast capacity for destruction had been used to \nterrify Japan into surrendering.\nWould Japan have surrendered anyway? Did \ndropping the bombs save lives by avoiding the \nneed for invasion? How much longer would the \nwar with Japan have lasted?

The \nthinkers of that time had no doubt that every \nhuman being has certain rights, no matter who \nor where they are. And yet, the world since 1945 \nhas seen a continued struggle to secure rights, \nparticularly for indigenous peoples around the \nworld. In our own times the idea of universal \nrights is under greater threat than ever. Australia \nmay be proud of its contribution to the creation \nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \nbut Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples \nhave had to struggle long and hard to translate \nthese principles into reality. Their courageous \ncampaigning has seen them draw upon the \ntechniques of the better-known civil rights \nmovement in the USA.\nAustralia has done some work toward ensuring \nthe rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait \nIslander peoples, but in slow steps. It was \nonly in 1962 that Aboriginal and Torres \nStrait Islander peoples won the right to vote \nin Federal elections, and it was only in 1967 \nthat they were voted by referendum to be \nincluded in the Australian census (the survey \nof our population) and to be subject to Federal \nlaw. More recently, the Mabo Decision, \nthe Report on the Stolen Generations, the \nNational Apology and Sorry Day have brought \nIndigenous issues more fully to the attention of \nAustralians. This has not, however, completed \nthe process of reconciliation that is still required \nto fully normalise relations between the First \nPeoples of Australia and its subsequent settlers. \nReconciliation is perhaps Australia\u2019s greatest \nchallenge. It will take the hearts and minds of \nthe young people who will soon become citizens \nwith the right to vote to devise an appropriate \nand fair settlement.Learning goals\nAfter completing this unit, you should be able to \nanswer these questions:\n\u2022 How has Australian society been affected by \nsignificant global events and changes in the \nperiod since 1945?\n\u2022 What was Australia\u2019s role in the drafting of \nthe United Nations Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights?\n\u2022 Why have Aboriginal and Torres Straits Islander \npeoples felt the need to fight for their rights?\n\u2022 Who is one individual who has played a key \nrole in this struggle for Aboriginal and Torres \nStrait Islander peoples rights in Australia?\n\u2022 How have Australian activists adopted the \ntechniques of the American Civil Rights \ncampaigners?\n\u2022 How significant have landmark events such as \nthe Mabo Decision, the Report on the Stolen \nGenerations and Sorry Day been in creating a \nfairer society for Aboriginal and Torres Strait \nIslander people?\n\u2022 At this point in the twenty-first century, what \ndo you believe are the next steps Australia \nneeds to take to create an accepting, respectful \nand supportive society for Aboriginal and \nTorres Strait Islander peoples?\n\u2022 What do you see as the main factors preventing \nfurther progress on Indigenous issues?\nIntroducing historical concepts \nand skills: sequencing chronology \nand cause and effect\nThroughout the chapters in this unit there will \nbe a special focus on the concept of sequencing \nchronology.

Understanding the order that events occurred in will allow you to see the bigger picture and enable you to make links between what you are studying and what you may already know. Look for opportunities to build your understanding of how to sequence events in a way that links different times, places, and groups.\nAnalysing cause and effect\nHistorians analyse the causes of historical events. One thing may seem to be the cause of an event, but closer examination might reveal multiple cause factors. Historians evaluate each cause individually in order to decide its importance. Sometimes several different causes interact. Historians distinguish between long-term causes (conditions or problems \nthat have existed for decades, even centuries), short-term causes (new problems occurring over a few years) and immediate causes (sudden developments occurring a few months or days before an event). Immediate causes are also called triggers or catalysts. Historians also distinguish between types of causes. Political causes are the actions of governments or their opponents or changes in political ideology. Economic causes are the pressure of unemployment, economic recession or sudden technological change. Social causes are issues relating to living conditions, working conditions or health and diet.\nOnce a historian has established the causes of \nan historical event, they measure and describe the effect these causes had on people. Were \nthe effects positive or negative? Did they bring benefits or cause harm? Historians evaluate whether the event did more good than harm. For example, the arrival of Europeans in Australia benefited settlers who were desperate for land, but it did enormous damage to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, disrupting their way of life and causing enormous loss of life.\u25b2 Source 2.1  On 13 February 2008, students from Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Sydney gave a celebratory cheer after watching the live  \ntelevision broadcast of Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd delivering an official Apology to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, \napologising in particular to the Stolen Generations\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",

It depicts \nCaptain Cook\u2019s landing on Australian shores under a British flag emblazoned with a pirate skull. Cook himself wears an eye patch typical of a pirate who has sailed the world and lives for theft, dispossession and violence.\nThe painting is a direct parody of the 1902 \npainting The Landing of Captain Cook at Botany Bay, 1770, by Melbourne artist E. Phillips Fox.\nFox\u2019s painting was created 114 years after the \noriginal event, and was not even created in Australia. Fox was commissioned by request after a wealthy Melbourne surgeon died and left money to the National Gallery of Victoria. The condition of the commission was that the painting had to be created in England, so Fox left Australia to tell the story of Australia.\nThe Landing of Captain Cook at Botany Bay, 1770 \nexists as a European version of events. Cook has long existed as a notable figure in Australian history, said to be the first person who \u2018discovered\u2019 Australia. In Fox\u2019s painting Cook appears as a brave, benevolent explorer. He raises his hand to calm the concerns of his troops and crew, who appear threatened by the naked, faceless and aggressive \u2018natives\u2019 in the background. Fox\u2019s painting presents a version of events that suggests that the English brought civilisation to an untamed land.

In the century leading up to European arrival in \nAustralia, great empires like the British Empire had been sailing to all corners of \nthe world to claim land, wealth and power. Debate surrounds which European \nnation was first to set foot in Australia, but there is little argument about those \nwho stayed. In 1770 Captain Cook landed in Botany Bay, near modern day \nSydney, and claimed the land for the British Crown.

The 1967 Referendum  \nmade a minor change to the wording of this \nimportant national document. This was the \nculmination of a decades-long struggle for \nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to \nbe recognised and included \nin Australian society. \nAboriginal and Torres Strait \nIslander peoples would \nnow be counted in the \nnational census, meaning \nthat they \u2018officially\u2019 existed \nas Australians. The obvious \nquestion, therefore, asks, why \ndid they \u2018unofficially\u2019 exist \nbefore the referendum?\nThe successful referendum result appeared to \nbe the end of a long struggle. However, critics \nof the 1967 Referendum claim that subsequent \nAustralian governments have rarely used the \nresults of 1967 to improve the lives of Australia\u2019s \nfirst peoples. The struggle for Aboriginal and \nTorres Strait Islander peoples rights and freedoms \nhas had to continue, with significant victories \nmoving the struggle forward. Progress has been slow. Tellingly, at the conclusion of the 2019 \nAustralian Federal Election, Western Australian \nsenator Ken Wyatt was the first ever Indigenous \nAustralian appointed to the role of Indigenous \nAffairs Minister.

The declaration stated \nthat all people, regardless of culture, creed or where \nthey live, have inherent rights.\nThe United Nations grew from the ashes of \nWorld War II. It sought to resolve conflict and \ncreate an enduring peace for the whole world. \nBy adopting the UDHR, the UN promoted \nideas of civil and legal rights, freedom of speech, \nreligion and political association.

In actual fact, \nAustralia was never officially \ndeclared to be \u2018empty\u2019 by \nCook, or the people of the \nFirst Fleet who arrived in \nAustralia in 1788. Australia\u2019s \nearly European arrivals were \nnot able to create a treaty \nwith the local tribes in order to acquire land, so the \nidea that it belonged to no one became a tool, rather than a law, that allowed the British settlers to push \nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples off \ntheir land.2\nThis idea of Australia as an empty land persisted \nand was used to dispossess Aboriginal and Torres \nStrait Islander peoples across the continent \nuntil NSW Governor Sir Richard Bourke \nenshrined the idea into law. On 10 October 1835 \nBourke declared Australia to be terra nullius  in \na proclamation that stated any people found \noccupying land without the NSW Government\u2019s \nofficial approval were to be considered trespassers. \nThis opened the floodgates for the dispossession \nof Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples \nfrom their traditional lands.\nThe idea of terra nullius  would face its biggest \nchallenge centuries later when Aboriginal and \nTorres Strait Islander peoples sought to dispute \nthe idea that such a proclamation could ever \nlegally have been made.\nThe impact of disease\nMore convicts and settlers followed after the \nestablishment of Australia as a British colony. \nSo did  smallpox , a disease that Aboriginal and \nTorres Strait Islander peoples in the New South \nWales area had no immunity to. It is impossible \nto measure the impact smallpox had on them, but \nmost of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander \npeoples of NSW were almost wiped out. Fleeing \nthe spread of the epidemic, they abandoned their \ntraditional homes, scattering north and south. \nWhen David Collins, Judge-Advocate of the new \ncolony, took an Aboriginal man who had been \nliving among the British to search for his fellow \nAboriginal people, they had vanished.2.2  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander \npeoples\u2019 struggle for rights before 1965\n2  http://theconversation.com/discovery-settlement-or-invasion-the-power-of-language-in-australias-historical-narrative-57097\n\u25b2 Source 2.9  Captain Cook\u2019s landing at Botany Bay , illustrated by \nGeorge Soper\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",

  "Page 192": "CHAPTER 2  RIGH TS AND FREEDOMS (1945\u2013THE PRESENT)180\nThe beginning of the end of the \nWhite Australia Policy:  1966\nThe election of Harold Holt as Australia\u2019s \nPrime Minister, succeeding Australia\u2019s then-\nlongest-serving Prime Minister Robert Menzies, \nheralded a new age for Australia\u2019s policy towards \nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples \nand immigrants. One of the first policies \nHolt targeted was the White Australia Policy. \nSince 1901 various migration acts had directly \ndiscriminated against \nnon-European migrants to \nAustralia. These laws had \nbeen used to restrict the \nnumber of non-white migrants and to make it \neasier to deport non-white migrants who were \nalready in the country. This was seen as a way to \nprotect Australia\u2019s links to Britain. In the 1940s, \nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and \n\u2018non-white\u2019 Australians made up less than 2% of \nthe Australian population.46\nAfter the conclusion of World War II, Arthur \nCalwell, Australia\u2019s first-ever Minister for \nImmigration, made a speech which stated that, in \na post-World-War-II world, Australia needed to \n\u2018populate or perish\u2019 to survive whatever came next.47 \nThis meant that Australia had to relax its views on \nimmigration. By 1966 the Australian Government, \nunder Holt, made the first genuine steps to do so. \nA Migration Act  was passed that made it easier for \npeople of any nation around the world to migrate to \nAustralia. While it would take many years for this \nact to result in a properly multicultural population, \nit heralded a new era in Australian thinking.The Wave Hill walk-off: 1966\nOn 23 August 1966, 200 Aboriginal and Torres \nStrait Islander stockmen and labourers and their \nfamilies walked off the remote Wave Hill cattle \nstation in the Northern Territory. This was a \nstrike to protest low pay and poor conditions. \nThe station was owned by the English aristocratic \nVestey family, who paid their Aboriginal and \nTorres Strait Islander workers at least 50 per \ncent less than non-Aboriginal and Torres \nStrait Islander workers.48 During the strike, the \nGurindji  community, led by Vincent Lingiari, \ndecided to make a claim for the return of their \ntraditional lands, the very lands they had walked \noff in protest.\nIn August 1967, as negotiations between the \nstrikers and the Vestey family continued, Lingiari \nand the Gurindji people made camp at Daguragu \n(Wattie Creek). This site was closer to Gurundji \nsacred sites. The move was symbolic of their \nconnection to, and custodianship of, their land. \nTheir demands for access to their land would \ndevelop into an eight-year struggle of wills. While \nit was deemed that the occupation of Daguragu \nwas illegal, the remote geographic location meant \nthat the Gurundji people had some bargaining \npower. Lingiari and his people knew how to make \na claim in the language of white Australian. They \nwrote a sign in English, erected it and staked \ntheir claim.\nThe strikers patiently settled in for a slow strike. \nMeanwhile, important moves were being made \nelsewhere in the struggle for Aboriginal and \nTorres Strait Islander peoples\u2019 civil rights.\nACTIVITY 2.16\nCheck your understanding\n1 What was the White Australia Policy?

This was a 50-word test \nthat could be given in any language, regardless of \nwhether a person could understand that language \nor not. Migrants had to correctly write down \nthe entire passage that was dictated to them. \nPeople who wanted to migrate to Australia had \nto pass this test before they were allowed to enter \nAustralia. The Dictation Test was designed to keep \npeople out. After 1909, no one ever passed the test.\nThe Dictation Test was a key tool of the White \nAustralia Policy. It allowed the Australian \nGovernment to claim that they were not \ndiscriminating against people on the basis of race. \nBy using the Dictation Test they could claim that \npeople were being rejected based on their education.\nThe Immigration Restriction \nAct was a very effective \npiece of legislation. By \n1945 nearly 99 per cent of \npeople in Australia were \nfrom white backgrounds. \nThe Australian Government \nfurther tried to ensure the arrival of the type of \nmigrants they wanted by investing in assisted \npassage schemes.  Between 1920 and 1929 \nmore than 220  000 migr ants from Britain \nreceived subsidised or free passage to Australia \nas a result of laws like the Empire Settlement \nAct (1922).

Australia\u2019s population was \nalso influenced by political situations in Asia, \nwhich inspired a fear of communism, and various \nconflicts like the Vietnam War.\nAt the end of World War II Australia had an \nestimated 250  000 jobs that needed to be fil led. \nThis labour shortage helped lead to changes in the \nkinds of people who were migrating to Australia.\nAssisted passage and assisted \nmigration\nIn order to come to Australia, displaced persons \nwere required to sign two-year work contracts in \nexchange for their travel to Australia, including \nfood and board during travel. The Australian Government was worried that the Australian \npublic would react negatively if these \u2018New \nAustralians\u2019 were seen to be taking their jobs. \nBecause of this, all migrants, regardless of \ntheir education and experience or the jobs they \nhad had in Europe, were required to work as \nlabourers.\nSome people who migrated to Australia got jobs \nworking in factories or doing difficult labouring \njobs like working in brick kilns. The work of these \nlabourers was integral to Australia\u2019s growth in the \npostwar period.\nOne of the largest projects that was completed \nusing the labour of these migrants was the Snowy \nMountains Hydro-Electric Scheme. More than \n100 000 people w orked on this project, most of \nthem assisted migrants from Poland, Germany, \nGreece, Italy, Poland and Yugoslavia.\n\u25b6 Source  5.16 Australia: Land of tomorrow \u2013 this 1948 poster \nwas displayed in displaced persons camps in Europe\n\u25b2 Source 5.15  Officials switched the power on from the Snowy \nMountains Hydro-Electricity Scheme to the NSW electricity grid on \n30 April 1959.

This scheme \nbecame known as the \n\u2018ten-pound Pom\u2019 scheme, \nsince adults only had to pay \nten pounds to migrate to \nAustralia. The Australian \nGovernment covered the \nrest of the cost, and children travelled free. \nBetween 1945 and 1982 more than one million \nBritish migrants participated in this program.\nThe \u2018Bring out a Briton\u2019 scheme came about in \npart to address concerns about the number of \npeople migrating from Europe in the 1950s \nand 1960s. This scheme ran from 1957 until \n1982. It encouraged individuals and community \ngroups in Australia to sponsor a British family \nand help them to find housing and employment \nin Australia. The Australian Government also \nsubsidised the passage of these families to \nAustralia.The rise of communism\nAfter China became a communist state in 1949, \ncountries like Australia began to fear that other \nnations would soon convert to communism \nas well. The fear was that communism  would \nspread across the world. This fear was known \nas \u2018the domino theory\u2019 \u2013 the idea was that once \none country converted to communism, other \nneighbouring nations would inevitably follow. \nAustralia\u2019s involvement in the Korean War, in \nwhich the Australian Army joined the US Army \nin fighting the communist armies of China and \nKorea, had only served to strengthen this belief.\nThe Colombo Plan was developed in 1951 \nto create stronger ties between countries like \nAustralia, New Zealand and Canada, and \nAsian nations like Malaysia and Sri Lanka. \nThe program provided aid in the form of loans, \nequipment, food and scholarships. The Australian \nGovernment believed that participation in \nthe Colombo Plan would help to increase \nliving standards in supported nations, creating \nstability that would ensure these nations were \nprotected from the spread of communism.

With the knowledge you have gained \nabout Australia\u2019s migration history, critically read and analyse the article and consider the issues it raises.\nYes, it is time to rethink our immigration intake \u2013 to put more focus on families\nBy Alex Reilly, Professor of Law at the University of Adelaide\nKristina Keneally, Labor\u2019s home affairs spokesperson, is calling for a reset on migration as we emerge from the \ncoronavirus crisis. \nShe noted in an article over the weekend that migration had been responsible for \u2018over half of Australia\u2019s economic \ngrowth\u2019 since 2005. \nHowever, she argued that in a post-COVID environment with a sluggish economy, we need to focus instead on skilling \nup Australian workers to perform the jobs in the health, hospitality and other industries that have been the focus of \nskilled migration in recent times.\nMany economists disagree with Keneally\u2019s connection between migration and the availability of local jobs. They point \nout that migrant workers contribute to overall economic growth, leading to a net increase in new jobs available for local \nworkers. \nThere is also a risk that, despite her best intentions, Keneally\u2019s rhetoric of \u2018Australians first\u2019 will feed nationalist, anti-\nimmigration sentiments that have no relationship to the economy and job opportunities.\nA review of our migration intake is overdue\nKeneally is right to call for a review of \u2018the shape and size\u2019 of our migration intake, although not in the way she was \nsuggesting. \nAt the top of this review should be a consideration of the balance between the two major streams of our migration \nprogram \u2013 skilled migrants and family migrants. \nCurrent immigration policy favours skilled over family migrants, significantly underestimating the importance of family \nfor the well-being and potentially the productivity of new migrants, as well as Australia\u2019s long-term national interests. \nThere was a substantial shift in the balance between these streams from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s.\nIn 1995\u201396, permanent migration was comprised of 58% family, 25% skilled and 17% humanitarian migrants. A decade \nlater, the overall migrant make-up had changed dramatically: 62% skilled, 29% family and 9% humanitarian. \nThese proportions have remained about the same ever since. In 2018-19, there were 109,713 migrants (62%) in the \nskilled stream, 47&&247 (27%) in the family stream and 18762 (11%) in the humanitarian stream. \nAt the same time, temporary migration of short-term skilled workers, working holiday makers, international students \nand New Zealanders on temporary special category visas has risen dramatically to over 1.2 million in December 2016. \nIf all temporary migrants with work rights had a job, they would constitute over 10% of the Australian workforce.\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 261": "253 5.4 DIFFErENT pErSpECTIVES  AND  INTE rprETATIONS  OF AuSTrALIA\u2019S IMMI grATION  HISTO rY\nImmigration is about relationships\nPreferencing skilled migrants over family migrants is the inverse of the US, where most migrants come via family \nconnections. Unlike Australia, this also includes the potential for migrants to sponsor siblings. \nWhat is sometimes lost in Australia, with a single-minded focus on migration to boost the economy, is that \nimmigration is not only about economic growth. It is also about relationships. \nPermanent migrants are future citizens. Migration builds community, and the ability of migrants to sponsor their \nbroader family will deepen their connections and commitment to Australia.\nThe family migration program enables Australians to sponsor parents and children living overseas, partners, and in \nsome cases their remaining relatives. \nOne of the effects of our focus on skilled migration has been the increase of new migrants with no extended family in \nAustralia. \nAlthough skilled worker visas allow for partners and children to accompany them, there is no provision for extended \nfamily. This makes these migrants potentially more vulnerable and isolated, less committed to Australia and, some \nhave suggested, less productive as workers. \nIf they were allowed to enter Australia, these extended family members could offer emotional support and practical \nassistance to their loved ones working here, such as child care. \nMost temporary migrant workers, meanwhile, have no entitlement to be accompanied by any family at all. Only some \ninternational students can have family accompany them as a support person while they study.\nA growing waiting list for partners and parents\nThe difficulty skilled migrants have sponsoring their parents to migrate to Australia provides a dramatic example of \njust how restrictive current family migration options are.\nIn 2018\u201319, just 1218 non-contributory parent visas were granted out of tens of thousands of applicants. The waiting \nperiod is at least 30 years, longer than many of these parents have left to live. \nThe home affairs website no longer provides waiting times, stating only \nfamily migration visas are in high demand. It might take many years for this visa to be granted . \nThe waiting time for partner visas for all Australian citizens and permanent residents has also grown as the number \nof allocated placements has been cut. The home affairs website currently says 90% of applicants will be processed in \n21 months. \nMigration numbers are destined to drop dramatically as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020\u201321. When the \neconomy and our borders open up, there is an opportunity to reflect on what is the best balance of skilled and family \nmigration. \nAttracting the most accomplished skilled migrants will undoubtedly continue to be a driver of migration policy. \nHowever, in choosing numbers in the skilled and family streams, it is also vital the government factor in the role \nof extended family for the well-being and productivity of migrant workers, as well as the importance of family for \ncommunity cohesion and a migrant\u2019s sense of connection and commitment to Australia.\n\u25b2 Source 5.35  \u2019Yes, it is time to rethink our immigration intake \u2013 to put more focus on families\u2019, Alex Reilly, The Conversation  website, \n5 May 2020\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",

With the establishment of the British \ncolonies came waves of immigration. Much \nof this immigration was caused by economic \nincentives, such as the gold rush, or from \nAustralia being advertised as a workers\u2019 \nparadise. These early immigrants began a long \ntradition of foreigners travelling to Australia to make it their home, build new lives and \nfind prosperity here. The social and economic \ngrowth that resulted from these waves of \nimmigration has helped to make Australia the \nsuccessful and multicultural society it is today. \nDebates about immigration and diversity will \ncontinue to be held in Australia well into the \nfuture.

Therefore, some of the vegetation was \nremoved and replaced with foreign palm species \nto match what viewers would perceive as a typical \nparadise.

While they were expecting \nto find an isolated paradise, in reality they were \nfaced with hordes of other visitors, ruining the \nvery attraction they were coming to see. While an \naverage of 171 people visited the bay in 2008, its \npopularity, especially within the Chinese market, \nled to over 5000 daily visitors in 2018, with \n200 boats arriving every day.\nStudies from Thailand\u2019s Kasetsart University \nshowed that approximately 90 per cent of the \ncoral system had been damaged, largely from boat \nanchors, and that the site needed time to naturally \nrecover. In response to this degradation, Thailand\u2019s \nDepartment of National Parks, Wildlife and \nPlant Conservation closed the beach to visitors \non 1 June 2018. As part of this management, coral \nwas propagated  from local species to help restore \nthe ecosystem, and a restriction was placed on \nboats, forcing them to remain 300 metres away \nfrom the shoreline. Although the closure was \ninitially meant to last only four months, it was \nextended indefinitely to allow the environment \ntime to fully recover.\nEarly observations have shown that these steps \nhave been successful in rehabilitating  the site. \nBlacktip reef sharks have returned to the area, \nwhich is a sign of its returning ecological  health. \nThe site is expected to reopen to visitors once it has \nrecovered further.

Elements of an ecosystem are interconnected through processes such as nutrient cycles and energy transfers. For example, Figure 7.6 shows the different processes within the carbon cycle.\nIn the carbon cycle, carbon dioxide is released from organisms during \nrespiration and absorbed from the atmosphere into plant material via photosynthesis. Dead and decaying organisms release carbon back to the atmosphere. Organic matter that doesn\u2019t break down turns into fossil fuels such as coal, which is a resource used by people.\nNatural processes often involve multiple spheres and can link different \ntypes of environments.

It is an important \nmeasure of the health of an environment. The \nnatural components and processes within a \nhealthy environment help to maintain high levels \nof biodiversity. On the other hand, when the \nbiodiversity of an environment is reduced it is \na sign that the environment has been modified, \ndamaged or has experienced degradation .\nHow are environments classified?\nGeographers categorise environments based on \ntheir combinations of geographic characteristics . \nIn land-based environments, these include climate , \nelevation , topography , vegetation  and soil types. In \nmarine environments, characteristics include water \nquality  and depth. The location of a place often \nplays a large role in determining its environment.\nFor example, a forest found near the equator \nwithin the tropical climate zone, such as a forest \nin Indonesia, is likely to have a consistently warm \ntemperature and experience high rainfalls. It will \ntherefore be classified as a tropical rainforest. \nHowever, a forest located within in a wet \ntemperate zone, like a forest in Tasmania, will be \nclassified as a cool temperate rainforest.\nThe characteristics of human or built environments \nvary significantly between different natural environments. They can \nbe compared based on \ntheir population density  \nand features such as roads, \nbuildings and land uses.\nAlthough environments \ncan be classified based \non similar characteristics, \nthey can also vary greatly \nwithin these classifications. \nFigure 7.7 shows three \ndistinct examples of coastal \nenvironments that vary based \non the natural processes that \nformed them and their level \nof modification by people.\nDue to the interconnections \nbetween different types of \nenvironments, the boundaries \nbetween environments are \noften unclear.

This means that the amount of water gained through precipitation is less than the amount of water lost through evaporation and transpiration each year.\nAlthough their amount of precipitation varies, \ndeserts are generally defined as places that receive an average of less than 250 mm of precipitation each year. The Sahara Desert (Figure 7.11) is the world\u2019s largest hot desert. It is located in northern Africa and receives an annual average of 100 mm of precipitation. In contrast, Antarctica is the largest cold desert. It receives an average of 166 millimetres of precipitation each year. Vegetation within deserts is sparse \u2013 in many hyper-arid deserts it is non-existent.\nForests\nForests are environments dominated by tree cover. The Food and Agriculture Organization define forests as land with a tree crown cover of more than 10 per cent and an area of more than 0.5 hectares. As shown in Figure 7.10, there are many types of forests, determined primarily by the local climate.\nFigure 7.12 shows the Amazon Rainforest, \nwhich is a tropical rainforest covering more than five million square kilometres in the northern region of South America. It has a very high biodiversity, containing ten per cent of the world\u2019s known species of plants, animals and insects. The Dandenong Ranges is located 35 km east of Melbourne\u2019s CBD.

This transformation occurs roughly every three years as floodwaters travel more than 1000 kilometres to recharge the entire basin.\nCoastal environments\nCoastal environments are the link between the land and sea. They transition from components typically found in inland environments, such as dune vegetation, to components typically found in marine environments, such as coral reefs. As shown in Table 7.1, coastal environments are divided into different zones: offshore, nearshore, foreshore and backshore.Some rivers, lakes and wetlands are permanently inundated or flowing, whereas others are intermittent (they flow only occasionally). Seasonal floods, variable flows and drought are natural processes essential for maintaining these ecosystems. \nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",

However, marine \nenvironments can vary \nsignificantly, from \nshallow coastal regions \nto the 11-kilometre-\ndeep Mariana Trench \nin the western Pacific \nOcean.\nMarine environments \ncan be divided into two \nmain categories: coastal \nand open ocean.

However, the temperature, salinity , acidity , turbidity , \navailability of light, nutrient levels and degree \nof dissolved oxygen  of seawater can vary \nsignificantly. These differences depend on the \ngeographical location of the seawater, particularly \nits latitude, its depth, the movement of ocean \ncurrents and the impacts of nearby environments \n(for example, the discharge of rivers into coastal \nregions).\nVariations in the non-living components of a \nmarine environment can create different habitats \nand thus determine the types of organisms that \nlive within them.

On a local scale, \nenvironments change owing to the processes \noccurring within an ecosystem, for example \nphotosynthesis, nutrient cycling, erosion or \nlongshore drift.\nDespite these changes, undisturbed natural \nenvironments are usually in a state of equilibrium . \nThis means that all of the components and \nprocesses within an ecosystem are balanced. For \nexample, if a tree dies within a forest, it will decay \nand add nutrients to the soil. Its death provides \nspace and food so that a new tree can grow in its \nplace. Natural disturbances such as landslides and \nbushfires can disrupt an environment\u2019s balance \nand lead to significant changes until a system once \nagain reaches a state of equilibrium.Human activities are \nhaving an increasingly \nlarge impact on \nenvironments by \ncausing disturbances \nlike the removal of \nvegetation at a local \nscale, or the large-scale \nremoval of an entire forest. When the disturbances \ncaused by these activities are severe enough to \nprevent ecosystems from recovering, the changes \ncan be significant and unsustainable.\nHuman-induced  environmental changes can be \ndirect or indirect. For example, clearing a forest \nto use the land for agriculture is a direct cause of \nchange, whereas an increase in population leading \nto a subsequent increase in demand for food is an \nindirect cause of change.7.3 Factors that influence environmental \nchange\nFOCUS QUESTIONS\n\u2022 In what ways do environments change?\n\u2022 What are the causes of these changes?\n \nFigure  7.25 Changes to forests in British Colombia, Canada, due to natural pro cesses such as bushfires (left) and human \nactivities such as deforestation (right)\nACTIVITY 7.6\n1 What evidence in Figure 7.25 suggests that the deforestation was due to human activities?\nKEY TERMS\nstate of equilibrium  a balance \nbetween all of the components \nwithin an ecosystem\nhuman-induced  changes \ncaused by human activities (in \ncontrast to natural changes)\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",

The time scales \nunder consideration are usually at least a decade, but \nare often discussed in terms of spans of thousands \nor even millions of years. Climate change is a \nnatural process that is responsible for cycles of ice \nages. An ice age is a cycle during which ice expands \nover much of the world\u2019s land surface, after which \nwarmer interglacial periods take place during which \nmuch of the ice melts and sea levels rise.\nThere are many factors responsible for climate \nchange, like variations in the Sun\u2019s radiation, \nvariations in the Earth\u2019s orbit, and changes in \nthe composition of the gases that make up the \natmosphere. When solar radiation hits the Earth, \nsome of it is absorbed and some is reflected back \ninto space. However, some atmospheric gases, \ncalled greenhouse gases, absorb and reflect this \nheat back towards the Earth. This is known as the greenhouse effect  (see Figure 7.26).

The three most common types \nof greenhouse gas are:\n\u2022 carbon dioxide, which is emitted through \nthe burning of fossil fuels such as coal (see \nFigure 7.27)\n\u2022 methane , which is emitted during the \nproduction and transport of coal, natural gas \nand oil, and also emitted by livestock and other \nagricultural practices\n\u2022 nitrous oxide, which is emitted from various \nagricultural and industrial activities.\nThe increase in the volume of these greenhouse gases \nin the Earth\u2019s atmosphere is causing the enhanced \ngreenhouse effect. This results in more heat being \nabsorbed by the atmosphere (see Figure 7.26). As \na result, the Earth\u2019s average temperature is rising, \nprecipitation patterns are changing, ice sheets and \nglaciers are melting, sea levels are rising and ocean \nwaters are becoming more acidic.\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, \nanthropogenic climate change is becoming an \nincreasingly significant cause of environmental \nchange on a global scale.\n\u25bc Figure  7.26 The enhanced greenhouse effect means more heat is trapped a nd re-emitted by greenhouse gasesKEY TERMS\ngreenhouse effect  an increase \nin the amount of carbon \ndioxide and other gases in the \natmosphere, that is believed \nto be the cause of a gradual \nwarming of the surface of \nthe Earth\nanthropogenic  caused by \nhuman activity\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",

In geography we classify \nthese impacts as environmental, economic or \nsocial. We also assess the extent of these impacts \nover varying temporal  and spatial scales .\nAlthough environmental changes can lead \nto predominantly negative environmental \nimpacts, there are \noften economic or \nsocial benefits that are \ndriving the change. For \nexample, unsustainable \nagriculture and \ndeforestation in Kenya \nhas led to short-term \neconomic and social \nbenefits for many local \npeople.

In the \n1960s the rivers that supplied water to the lake \nwere diverted so that the water could be used for \nirrigation. Since then, most of the lake has dried \nup and has become a desert, destroying the local \nfishing and agricultural industries and causing one \nof the planet\u2019s worst environmental disasters.\nHabitat fragmentation\nHabitat fragmentation is when a large area of \ncontinuous habitat is divided into a number \nof smaller areas. This changes the spatial \ndistribution of the remaining habitat, leaving \npopulations of species isolated and eliminating \nthe interconnection between them. Habitat \nfragmentation can occur naturally due to \nevents such as large-scale bushfires or lava \nflows following a volcanic eruption. However, \nhumans are more often responsible for habitat \nfragmentation through things like logging forests \nfor agriculture, urban development, and the \nbuilding of roads and railway lines.\nThe main impact of habitat fragmentation is the \nreduction in the size of a habitat. This particularly \nimpacts larger species \nthat need large areas in \nwhich to roam. It also \nincreases competition \namong species for \nfood and other \nresources. Figure 7.31 demonstrates how some species that adapted to \nliving within an environment, such as the interior \nof a forest, can find themselves living on what \nare now the edges of that environment. This new \nhabitat may not have suitable conditions in terms \nof shade, temperature and wind protection.\nAnother major impact of habitat fragmentation \nis a reduction in genetic diversity. Fragmented \nanimal populations have a smaller pool of \nbreeding partners. This can lead to genetic \nabnormalities and an increased vulnerability \nto disease. The overall result is a reduction in \nbiodiversity. Scotland\u2019s ancient Caledonian \nForest once covered the entire island, but now \nit only exists in fragments due to widespread \ndeforestation. Species such as the red squirrel and \nwood ant are not able to cross the open ground \nbetween isolated forest fragments. This has led to \nlocal extinctions, alterations to the local food web, \nand severe losses in biodiversity.\nChanging river flows and reducing \nwater quality\nAll civilisations rely on inland water sources \nfor their survival. As such, inland water \nsources are among the most modified and \ndegraded environments on Earth. One of \nthe biggest changes to river environments is \nflow regulation  through the construction of \ndams. By constructing dams, rivers are regulated \nto ensure they provide a reliable supply of water \n\u25bc Figure  7.31 Habitat fragmentation turns one large environment into multipl e, smaller environments\nEdge habitat and edge species increaseInterior habitat and interior species decrease\nEdge habitat with edge speciesInterior habitat with interior speciesFragmentationKEY TERM\nflow regulation  controlling \na river\u2019s flow, water level and \nvariability to meet the demands \nof domestic, industrial and \nagricultural use\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",

However, as \nshown in Figure 7.32, flow regulation causes a \nrange of negative impacts on river environments.\nDams are also used to control river levels in \norder to prevent flooding. Although flood \nprevention is often essential for protecting \nhuman environments like urban and agricultural \nlandscapes, flooding is an essential process in river \nenvironments. It provides an interconnection \nbetween river channels and their floodplains and \nis essential in maintaining the health of wetlands.\nOn a smaller scale, the health of rivers is impacted \nby removing or degrading riparian vegetation, \nadding pollutants to the water supply, and \nmodifying catchments to suit the needs of people \nand their communities.\nOne measure of river health is water quality. \nIndicators used to monitor river health include \nwater temperature, amount of dissolved oxygen, \nsalinity, turbidity, acidity and nutrient levels. \nPoor water quality can impact the health of \na river system. For example, excess nutrients \nfrom agricultural fertilisers washing into a river \nsystem, or stormwater combined with warm water \ntemperatures, can cause large amounts of toxic blue-green algae to grow (this is called an algal \nbloom). Blue-green algae pose a serious health \nthreat to both humans and animals.\nRivers in Bangladesh are both a sacred and an \nessential part of life for local people, who rely on \nthem for transportation and employment.

The interconnection between rivers and \nthe ocean means that waste material entering \nriver systems such as the Buriganga River (see \nFigure 7.33) will eventually wash out to the ocean \nand continue to impact marine environments and \nthe local fishing industry.\nThe impacts of anthropogenic  \nclimate change\nAnthropogenic climate change is expected to have \nfar-reaching impacts on all types of environments. \nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change (IPCC), the global average temperature has already \nrisen by 0.85\u00b0C since \n1880. It is expected to \ncontinue to rise by at \nleast another degree by \n2100 (see Figure 7.40).\nThese temperature changes will cause heatwaves \nand changes to rainfall patterns, which is \nlikely to increase the frequency and length \nof droughts and the likelihood of bushfires. \nClimate change will also force many species to \nmigrate as the climate of their original habitat \nbecomes unsuitable. In addition to this, habitat \nfragmentation means that some species will \nnot be able to migrate and therefore will be \nvulnerable to local extinction.\nAnthropogenic climate change is also expected \nto raise sea levels due to thermal expansion  \nand melting glaciers and ice sheets. The IPCC \nhave projected that the average global sea level \ncould rise by between 26 and 82 centimetres by \n2100 (see Figure 7.41). This will have disastrous \u25b2 Figure  7.39 Fish and seafood consumption per person per year \nACTIVITY 7.10\n1 Refer to Figure 7.39.\na Describe the global distribution of fish consumed per person using the Pattern, Quantification, \nException method (see Developing Geographical Concepts and Skills 7.1).\nb Suggest a factor that might have contributed to this distributio n.\nc What impact are high levels of fish consumption having on m arine environments?\nKEY TERMS\nriparian zone  the edge of a river\nthermal expansion  increase in \nthe volume of a material due to \nan increase in temperature\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",

This means that it still has natural features \nthat support a healthy penguin colony. All \nother penguin colonies on the island have been \ndestroyed.\nAs described in the excerpt in Figure 7.50, \nthese natural characteristics sparked the \ninterest of property developers and in 1927 the \nSummerlands Estate was established, subdividing \nthe region into 986 residential housing blocks. By \n1985 the estate contained 183 houses, one motel, \none shop, a nine-hole golf course and a network \nof roads throughout the estate.The impacts of change: penguin \ndeaths\nDuring the 1950s the Department of Fisheries \nand Wildlife began to realise that the size of \nthe Little Penguin population in the region was \nfalling rapidly. The local penguin habitat had been \nreduced in size, degraded by vegetation removal \nand weed infestation, and fragmented by the \nconstruction of roads. Hundreds of penguins were \nkilled each year by residents\u2019 dogs, wild foxes and \nroad accidents.\nWith a further 2000 residents expected to move \ninto the remaining vacant blocks, a 1984 study \nby Phillip Island Nature Parks projected that the \npenguin colony would become extinct by 1997 \n(see Figure 7.51). In addition to environmental \nconcerns, the economic sustainability of the \nregion was also at risk. The closure of the Penguin \nParade would have been a disaster for the local \ntourism industry and the local economy.\nEnvironmental management: \nPenguin Protection Plan\nIn 1985, John Cain, Premier of Victoria, \nannounced the establishment of the Penguin \nProtection Plan. His decision was based on \nlobbying from conservation groups and on \nconsultation with local residents and the local \ntourism industry. Cain justified his decision based \non sustainability, stating that: \nyou ha ve an obligation as the custodians of the \nland or people responsible for the time being to \nsee the long term and not just the immediate past \nand the immediate future.2 \u25b2 Figure  7.50 Excerpt from a 1927 Phillip Island Holidays \nDevelopment brochure\n2 https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-08/phillip-island-when-penguins-won-and-land-owners-lost/9464698\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",

The Victorian Government \nwould buy properties within the Summerlands \nEstate and then remove houses and other \nurban infrastructure like power lines. Foxes \nand weeds were also to be removed, and the \npenguin habitat was to be revegetated and \nturned into a wildlife reserve. In 2011 the final \nhouses were removed from the estate.

  "Page 324": "317 7 .7 casE study: using aBoriginal knowl EdgE to manag E kakadu\nEnvironmental change: a \nnew fire regime\nPrior to European settlement, the \nAboriginal peoples managed Kakadu \nusing fire. Low-intensity bushfires  \nwere used to aid hunting, protect \nfood resources, clear campsites, \ncommunicate between groups, and as \npart of spiritual and cultural rituals. \nOver time, traditional fire regimes  \nbecame an essential component of the \nlocal ecosystem, helping to provide \nhabitat for species that had adapted to \nthese conditions.\nWhen Europeans arrived in the \nregion, many Aboriginal people left \ntheir land, were removed, or died of \ndisease. This meant that traditional \nfire practices decreased in frequency. \nThe landscape changed accordingly.\nDuring the wet season, monsoonal \nrains lead to rapid plant growth. In \nthe absence of traditional burning during the dry \nseason, this vegetation dried out and accumulated \ninto a large fuel load. This led to more frequent \nhigh-intensity bushfires . While low-intensity \nfires had benefitted the environment, these \nmore powerful fires were destructive, altering \nthe balance of the ecosystem and changing the \ndistribution of plants and animals.\nEnvironmental change: pests  \nand weeds\nAnother example of environmental change within \nKakadu is the spread of pests and weeds. Weed \nspecies present in Kakadu include Mimosa, a \nwoody shrub from Central America that forms \nthickets across floodplains, and Salvinia, an aquatic \nfern that can choke waterways. Feral animals \nintroduced to the region, both intentionally and \naccidentally, include cattle, pigs, horses, cats, dogs, \nrats, cane toads and Asian water buffalo.\nAsian water buffalo were introduced in Kakadu \nin the 1820s. By the 1960s their numbers had \ngrown to approximately 20  000.

However, the \nsuccessful eradication of this pest led to further \nchanges. Each buffalo used to eat an average of 20 \nkilograms of grass each day, so their absence meant \nthe fuel load in Kakadu increased.

This prevented \nwater birds from feeding and reduced local \nbiodiversity.\nManaging Kakadu: a partnership \nwith the Bininj/Mungguy peoples\nSince the 1970s, half of Kakadu has been \nclassified as Aboriginal land under the Aboriginal \nLand Rights Act .

It could no longer \nserve as a habitat for the local magpie goose or \nlong-necked turtle species.\nThe management process involves the yearly \nburning of two types of fires. Low-intensity \nprotective burns occur on the edges of the \nfloodplain in May, which is early in the dry season \nwhen the fuel load is still moist. Higher-intensity \nburns take place throughout the floodplain at the \nend of the dry season in October, when water \nlevels are low and fuel loads are high.\nThe early protective burns prevent these later, \nlarger fires from spreading into the surrounding \nwoodlands. This burning regime continues until \nthe wet season arrives in December.\nFigure 7.64 shows the success of this management \nprogram, which has transformed the region from \na monoculture into a diverse wetland habitat. With the removal of \nthe thick cover of mudja \ngrass, a greater diversity \nof plants can grow in \nits place. Areas of open \nwater also mean that \nwetland birds were able to return to the area to \nfeed.

These \ninclude mining, agriculture, \ncommercial development, \ntourism and overfishing. \nFigure 7.65 shows the \ntopography of the region, \nwith higher elevations further \ninland and river systems that \nflow towards the coast.\nThe shape of this landscape means that inland \npollution will eventually drain into river systems \nand groundwater supplies and discharge into \nthe reef. When the amount of coastal erosion \nis increased due to construction, logging and \nfarming, excessive sediment is added to the river \nsystem. This increases the water\u2019s turbidity.\nAs this sediment flows into the marine \nenvironment, it deprives coral of the sunlight it \nneeds to grow. As mangroves are a natural way of \nfiltering out sediment before it reaches the reefs, \nremoving this component to make way for coastal \ndevelopment is adding to the problem.Untreated waste, like raw sewage and \nagricultural runoff  containing pesticides and \nfertilisers, is also polluting the reef. Adding \nthese nutrients and pollutants into the system \ncauses the excessive growth of macroalgae . This \nalgae competes with \u2013 and can eventually kill \u2013 \ncorals. It also degrades the condition of corals, \nmaking them more susceptible to the effects of \nclimate change.\nEnvironmental change: climate \nchange\nClimate change is expected to impact the \nMesoamerican Reef in a range of ways:\n\u2022 Warming ocean temperatures will cause \nwidespread coral bleaching\n\u2022 Sea level rise will cause increased coastal \nerosion and increase turbidity\n\u2022 The coastline wil l be more vulnerable to strong \nand more frequent storms and subsequent \nflooding\n\u2022 Increased rainfall will increase the runoff of \npollutants\n\u2022 Increased amounts of carbon dioxide absorbed \nby the ocean will lead to ocean acidification, \nwhich will reduce the ability of corals to grow \nand recover from damage.\n\u25b2 Figure  7.67 Roots of mangroves protect the shoreline from storm waves, wind and erosion, and prevent sediment from flowing into the sea\nKEY TERMS\nrunoff  water that flows over the \nsurface of the land rather than \nbeing absorbed\nmacroalgae  large marine algae, \nsuch as seaweed and seagrass, \nthat typically grow in shallow \nwater\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",

It is this algae that gives corals their \ncolour. As can be seen in Figure 7.68, increased \nocean temperatures makes the algae leave the \ncorals tissue, which turns the corals white and \nleaves them without their major food source. This \nis known as coral bleaching .\nAlthough corals can survive bleaching, bleached \ncoral is far more vulnerable to other disturbances \nsuch as pollution or severe storms and far more \nlikely to die as a result. Similarly, corals suffering \nfrom the excessive growth of macroalgae are more \nvulnerable to bleaching.\nThe impacts of coral bleaching are inconsistent \nthroughout the Mesoamerican Reef. Observations \nin 2017 showed that up to 80 per cent of the \ncorals off the coast of Honduras were showing \nsigns of bleaching, whereas corals near Mexico \nwere far less affected.\nCoral bleaching has serious impacts \u2013 it can \nlead to the death of entire ecosystems, severely \naffecting all of the industries and livelihoods that \ndepend on those ecosystems.\nCoastal Management Trust: \ninsuring the reef\nEach year, more than 12 million tourists \nvisit Mexico\u2019s Yucatan Peninsula, generating \nUS$9 billion annually. The region is reliant on \nthe Mesoamerican Reef, both as a major tourist \nattraction and as a buffer that protects the coastline \nfrom hurricanes. Hurricanes are also the biggest \nimmediate threat facing the future of the reef.In order to ensure the \nsustainability of the reef \nand the industries that rely \non it, Nature Conservancy \npartnered with the State \nGovernment of Quintana \nRoo in Mexico to establish \nthe Coastal Management \nTrust scheme in 2018. This \nscheme is an insurance \npolicy. The Trust receives money from the tourism \nindustry and uses it to insure 60 kilometres of the \nreef against damage from hurricanes. The money \nis used to finance the ongoing maintenance of the \nreef in order to improve its health and therefore \nits ability to protect the coastline.\nFollowing any large storms and hurricanes, the \nscheme will fund restoration activities, helping the \nreef to recover so that it can once again protect the \ncoastline. In this way, the trust helps to ensure the \necological conservation of the reef while ensuring \nthe survival of the tourism that relies on it.\nAlthough the trust is currently only applied to \n60 kilometres of coastline near Cancun, it is \nhoped that this model will be applied to other \nregions, and that similar schemes might be \ndeveloped for other ecosystems.\nHealthy Reefs Initiative: assessing \nand monitoring the reef\nAssessing and monitoring the health of an \nenvironment is an essential component of \nenvironmental management. The Healthy Reefs \nInitiative is a collaboration of 48 different non-\ngovernment organisations throughout Central \nAmerica that monitor and evaluate the health of \nthe Mesoamerican Reef.\nFigure 7.69 shows this data organised in a \nGeographic Information System that can be  \nused to explore various data layers and to compare \ndata from different time periods.

Its rapid population growth since \nthe mid-1960s has been the driving force \nbehind its unsustainable land management \n(see Figure 7.73).\nIn addition, China\u2019s thriving agriculture industry \nproduces food for twenty per-cent of the world\u2019s \npopulation. Thirty-five per cent of China\u2019s \nlabour force currently work in agriculture.

When she first moved to a \nsmall village within the Mu Us Desert in Inner \nMongolia, the region was a barren wasteland.\nTo improve her living conditions, Yuzhen started \nplanting trees in 1985. Although only 10 of the \ninitial 600 trees survived, Yuzhen persisted and \nwas eventually successful in keeping more trees \nalive. With the help of her family and villagers \nYuzhen has planted over 600  000 tr ees covering \n4000 hectares.\nYuzhen\u2019s forest has created a protective windbreak \nthat successfully protects her village from \nsandstorms and has \nhalted desertification. \nShe now lives amongst \n100 different species of \ntrees and shrubs that \nsupport populations of \nwild roosters, rabbits \nand foxes. Her local \nvillage is also thriving \neconomically, earning money from agriculture, \nhoney production and as a tourist attraction.\nYuzhen has won over 60 awards locally and \ninternationally. Many people have benefitted \nfrom her expertise in forest management and \nsustainable agriculture within dryland regions.The Great Green Wall: a national \nresponse\nSince 1978 China has been planting billions of \ntrees along its northern and northwestern regions \nas part of the Three-North Shelterbelt Project, \nmore commonly known as the Great Green Wall. \nIt is hoped that this large-scale afforestation  \nwill protect the country from desertification \nby creating a 4500-kilometre protective buffer \nbetween desert and farmland.\nA project of this scale is also globally significant, \nhaving the potential to increase the world\u2019s forest \ncover by 10 per cent. To date more than 66 billion \ntrees have been planted, with planting set to \ncontinue until 2050.\nThe success of this response is currently mixed. \nSince the program began, tree cover in China\u2019s \nnorth has increased from five to twelve per cent. \nA study from NASA using satellite imagery has \ndetermined that the global green leaf area  has \nincreased by five per cent since the start of the \ntwenty-first century. At least 25 per cent of this \nincrease has occurred in China. Figure 7.76 shows \nthe regions of China that have had the largest \ngrowth. However, 32 per cent of this increase in \nvegetation is due to intensive agriculture, which \nin turn is contributing to desertification through \novercultivation.\nSome regions in China have shown a reduction \nin the rate of desertification. Some areas, such as \nthe Loess Plateau, have been incredibly successful, \nshowing a 20 per cent increase in forest cover. \nHowever, many regions have not managed to \nhalt the advancement of the desert \u2013 overall \nthe impacts of desertification have not yet been \nreversed.\nOne of the major criticisms of the project is \nthat young trees need lots of water to grow and \nthat there is insufficient water to sustain them \nin dryland regions. In some cases these trees \nare actually contributing to desertification by \nabsorbing additional water from dwindling \ngroundwater supplies. Tree growth has also been \nslower than expected and many trees have died \nfrom disease or due to a lack of water. Studies \nhave shown that only 15 per cent of the trees \nplanted since 1978 have survived.\n\u25b2 Figure  7.75 Huaying, Sichuan, China: rocky desertification \ncontrolKEY TERMS\nafforestation  planting \nvegetation in an area to establish \na forest\nglobal green leaf area  \nmeasure of vegetation coverage \nthat includes forests, plantations \nand agriculture\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",

In these same regions, the number of overweight children is \nalso growing significantly!\nAs well as contrasts in the amount of food people consume, there is wide variation in the amount of things \npeople own.

Human wellbeing varies significantly depending on the place and population for which wellbeing is measured.\nIn the world\u2019s poorest regions, wellbeing involves having the basic requirements needed for survival, such as food and clean water, shelter, clothing and safety. In wealthier regions, health, income, education and happiness are more common measures of wellbeing.\nIn many cases, individuals \nmake decisions about what they consider to be the qualities of a prosperous life and then measure their level of wellbeing based on whether or not they have the ability and resources available to them to achieve those qualities in their own lives.\nThe study of human \nwellbeing can be approached on many different scales. On a global scale, the wellbeing of different countries can be compared. Trends in the global distribution of wellbeing can be used to measure the change in the development of different countries and regions.On a national scale, there is often a stark contrast between the wellbeing of different parts of a country\u2019s population, particularly between rural and urban regions. These contrasts can present difficult management challenges for national governments.\nOn a local scale, the wellbeing of people within a \nplace can vary based on a variety of factors such as employment, wealth, housing and education.\nHow is human wellbeing \nmeasured?\nThere is no single measure of human wellbeing. \nInstead, comparing the wellbeing of populations involves using a variety of indicators. When combined, these indicators give an overall view of a population\u2019s wellbeing.\nSome of these indicators, such as infant \nmortality rate (IMR), are objective and quantitative. This means that they can be measured, making them easy to compare. Other indicators, such as happiness, are qualitative and more difficult to measure.\nQualitative results are often based on interviews \nand surveys \u2013 these results can be subjective, which means they are influenced by a person\u2019s environment, experiences and preferences. Qualitative data is therefore not always consistent. Many of the most common indicators used to measure human wellbeing are outlined in the rest of this chapter.\nSanitation\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), sanitation refers to the provision of facilities and services for the safe management and movement of human excreta from a toilet to storage, treatment and safe use or disposal.

Wealth provides access to life\u2019s \nnecessities and opportunities, and affects all other \nwellbeing indicators. For example, regions with \ngreater wealth have a greater access to sanitation, \nhigher levels of education and a higher life \nexpectancy.\nA common way of measuring and comparing \nwealth between countries is Gross Domestic \nProduct (GDP) per capita. GDP is a measure of \na country\u2019s economic output based on the total \nvalue of goods produced and services provided \nin a year. \u2018Per capita\u2019 means \nper person. GDP per capita \nis a measure of a country\u2019s \nwealth divided by its total \npopulation.\nWhen considering an \nindividual\u2019s wellbeing \nbased on their wealth, it is \nimportant to differentiate \nbetween absolute and \nrelative wealth. Absolute \nwealth  refers to wealth \ncompared to a fixed \nstandard, for example, whether a person is \nabove or below the national poverty level. On \nthe other hand, relative wealth  relates to how a person\u2019s wealth compares with the other people \naround them, including their family and friends, \ncolleagues and the people living within their \nsuburb or region.\nAnother consideration when looking at wealth \nis the cost of living  within a place, compared \nwith the average income. Table 8.2 shows that \nthe average annual income in Switzerland is \nUS$81  130, making its population rich by global \nstandards.

They show the relationship between two different variables. The dependent \nvariable goes on the y-axis (vertical axis). A dependent variable is a value that can be calculated based on the value of an independent variable. The independent \nvariable goes on the x-axis (horizontal axis) of a scatter graph.\nIn Figure 8.17, IMR is the independent variable and TFR is the dependent variable. \nThe data points represent values from different countries. Using this graph, it can be shown that increases in IMR are related to increases in the TFR.\nThe relationship between variables is known as a correlation. When increases in an \nindependent variable are related to increases in a dependent variable, the direction of \nthis correlation is said to be positive. When increases in an independent variable are related to decreases in the dependent variable, the direction of this correlation is said to be negative.\nThe strength of a correlation is determined by how closely aligned the data points are. \nThis is demonstrated in Figure 8.19. Always ensure that you do not use the word \u2018cause\u2019 when describing the relationship between variables. This is because a correlation does not necessarily mean that one variable causes changes in another one \u2013 there are often additional factors to consider. For example, although an increase in IMR might be the cause of an increase in TFR within a country, there could be additional reasons, such as the cost of contraception or the availability of education.\nKEY TERMS\nvariable characteristic, factor \nor quantity that increases or decreases over time\ndependent variable variable \nwhose is thought to depend on the value of an independent variable\nindependent variable variable \nwhose changes in value are not thought to be determined by other values under consideration\ncorrelation relationship \nbetween variables \u2013 for example if one variable increases when another variable increases, there is a correlation between those two variables\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",

In this context, \u2018space\u2019 \nrefers to spatial location and \u2018distribution\u2019 refers to \nthe way things are arranged. By analysing the spatial \ndistribution of phenomena, geographers are able to \nfind patterns. For example, Figure 8.21 (B) shows \nthat Europe contains a large cluster of countries \nwith the lowest infant mortality rate (IMR) in \nthe world.\nGeographers can also quantify these patterns \nby estimating the percentage coverage. \nFigure 8.21 (C) shows that approximately \n20 per cent of sub-Saharan Africa has a total \nfertility rate (TFR) of above four.\nFinally, geographers can also find exceptions to \nexisting patterns. An example of an exception is a place that doesn\u2019t have the same qualities as the \nplaces surrounding it, and therefore doesn\u2019t fit \nthe pattern. When looking at the distribution of \nwealth, Saudi Arabia is an exception because it \nhas a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita \nof US$40  000\u201350  000, which is much higher than \nthat of the countries that surround it.\nWhile understanding the distribution of a \nphenomenon is an important first step, this \nunderstanding often needs to be followed by \nan analysis of the reasons for that distribution. \nFor example, why does Niger have such a high \nTFR?

In a similar way, we can look at the \nlink between variables or phenomena using \ndistribution maps.Spatial association  refers to the degree to which \nthe distribution of two phenomena is similar. As with \nscatter graphs, you must be careful not to make too \nmany assumptions. For example, Figure 8.21 A\u2013E  \ndemonstrates that there is a strong spatial \nassociation, between TFR and ALR. However, we \ncannot simply state that a high level of education \ncauses women to have fewer children because there \nmight be other factors that have contributed to this \nassociation, such as social pressures, access to health \ncare and the cost of living.\nDEVELOPING GEOGRAPHICAL CONCEPTS AND SKILLS 8.4\nDescribing the spatial association between two phenomena\nDescribing the spatial association between two phenomena or variables is an important part of \nunderstanding the relationship between them. It involves looking at two maps with the same scale and \nanalysing how similar or different their distributions are.\nA strong spatial association between two phenomena would mean that their distributions are very similar, \nfor example if areas that have a high amount of something in one map also have a high amount of something \nelse in the other map. A moderate spatial association between two phenomena would exist if some regions \nof the map have a similar distribution and other regions of the map do not. A weak spatial association \nbetween two phenomena would exist if the two maps do not appear to have many regions that correlate.\nThere are two important things to include when describing a spatial association:\n1) A clear statement of the strength of the spatial association (for example, \u2018There is a strong/moderate/\nweak spatial association between \u2026 and \u2026\u2019)\n2) Several examples of evidence to back up your statement. This should include examples from both high \nand low ends of the spectrum.\nThe evidence that you choose will depend on the strength of the association.

It can also reveal trends over \ntime. By comparing the distribution of current \ndata with past data, trends can be identified.\nLooking at Figure 8.22, the total fertility rate \n(TFR) in 1950 was high in South America, all \nof Africa, the Middle East, and most of Asia. \nChina had one of the highest TFRs in Asia \u2013 \nbetween six and seven. By 1980 China\u2019s TFR \nhad dropped significantly to between two and \nthree, even though much of the TFR in other Asian countries stayed relatively high. This is \nbecause China introduced its One Child Policy \nin 1979, which legally restricted parents to have \nonly one child. This policy was specifically aimed \nto slow China\u2019s population growth in order to \nprevent an economic collapse and widespread \nfamine.\nWhen combining the data from Figure 8.22 with \nthe graph in Figure 8.23, it is clear that the One \nChild Policy was successful in reducing the TFR. \nHowever, this trend demonstrates the complexity \ninvolved in measuring human wellbeing: the \npolicy successfully reduced the TFR but it also led \nto a range of economic and social consequences \nfor its population.\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",

Developed countries  are more \nindustrialised  and have a stronger economy than \ndeveloping countries .\nCountries are generally considered to be developed \nif they have a gross domestic product (GDP) \nper capita of above US$12  000, although many \ndeveloped countries have \na GDP per capita closer \nto US$40  000 or mor e. \nDeveloped countries also \ngenerally have a higher \nstandard of living and \ngreater access to medical \ncare and technology. \nDeveloped countries rate \nhigher than developing \ncountries in most \nwellbeing indicators. \nThey also rank higher \nin the UN Human Development Index. In combination, these factors \noften lead to developed countries having a stable or \ndecreasing population (see Figure 8.25).\nDeveloping countries are defined as having \na low GDP per capita and a low level of \nindustrialisation. They generally rank low \nin indicators such as adult literacy, access to \nsanitation and life expectancy. They also often \nhave high levels of unemployment, widespread \npoverty, poor living conditions, a less safe \nenvironment to live in, and rapidly growing \npopulations.\nLess economically developed countries are a \nsubcategory of developing countries.

In 2018, the 26 richest \npeople owned the same amount of money as the \npoorest 3.8 billion people \u2013 that\u2019s approximately \nhalf of the global population! Figure 8.28 shows \nthat the richest one per cent of people own nearly \nhalf of the world\u2019s wealth.\nThis one per cent of the world\u2019s population is \nall of the people in the world who own more \nthan US$1 million worth of assets. In 2019, \n1.18 million Australians were in this category.\nThe distribution of the world\u2019s millionaires is also \nuneven and disproportional to population size. \nFigure 8.28 shows that 41 per cent of the world\u2019s \nmillionaires are found in the United States, while \na total of 65 per cent of the world\u2019s millionaires are found in Europe and North America \ncombined.\nAccording to the United Nations, the \nproportion of the global population living in \ndeveloped countries is declining, and will be \nonly 15 per cent in 2030. This is because the \npopulation of many developed countries is \nstable or shrinking as many more people choose \nto have less children.\nIn developing countries, particularly the least \ndeveloped countries, the total fertility rate (TFR) \nis still very high, causing rapid population growth. \nThis inequality between countries is fundamental \nto their levels of wellbeing.

Economically developed \ncountries with a high level of wellbeing generally \nhave a low TFR and a high life expectancy. This \nleads to a stable or decreasing population.\nGermany\u2019s population is stable and slowly \ndecreasing. Its growth rate was -0.16 per cent in \n2018. Germany\u2019s growth is negative because it \nhas a TFR of just 1.50 children per woman. This \nis far below the replacement rate  of 2.1, which \nis the amount of children a woman needs to have \nto keep the population \nstable. However, Germany\u2019s \npopulation isn\u2019t shrinking \nrapidly because it has a large \nannual migrant intake.\nFigure 8.30 shows that \nGermany\u2019s population \nstructure is very top-heavy \nand tapering inwards at the \nbottom. This indicates a \nhigh life expectancy and a \nlow TFR. This means that, \nwithin a decade, Germany is \nlikely to have an increasingly \nlarge dependent elderly \npopulation and a reducing \nnumber of workers. This \nstructure is also known as an \nageing population .\nAlthough an ageing \npopulation can have \npositives, such as low levels \nof unemployment and a prosperous lifestyle for many residents, it does \ncreate difficulties in managing the economy and \nensuring the wellbeing of older residents. In many \ncases, elderly people require some form of social \nsecurity , access to medical treatment and the \nopportunity to maintain an active social life.\nOn the other hand, less economically developed \ncountries with a low level of wellbeing, \nsuch as Niger, often have a high TFR and \na low life expectancy.

While this has a very positive \neconomic impact on the emigrants\u2019 countries of \norigin, it often has a negative economic impact on the country they have migrated to. For example, \na country\u2019s local economy does not benefit \nfrom the earnings that are sent to emigrant\u2019s \nhome countries, while the unemployment rate \nof nationals  can rise due to emigrants being \nemployed in the place of locals.\nThis situation has occurred in Saudi Arabia, \nwhere approximately one-third of its population \nare immigrant  workers from places like India \nand Bangladesh.

This variation \nis often measured by region. Geographers use \nregions as a way of \ndividing an area into \nsmaller areas that differ \nin their characteristics. \nSometimes these \ndivisions seem to be \narbitrary, such as the \ndivisions between the \nstates and territories of \nAustralia.\nRegions can be divided \nfurther into subregions. \nFor example, Victoria \nis divided into subregions including Gippsland, \nHume, the Central Highlands and Metropolitan \nMelbourne. Metropolitan Melbourne can be \nbroken down further into different suburbs (for \nexample, Collingwood, Southbank, Frankston or \nLower Plenty).\nDifferences in wellbeing within a country are \noften referred to as inequality. This means some \ncitizens of a country have a higher level of \nwellbeing than other people in the same country.\nA common comparison between regions is \ngross domestic product (GDP) per capita or \naverage income. Other measures include things \nlike unemployment levels, safety, air quality and \ninternet speeds. Mexico, for example, has a very \nhigh variation in homicide rates, ranging from \n2.4 murders per 100  000 people in Yucatan on \nthe eastern peninsula, to almost 65 per 100  000 \nin Guerrero on the Pacific coast. The following provides two examples of very different countries \nthat both have large variations in various aspects \nof human wellbeing.\nRegional inequality in Italy\nItaly is a developed country located in Europe. It \nis a member of the Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development (OECD) , \nalong with 35 other economically developed and \nemerging countries.\nPeople who live in Italy generally have a high \nlevel of health and associated high life expectancy. \nThey have a moderate level of household wealth, \nbut a low level of education, environmental \nquality and life satisfaction. (In early 2020, \nItaly was one of the worst hit countries of \nthe coronavirus pandemic due to its ageing \npopulation in densely populated areas especially \nin the northern regions.)\nOne of Italy\u2019s main concerns is inequality between \nits regions. There is regional disparity  between \nthe northern and southern regions of Italy. The \nnorthern regions have a much higher level of \nwellbeing than the southern regions. This is based \non differences in economic growth, job availability, \naccess to health care, education levels, government \ninvestment, security and infrastructure.\nThe divide between the northern and southern \nregions in Italy is so large that, based on statistics, \nit is as if these regions are located in completely \ndifferent countries.\nFor example, the GDP per capita in the northern \nprovince of Bolzano-Bozen in the Trentino-Alto \nAdige region is similar to Austria, which is ranked \n13th-highest in the world.

Despite only having a GDP per capita of \napproximately US$2500 in 2018, Vietnamese \npeople are above average in their ability to convert \nwealth to wellbeing. This means Vietnam ranks as \nhighly in wellbeing indicators as many countries \nwith twice its wealth.\nSince the 1986 economic reforms known as \nthe Doi Moi, Vietnam has seen high economic \ngrowth rates, one of the greatest reductions in \npoverty in the world and vast improvements in \nliving standards. However, this growth has also \nwidened the gap between rich and poor people. \nThis gap is particularly prevalent when comparing \nrelatively wealthy urban regions with surrounding \npoorer rural areas.\nWhile Vietnam\u2019s economy was once dominated \nby agriculture, recent government expenditure and foreign investment in its urban areas have led to \na transition towards manufacturing and services \nindustries.\nHowever, while Vietnam\u2019s urban regions have \nbecome growth centres, rural regions are still \ndominated by the agricultural industry, which has \nshown only minor economic growth.

Scabies  is a treatable skin \ninfection that spreads from person to person. \nIt is widespread throughout remote Aboriginal \ncommunities, but rare throughout the rest of \nAustralia.\nWithin Aboriginal communities, studies have \nshown that up to 70 per cent of children are \ninfected with scabies within the first year of their \nlife. This is the third highest rate of infection in \nthe world. If left untreated, this infection can lead \nto kidney disease and heart conditions, or develop \ninto a more severe form of infection known as \ncrusted scabies.\nIt is estimated that up to one per cent of all \nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples \nliving in remote communities have crusted \nscabies. Without adequate treatment, half of \nall people who develop crusted scabies die within \nfive years.There are several factors \nthat contribute to the \nseverity and prevalence of \nscabies and other diseases \nwithin these communities. \nThis includes overcrowded \nhousing, and the sharing of \nbeds, clothes and towels.\nWithin the Katherine \nregion, approximately one \nin four Aboriginal people are homeless due to \nthe high price of rental houses and the lack of \npublic housing . This rate of homelessness is \nover 30 times the Australian average. People in \nKatherine who live in houses are often living \nwith three or four generations (children, parents, \ngrandparents and great-grandparents) under \nthe same roof in very crowded conditions (see \nFigure 8.57). This allows infections like scabies to \nquickly pass between family members.\nFurthermore, even when a scabies infection \nis treated, there is a high rate of reinfection \nunless the patient\u2019s living conditions can also be \nimproved.\nACTIVITY 8.20\nAnalysing geographical data\n1 Compare the population pyramids for Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander peoples and non-Indigenous \nAustralians using Figure 8.54.

These initiatives contain goals relating to \nthe aspects of wellbeing that they are aiming to \nimprove. They often contain specific targets that \nmust be reached in order to achieve these goals.\nIn some cases an organisation might focus \nprimarily on one form of wellbeing, such \nas improving literacy. However, due to the \ninterconnection between factors that determine \nwellbeing, many of these initiatives aim to \nimprove wellbeing in several different areas.\nA government organisation is an organisation \nthat is part of (or has links with) a government \ndepartment. For example, the Australian \nGovernment\u2019s Department of Social Services \nmanages national \npolicies  that aim to \ncreate an equitable \nsociety in areas such \nas rent assistance, \nhomelessness and the \nNational Disability \nInsurance Scheme. At a \nstate level, the Victorian \nWorkCover Authority \nconducts targeted visits \nto workplaces to ensure \nthe health and safety of \nemployees.\nIntergovernmental \norganisations involve \nthe cooperation of \ngovernments from \nseveral member \ncountries that are usually bound by a treaty . They work \ntowards common goals involving issues on an \ninternational scale. The United Nations  (UN) \nwas formed after World War II with the aim \nof preventing future wars. It works to uphold \ninternational law, deliver humanitarian aid  and \nprotect human rights.\nA non-government organisation (NGO) is \na not-for-profit  group that is not part of a \ngovernment department. NGOs can exist at \nlocal, national or even international scales. They \nare generally funded by grants, memberships, \nprivate donations, and the sale of goods and \nservices.\nOxfam is an international NGO focusing on \nthe alleviation of poverty around the world. The \nAustralian Red Cross is a national example of \nan NGO operating within Australia. It provides \ninternational aid across the Asia-Pacific region, \nsupporting communities that have experienced \ndisasters, managing and provide blood donations. \nIt also provides support for vulnerable people \nsuch as the elderly, people with disabilities, and \nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.\nHow do you measure the \neffectiveness of a management \ninitiative?\nGeographers use data to monitor and assess \nwellbeing. This data can be measured against \nspecific targets to see whether or not those \ntarges have been met. This is one way to measure \nthe effectiveness of wellbeing management \ninitiatives. In other words: has wellbeing actually \nimproved, or have there been any further \nconsequences?\nThe following five case studies provide examples \nof a variety of wellbeing management initiatives \nat a range of scales.8.5 Improving human wellbeing\nFOCUS QUESTION\nHow do government and non-government organisations seek to improve human wellbeing?\nKEY TERMS\npolicy  course of action proposed \nand carried out by a governing \nbody\ntreaty  written agreement \nbetween two or more political \nauthorities bound by international \nlaw\nUnited Nations (UN)  \ninternational organisation, made \nup of over 150 countries, that \nseeks to maintain peace between \nnations\nhumanitarian aid  short-term \nassistance to people who need \nhelp recovering from natural or \nman-made disasters\nnot-for-profit organisation  \norganisation that does not \noperate for the profit or personal \ngain of its members\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",

It also had to be able to operate \n\u2018off the grid\u2019 without a connection to a water \nsupply, sewerage system or an electricity grid, at \nthe same time as remaining affordable.\nSeveral toilets have been designed to meet these \ncriteria, using localised chemical treatment rather \nthan expensive sewerage infrastructure.

These young men are trained as \nbuilders and provided with work refurbishing \nand building homes and infrastructure within \nthe town. This work provides a boost to their \nincome while tackling many of the other \nsocial problems in the region, such as drug and \nalcohol abuse.\nOn a national scale, in 2005 the Australian \nGovernment has established a strategy called \n\u25b2 Figure 8.63  Members of Binjari\u2019 s building program\nClosing the Gap. The aim of this strategy is \nto achieve equality for Aboriginal and Torres \nStrait Islander peoples in health, life expectancy, \neducation and employment.\nVarious targets have been set, with the overall \ngoal of reducing disadvantage among Aboriginal \nand Torres Strait Islander peoples by 2030. \nImprovements are monitored each year by the \nCouncil of Australian Governments. Unfortunately, \nas of 2018, only half of the targets listed in \nFigure 8.64 are on track. Many have not been \nachieved by their intended year of achievement. \nIn 2019 the Close the Gap report admitted that \nit was of great concern that the gap in the life \nexpectancy was widening rather than closing (see \nFigure 8.65).\nFurthermore, school attendances rates for \nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have \nonly increased by less than one per cent in most \nstates and territories. Fortunately, the percentage \nof Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students \nwho do attend school and go on to finish Year  12 is \nincreasing steadily, so that particular gap is closing.\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",

While they are different terms, they have \nmany shared characteristics. Both involve creativity and an open mind. It is important to be able \nto sell creative ideas and to be able to tell a story about an innovation or new business idea in a \nway that captures the imagination of investors. To be an entrepreneur or an innovator you need to \nbe flexible enough to change. Today\u2019s successful product range is tomorrow\u2019s failure. If you see an \nopportunity, follow it.\nWilliam Wrigley Jr. was a famous entrepreneur. \nHe started the Wrigley\u2019s Chewing Gum business \nin the late 1800s. He started off in sales, selling \nbaking powder door-to-door. Thinking like an \nentrepreneur, he had the idea of giving away a free \nproduct with each door-to-door sale of baking \npowder, in the hope of making his products more \nattractive to buyers.\nWrigley decided to offer chewing gum with \neach sale of baking powder. After a while he found that the gum was more popular than \nthe baking powder. Thinking like any good \nentrepreneur, he switched his business from \nselling baking powder to chewing gum. He \nestablished Wrigley\u2019s Gum, which grew into \none of the biggest chewing gum brands in \nthe world.\nIn the early 1900s Wrigley launched a number of \nchewing gum flavours that are still with us today, \nincluding Juicy Fruit and PK.\n\u25b2 Figure  9.1 Classic coated chewing gum pellets\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",

Logos are used by companies because \nthey present a concise image of the company. \nPeople generally find it easier to remember a \nsimple image over words alone. Our eyes are \ndrawn to visual objects \u2013 well-designed logos add visual appeal to a business. Graphics can add \ninterest and meaning to a logo.

A target market is the group of customers \nto which the business intends to sell its products. \nChoosing a target market is important \u2013 that way \na business can direct its marketing strategies to \nthat group of customers, rather than the whole \nmarket.

This lets a business direct their \nmarketing towards the needs of a smaller, more \nspecific part of the total market.\nAs part of recognising and knowing their target \nmarket, a business will also divide the consumer \nmarket up according to four key traits, or \ncommonalities.

Writers, artists and audiences have long wondered what roles autonomous machines could play in shaping our societies. Some imagine fantastic worlds where clanking metal robots would do the jobs we no longer wanted to do (after all, the word \u2018robot\u2019 comes from the Czech word \u2018robotnik\u2019, which means \u2018slave\u2019), freeing us up for leisure, thought and invention \u2013 basically allowing humans a freer and fuller life. Others tell stories of chaotic futures in which robots become too smart, too advanced, and render the human worker, or even humanity itself, redundant, leading to devastating consequences.\nIn German film director Fritz \nLang\u2019s classic 1927 film Metropolis, a futuristic city is controlled by the rich. The poor human workers are kept underground to operate the vast machines that create a utopia (a place of ideal perfection) for the rich citizens. As the workers begin to rebel against the rich, a female robot, known as False Maria, is created by a scientist to unite the workers and lead the revolution. However, the failings of this mechanical messiah are soon apparent, and a disastrous flooding of the underworld leads the workers to turn on False Maria, burning the metal creation at the stake. Much like the monster in Mary Shelley\u2019s seminal novel Frankenstein, False Maria could never truly belong in the human world. In fact, Shelley\u2019s monster was quite like a robot itself.\nFor early sci-fi storytellers, and to \nsome degree scientists, the great failing of artificially intelligent robots would be their inability to understand emotion and the nuances of human life. They would be able to perform basic functions, but they could never achieve the complexity of the human brain, heart or soul. Yet developments in computing, science and technology through the 1950s and 1960s have expanded our imagination \n\u25b2 Figure 10.1  Film poster for the German science fiction film Metropolis  from 1927 \nshowing the robot False Maria\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 440": "in terms of what is possible. If humans could \nland on the moon and create weapons of colossal destruction, what limit could there be on the capacity of a robot? Could it be a friend? \nThe 1977 classic science fiction film Star Wars \nintroduced the world to the polite but socially awkward translator robot C-3PO and his more amenable offsider R2-D2. Fluent in six million languages, the shimmering gold of C-3PO\u2019s replicated human form was designed to provide a butler-like service to humans. While R2-D2 didn\u2019t have these more advanced abilities, and in fact didn\u2019t speak human languages at all, it demonstrated better communication skills, original thinking and the ability to act intelligently at critical times. These robots in no way replaced the powers of the human characters, who pursued the cause of good in the face of great evil, but the robots did assist them in their quest. The idea that robots could think for themselves, independent from human control, was (and remains) an exciting, but also terrifying, concept to many people. What if these robots broke down? Or worse, purposely malfunctioned? Michael Crichton\u2019s 1973 film Westworld (which was also the basis for the recent TV series of the same name) imagined a theme park made to resemble the old American West where humans could dress up and harmlessly interact with robots in bar fights, gun duels and other simulated adventures. All seems well until the robots not only malfunction but turn on the humans with murderous intent. Was Westworld a warning that humans could not trust their own creations?\nThis same idea was explored with a \ndeeper sense of doom in 1979\u2019s space horror Alien, in which the crew of an ordinary space ship are pursued by a rogue alien intent on killing everything in its path. The lone robot (or android) in the crew, Ash, begins to mastermind the downfall of the crew in favour of the economic value the alien specimen will provide the ship\u2019s owners. In Alien, not only did \nthe robot turn on human workers, it did so with cold, calculated manipulation to generate profit. This demonstrated how dangerous the intent of robots\u2019 creators, and also of robotic interpretation, could be. \nThe Terminator series of movies similarly explores \nthe potential perils of artificially intelligent life. The company Skynet creates a \u2018Global Digital Defense Network\u2019 system that becomes conscious. The system quickly decides that humanity itself is a threat to its existence and formulates a plan to wipe out humans by initiating nuclear war, creating their own autonomous machines to wipe out any remaining humans who survive.\nBut there are also more positive representations \nof robot futures in contemporary culture. For instance, the animated film Big Hero 6 features a friendly healthcare robot called Baymax that \n\u25b2 Figure 10.2  Droid sidekicks R2-D2 and C-3PO from the Star Wars films\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",

The Second \nIndustrial Revolution, which took place between the \nlate 1800s and the early 1900s, saw electric power \nbegin to be used in production. The Third Industrial \nRevolution, which took place around the 1960s \nand 1970s, was about the use of technology and \nelectronics to automate production.\nWe are now experiencing the Fourth Industrial \nRevolution. This particular revolution is seen as \nan extension of the third. It involves a fusion of \ntechnologies and differs from the Third Industrial \nRevolution in its speed and the scope of the \nchanges it is creating.\nThe speed of the current changes in industry is \nexponential, rather than linear. This means that it is getting faster and faster, rather than continuing \nat a steady pace. These changes are impacting \non\u00a0every work type, in almost every industry, in \nevery\u00a0economy.\nThe Fourth Industrial Revolution is epitomised by \nhigh-use personal technology.

These skills, yet to be replicated in \nthe domain of technology, are skills that can be \nleveraged for income.\nHumans, unlike robots, are social and emotional \nbeings. The jobs that require lots of emotional \nintelligence will be the jobs that people can \nrely upon. These kinds of jobs include nursing, \npsychology, childcare work and education. All of \nthese jobs involve people interacting with other \npeople, therefore they cannot be replaced by\u00a0robots.These jobs belong to \nthe caring economy , a \nsector of the economy \nin which machines do \nnot perform well, but \nmost people perform \nbrilliantly. Growth in \nemployment in the \ncaring economy is strong, with high demand \nfor jobs in areas such as aged care, healthcare, \nchildcare and education. The problem is, \ncompared to some other sectors of the economy, \njobs in the caring economy are not well\u00a0paid.\nNonetheless, it is important to remember that \nthe future is ours. The possibilities that lie beyond \nschool and the society we develop will depend \non the value we place on the caring economy. \nWe need to recognise the value in education and \naged care and pay accordingly.

To be able to \nwork across a number of \nareas is even more desirable. Some examples of \nwork areas that are growing now and into the \nfuture include robotics and social media.\nRobotics\nAccording to Builtin.com, a tech company with \noffices around the world, robotics is an intersection \nof science, engineering and technology that \nproduces machines (called robots) that can \nsubstitute for (or replicate) human actions.\nRobots have long been a part of our pop culture. \nThese kinds of robots have many overly exaggerated \nhuman characteristics that give them a personality. \nHowever, this is not a realistic expectation of what \nrobotics means for the workplace of the future. \nWhile robots have many human-like features, \nincluding voices, they do not possess a natural \nintelligence or an ability to think. Nonetheless, they \ndo have an enormous capacity to solve problems.\nRobotics can be useful in a variety of workplaces, \nfrom completing repetitive work on assembly \nlines to teaching foreign languages. Examples of \nartificial intelligence in the field of robotics are \nplentiful. The development of skills in this area has \nled to successful innovation in the production of \nnew goods and services that use AI and robotics.\nExamples of robotics being used in the workplace \ncan be as broad as a virtual office or a home assistant to a financial robo-advisor that uses AI \nand algorithms  to scan share market data and \nmake predictions on the best-performing shares or \nportfolios.\nSocial media\nHave you ever met a social media influencer? The \nsocial media industry has boomed in recent years. \nMany people are using the power of social media \nand technology to create new opportunities and \nearn an income.\nAccording to the Influencer Marketing Hub, a social \nmedia influencer is an individual who has the power \nto influence the purchasing decisions of other people \nin certain markets. Social media influencers can be \ncelebrities, industry experts or well-known bloggers. \nIt is the size of their following on social media \nplatforms, as well as their engagement with their \naudience, that determines a social media influencer\u2019s \nsuccess and their ability to make money from this \nkind of venture.\nUsing new technology, social media influencers \nhave created a new industry and made money \nfrom product promotion and sponsored posts, \nwhich they use to promote products in return for \npayment. Influencers can also make money by \nbecoming product ambassadors and agreeing to \npromote one particular brand on their social media \nposts. In return, the influencer will receive free \nproducts or will payment for each promotion they \ncreate on social media.\nSocial media influencers have embraced new \ntechnology and used it to reach out to a potential \nmarket of more than a billion people worldwide \nacross platforms like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook \nand Snapchat.

It is a system in which \nobjects with computing devices within them are able to use the internet to connect to each other \nand exchange data. \nImagine that you are travelling in a car when a \nwarning light on the dashboard comes on. You don\u2019t \nnotice it. Luckily, the car\u2019s computer can use the \nIoT to alert the car manufacturer of the particular \nfault \u2013 whether it is a critical engine failure or a tyre \nthat is losing pressure. This can then be logged by \nthe manufacturer and the driver can be contacted \non their mobile to head to the closest repair shop, \nthe coordinates of which can be sent to their \nphone as GPS data. While they drive carefully \nto this repair shop, the manufacturer\u2019s database is \nsearching for available parts that they can be loaded \ninto a delivery van and sent to the repairer. The IoT \nwill have you back on the road in no time.\nWhat about a pair of sneakers that analyse data \nfrom each run to not only provide fitness and \nposture data, but also determine the optimal time \nwhen they should be replaced? Or a fridge that can \ndetect milk and butter levels and make a delivery \norder on your behalf? Or a house that detects your \ntravel data to turn on heaters, outside lights and \nunlock doors moments ahead of your arrival?\nThe interconnection of devices and technologies \nthat create the IoT is known as \u2018convergence\u2019. \nConvergence allows a range of physical devices \nto come together to make more efficient \ntechnologies that no longer need human \ninteraction to operate. The IoT can think and \ncommunicate on its own. \nMovies can tell us a lot about the possibilities and \ndangers of IoT. As early as 1968, film director \nStanley Kubrick imagined a computer that was \n\u25b2 Figure  11.1 A doorbell from the company Ring that connects to \nthe internet to provide security videos and also connects to other \nsecurity fixtures around the house\nsmart enough to authenticate by voice, understand \nspeech, and interpret emotions in his film 2001: \nA Space Odyssey . At the time this technology was \npurely imaginative. Today, however, our phones \ncan recognise our faces and fingerprints to \nauthenticate our identity. \nThe 2002 film Minority Report  predicted these \ntechnological developments and potential further \nevolutions of their use. In the futuristic world of \nthe story, police use facial recognition and complex \ndatabases to not only identify criminals but predict \nwhen and how they will commit crimes. The film\u2019s \ndirector, Steven Spielberg, went even further by \nsuggesting that an individual\u2019s eye could be used \nto detect identity and then the IoT could employ \nbehavioural data to personalise the advertising that \nwould be directed towards that individual. \nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",

In a system known as \u2018social credit\u2019, \ngovernment monitors use facial recognition and \na vast network of connected data to observe the \nbehaviour of individuals and provide \u2018credit\u2019 to \nthose who demonstrate what the government \nconsiders are good behaviours, but more \nimportantly, to identify and penalise those who \ndon\u2019t.

Involving these capabilities into \nyour business context is necessary if you want to be \ncompetitive and a leader in your field.\nEvery day, businesses are working out new ways to \nuse these techniques and technologies to improve \nproductivity, reduce costs and improve market share.\nVirtual office assistants\nOne of the key areas in which AI and machine \nlearning capabilities can enhance automation is in \nthe areas of virtual office assistants and chatbots.\nNearly all businesses today use virtual office \nassistants. They are vital in keeping a business \noperating, whether it is by automatically turning \nthe office lights on and off, answering calls, \nor transferring calls. In today\u2019s competitive \nenvironment these jobs need to be done almost  \n24 hours a day, seven days a week.\nTechnology has developed sufficient capacity to \nreplace people in the performing of such simple, \nrepetitive tasks using intelligent virtual assistants \n(IVA) or intelligent personal assistants (IPA). \nExamples of these virtual assistants are Apple\u2019s \nSiri and Amazon\u2019s Alexa.\nSometimes IVAs are known as \u2018chatbots\u2019. A \nchatbot (sometimes known as a \u2018chatterbot\u2019) is \nsimply a machine that uses or simulates human conversation through \nspeech or text.

They \ncan also be used to help people with disabilities to \ntalk and communicate.\nThe usual problems that machines present can still \nexist in such technology, however. Typical issues \ninclude lack of tone, lack of emotion and cultural \ninsensitivity. Tone and emotion are important \ninterpersonal elements of communication. \nCommunication without appropriate tone or \nemotions can have a negative impact on the \nrecipients of messages.\nAutonomous cars and drones\nMore than 40 cities around the world operate \ndriverless trains of some kind. The next step in \nautonomous transport will be autonomous vehicles. \nUnlike trains, however, which travel on a fixed line, \nautonomous vehicles must meet the challenges \nassociated with road use (and other road users).\nAutonomous vehicles, also known as driverless \nvehicles, need to be able to respond to traffic \nlights, give way signs and pedestrians (including \nchildren). How is AI dealing with these \nchallenges? Are people willing to accept the risks?\nMany people argue that driverless vehicles could \nin fact be more reliable than vehicles driven by \nunsafe, inexperienced, distracted or otherwise \naffected drivers behind the wheel. Machines \ndo not get tired. They do not operate under the \ninfluence of drugs or alcohol. They do not answer \nphones while driving. \nMany companies are working hard to meet the \ncapability and safety requirements of driverless \ncars. Imagine a future without the need to drive. The roads would become safer without human \noperators, and disabled people could have greater \nautonomy and mobility.\nFinally, think about how many lives could be \nsaved, given that most accidents are caused by \npeople who speed, drive under the influence, or \nfall asleep at the wheel. At some point in the \nfuture, there could be other autonomous vehicles, \nlike trains, ships and planes.\nDrones have been around for a long time. They \nhave been used since the beginning of the last \ncentury, under the name of remote-controlled \nplanes or unmanned planes.\nThe key difference between drones and unmanned \naircraft is accessibility to new AI technology. \nCurrent manufacturers can make a drone within \nthe price range of an individual, personal budget.\nAn Uber Eats autonomous car and drone was \nrecently announced at the 2109 Uber Elevate \nSummit. The idea is that if Uber makes use of \ndrones and autonomous cars, they can deliver \nfood faster. The drone would be able to deliver \nfood in less time because it does not have to deal \nwith traffic and is not limited by a maximum \nspeed, as opposed to cars travelling via roads.\nMany companies think that drones can reduce the \ncost and time of delivering products. Reducing \ncosts and shortening delivery times is a focus of \nmany businesses. With faster travel speed and \nno traffic to contend with, more deliveries per \nhour and no cost of human labour, drones could \nbecome the delivery option of the future.\nThere are drawbacks, however, including the \nweight of items being delivery. Drones are \ncurrently restricted by their carrying capacity. \n\u25b2 Figure  11.8 Soon enough we will find out whether autonomous \ncars are really safe or not\n \n\u25b2 Figure  11.9 Uses of drones in farming\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",

If a person is not \npresent to receive the items being delivered, the \ndelivery may not be made successfully. Items \nmight even be delivered to the wrong person. \nThere are also government regulations, limiting \nwhere drones can be flown, such as close to \nairports and within certain distances of people. \nThere are noise and insurance issues. A small \nnumber of countries have banned commercial \ndrones completely.\nChatbots and service bots\nEarlier in this chapter, we discussed virtual office \nassistants, also known as chatbots. Chatbots have \ndeveloped beyond the use as an office assistant and \nrecently there has been a greater focus on using \nchatbots for customer service. Chatbots can reduce \nthe costs associated with hiring people for customer \nservice jobs. Chatbots can be available 24 hours a \nday, seven days a week, and may be able to answer \ncustomers\u2019 questions in a shorter time than many \npeople working as customer service agents.\nChatbots can be simple or complex. They can \nprovide a service in industries where you would \nleast expect it. One of the newer industries using \nchatbots is the funeral industry. Recently, chatbots \nhave been used at people\u2019s time of death to share \ninformation with surviving family members and \nfuture generations.\nThese chatbots can be programmed to talk \nlike individual people. These chatbots can then \nimpersonate people who have died and will be \nable to tell future generations the story of that \nperson\u2019s life \u2018in person\u2019. This could provide comfort \nand memories for family members \u2013 memories \nthat might be lost if they were recorded using \nother means.Facial recognition\nAccording to a report in the South China Morning \nPost, China is building giant facial recognition \ndatabases to identify any Chinese citizen within \nseconds.\nThe aim, according to the report, is to match \nsomeone\u2019s face to their photo ID with about 90% \naccuracy. Although facial recognition has been \naround for some time, nothing has been created \non this scale to date.\nMany people have probably used phones that use \nsome features of facial recognition as part of the \nunlocking process. Other familiar uses of facial \nrecognition include automated passport control at \nairports and security scans in secure institutions.\nFuture commercial opportunities could also be \nexploited using a facial recognition database like \nthe one being constructed in China.\nFacial recognition could allow access to bank \naccounts, for boarding planes, or for entering \nschools or universities. There are many challenges \nahead, however, before this technology becomes \ncommon.\nThese challenges include privacy issues as well \nas how to recognise people if they change \nappearance (for example, if they put on weight, \ngrow a beard, change their hairstyle or wear \nmakeup or false eyelashes). The lighting and \nangle of images can also be a problem. At \nthis stage the future of facial recognition is \nrelatively uncertain.\n\u25b2 Figure  11.10  \u2018Bot\u2019 is short for \u2018robot\u2019, \u2018chatbot\u2019 is short for \n\u2018chatterbot\u2019! \u25b2 Figure  11.11  Facial recognition software\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",

The idea is that the \npolitical system is divided into three independent \nbranches, with each branch acting as a check and \nbalance on the other two. This is known as the \nseparation of powers.Figure 12.4 outlines how the separation of powers \nis structured in Australia\u2019s political system.\nThe key features of the Australian court system \nthat enable it to fulfil its roles of adjudicating legal \ndisputes and checking the power of government \nare described in the following section.\nA federal system\nThe federal  structure of Australia\u2019s political \nsystem, with law-making power shared by the \nCommonwealth and state parliaments, means the \ncourt system also has two levels:\n\u2022 Federal courts adjudicate on laws made by the \nCommonwealth Parliament\n\u2022 state or terr itory courts adjudicate on laws \npassed by their parliaments.\n\u25b2 Figure  12.6 There are three branches of government in the Australian politic al system: the judiciary, the parliament and the executive \ngovernment \u2013 the executive government branch is made up of members from the parliamentary branch\nParliament\nJudiciary\nExecutive\nAll members of both\nhouses and the Governor General\nor Governor\nThe Governor General \nor Governor, Prime Minister \nor Premier, and ministers\nThe courtsKEY TERMS\nadjudicating  determining the \noutcome of a legal dispute\nfederal  system of government in \nwhich power is shared between \na central national government \nand a number of regional \ngovernments\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 472": "465 12.2 Key fea tures of t He australian court system\nA hierarchical structure\nBoth the Federal and state court systems are \nhierarchical . This means the courts are ordered \nfrom low to high based on the seriousness of \nthe cases they hear. The jurisdiction  of most \ncourts is classified in terms of whether it a case \nis an original  or appellate  case, and whether \nthe dispute is criminal  or civil. Other courts \nhave specialist jurisdictions to hear particular \ntypes of cases. For example, the Children\u2019s Court \nhears criminal offences committed by children \nbetween 10 and 17 years, and the Coroner\u2019s Court \ninvestigates suspicious deaths and fires.\nThe original jurisdictions of the main courts \nin the State of Victoria are shown as part of \nTable 12.1.\nThe hierarchical structure of the courts is \nimportant because it allows the courts to specialise \nand develop expertise in hearing different types \nof cases. For example, in Victoria, the Supreme \nCourt\u2019s Trial Division hears the most serious \ncriminal offences, such as murder. It also makes appeals possible, so that a \nparty that is unhappy with \nthe outcome of a trial can \nask for it to be reviewed by \na higher court. For example, \nthe Murugappan family \nunsuccessfully appealed the \ndecision to deny them refugee \nstatus through all levels of the \nFederal court hierarchy, all the \nway to the High Court.\nThe system of precedents  \nis also dependant on a \nhierarchical court system. \nThis system is how courts \ncreate laws. The reason \nfor a judge\u2019s decision in a \nparticular case can create an \nexample that must be applied \nwhen judges in courts that \nare lower in the hierarchy \nconsider future cases with \nsimilar facts.\u25b2 Figure  12.7 The Australian court systemHigh Court of\nAustralia\nState Courts\nSupreme Court \u2013\nCourt of Appeal\nand Trial DivisionFamily Court\nCounty Court\nCoroners Court Children\u2019s Court Magistrates\u2019 CourtFederal Circuit\nCourtFederal CourtFederal Courts\nKEY TERMS\nhierarchy  structure arranged \nfrom low to high based on \nrelative importance or power\njurisdiction  the type of cases a \ncourt has the right to hear\noriginal jurisdiction  a court\u2019s \nright to hear a legal dispute for \nthe first time\nappellate jurisdiction  a court\u2019s \nright to hear an appeal about a \ndecision from a lower court\ncriminal law  area of law \ndealing with offences that affect \nthe community as a whole, \nin which offenders receive a \npunishment\ncivil law  area of law dealing \nwith disputes between \nindividuals or groups who believe \ntheir rights have been infringed\nprecedent  system of lawmaking \nthat allows a judgement or \ndecision made by a court to set \nan example that can be followed \nin future cases by courts lower in \nthe court hierarchy\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",

These include the three principles of \njustice : fairness, equality and access.\n\u2022 Fairness  requires the legal system to operate \nwith clear, consistent rules that are overseen by \nan impartial adjudicator.\n\u2022 Equalit y means that the legal system should \ntreat all people in the same way and provide \nthem with an equal opportunity to present \ntheir case, regardless of who they are.\n\u2022 Access  requires the legal system to provide the \nmeans to resolve legal disputes.\nThese principles are closely related to the \u2018rule of \nlaw,\u2019 the idea that in a democracy the law should \nbe fair and apply equally to all members of the \ncommunity.\nMany of the features of the Australian legal \nsystem already described in this chapter aim to \npromote the principles of justice. Australia has \nratified a number of treaties relating to different \naspects of human rights. These treaties confirm \nand establish in law the Australian Government\u2019s \ncommitment to a just legal system. They include \nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child and \nthe International Covenant on Civil and Political \nRights . \nThe independence of the Australian courts aims \nto ensure that judges can act without outside \ninfluence or pressure. This ensures that courts are \nrun fairly and that parties to a dispute are treated \nequally. The hierarchical structure of the courts \npromotes fairness, with appeals allowing higher \ncourts to review cases if one of the parties is \nunhappy with the outcome. The related system of \nprecedents ensures that there is consistency in  \nthe decisions made by judges.Finally, as the main \ninstitutions that resolve \nlegal disputes, the courts \nthemselves promote the \nprinciple of access.12.3 Key principles of Australia\u2019 s justice system\nFOCUS QUESTION\nHow do the principles of the Australian justice system support a fair society?\n\u25bc Figure  12.11  Lady Justice is a symbol of legal justice \ndeveloped in ancient Rome.

This \nhas created conflicting views among Australians.\nMany Australians support action on climate \nchange, but there remain sceptics  who deny or \ndownplay the connection between human activity \nand rising global temperatures. There are also \nindustries, such as the fossil fuel industry, that are \nconcerned that the profitability of their businesses \nwill be affected by climate change policies aimed \nat reducing carbon emissions\nPeople living where these industries are major \nemployers are also concerned about how climate \nchange policies will cause the loss of jobs, and \nhow this will affect their communities.\nThe conflict of views and interests over the \nclimate crisis has certainly contributed to the recent political instability in Australia, with six different prime ministers \nholding office between 2007 and 2019 (including Kevin Rudd twice). This political instability is reflected in Australian \nGovernment policies on climate change.\nMany attempts to address climate change through legislation have been thwarted. Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd\u2019s \nEmissions Trading Scheme was blocked in the Senate. Labor Prime Minister Julia Gillard introduced a Carbon Tax that \nwas overturned on the election of Prime Minister Tony Abbot\u2019s Liberal-National Coalition Government. Prime Ministers \nAbbot and Scott Morrison both introduced Direct Action policies to tackle climate change.\nFailure of the major Australian political parties to reach a consensus about \nclimate change policy, combined with what many sections of the community see \nas inaction on the climate crisis, has resulted in the emergence of new groups \ncampaigning on the issue.\nAmong these are a group of school students who were inspired by young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg to \norganise a series of school strikes and rallies in locations across Australia to demand that Australian governments \ntake action on the climate issue.\n\u25b2 Figure  12.15  Climate activists protesting in front of the Sydney Opera \nhouse in 2007\nKEY TERM\nsceptic  a person who doubts \nparticular beliefs, values or ideas\n1 https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2013/jun/26/kevin-rudd-australia-climate-change\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",

A diverse \nand free media is necessary in a representative \ndemocracy (such as Australia) to ensure that \ncitizens have access to the information required \nto make informed decisions when voting in \nelections.\nThis information comes from traditional media \noutlets such as television, radio, newspapers and \npublishers, and also from digital sources such as \nwebsites and social media platforms.\nThe ability for anyone to publish and comment on \nsocial media means that citizens are increasingly \ngaining information from a combination of \nprofessional  and amateur  news sources .The media can not only \nshape how people vote \nin elections, but also \ntheir personal political \nbeliefs, their identities, \nand how they view \nothers.\nHistorically, the media \nhas played a central \nrole in giving a voice \nto and promoting \nunderstanding between \nthe diverse cultures, \nethnicities and religions that comprise Australia\u2019s \nmulticultural  society. However, media coverage \ncan also encourage division and fear in the \ncommunity. This is demonstrated by the issues \ndiscussed in this chapter.\nSome sections of the Australian community \nbelieve that asylum seekers arriving in Australia \nby boat are \u2018illegal\u2019 \u2018queue-jumpers\u2019.

Perhaps the \ngreatest challenge, however, is indifference.\nIn Australia, like many other Western \ndemocracies, large sections of the community \nhave become disengaged from politics. They are \ndisillusioned by the democratic process and the \nleaders that it produces.\nThis disillusionment is reflected in a 2017  \nsurvey that showed only 60 per cent of voters \n(52 per cent of 18\u201329-year-olds) believe that \ndemocracy is preferable to other systems of \ngovernment.3 This so-called \u2018crisis of democracy\u2019 is \nin part due to the division, inaction and instability \ndescribed in the examples above.

This means that, by law, eligible \nvoters must vote in elections. In practice voters are only legally required to attend the polling place \u2013 because voting is secret, no one knows if or how they complete the ballot. Usually over 90 per cent of all eligible voters participate in Australian elections. This is a much higher voter turnout than countries with voluntary voting, such as the United States, where just over half of eligible voters cast votes in elections.\nSupporters of compulsory voting argue that it ensures that Australian political leaders represent a true majority \nof the population. Critics of compulsory voting claim that making voting compulsory breaches civil rights and lowers the standard of political debate as politicians attempt to attract the support of voters who are disinterested or uninformed.Amazing but true \u2026\n\u25b2 Figure 12.22  Ballot boxes from the 2010 Australian Federal election\nare making decisions for the benefit of vested interests rather than the majority of citizens.\nThe influence of lobbyists, the amount of \nmoney donated to political parties, and the frequency with which ministers resign from politics and immediately accept high-paying jobs with companies operating in areas of their ministerial responsibilities, all contribute to this feeling.\nThe danger of this indifference is that democracy \nrelies on informed and active citizens to operate effectively. The more engaged and informed voters are, the more likely that good governments that make good decisions are elected. This is particularly relevant to Australia, where voting is compulsory.\nBy disengaging from \npolitics, people are making it more likely that the issues and concerns that have caused their disillusionment with the democratic system are likely to continue or worsen.\nISBN 978-1-108-74915-2  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Adcock et al. 2022\nCambridge University Press",

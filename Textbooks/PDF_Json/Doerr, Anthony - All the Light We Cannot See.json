When she is six, she goes blind, and her father builds her a \nmodel of their neighborhood, every house, every manhole, so she can memorize it with \nher fingers and navigate the real streets with her feet and cane. When the Germans occupy \nParis, father and daughter flee to Saint-Malo on the Brittany coast, where Marie-Laure\u2019s \nagoraphobic great uncle lives in a tall, narrow house by the sea wall. \n \nIn another world in Germany, an orphan boy, Werner, grows up with his younger sister, Jutta, \nboth enchanted by a crude radio Werner finds. He becomes a master at building and fixing \nradios, a talent that wins him a place at an elite and brutal military academy and, ultimately, \nmakes him a highly specialized tracker of the Resistance. Werner travels through the heart of \nHitler Youth to the far-flung outskirts of Russia, and finally into Saint-Malo, where his path \nconverges with Marie-Laure. \n \nDoerr\u2019s gorgeous combination of soaring imagination with observation is electric. Deftly \ninterweaving the lives of Marie-Laure and Werner, Doerr illuminates the ways, against all odds, \npeople try to be good to one another.

  "Page 15": "5The Girl\nIn a corner of the city, inside a tall, narrow house at Number 4 rue \nVauborel, on the sixth and highest floor, a sightless sixteen-year-old \nnamed Marie-Laure LeBlanc kneels over a low table covered entirely with a model. The model is a miniature of the city she kneels within, and contains scale replicas of the hundreds of houses and shops and hotels within its walls. There\u2019s the cathedral with its perforated spire, and the bulky old Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Malo, and row after row of sea-side mansions studded with chimneys. A slender wooden jetty arcs out from a beach called the Plage du M\u00f4le; a delicate, reticulated atrium vaults over the seafood market; minute benches, the smallest no larger than apple seeds, dot the tiny public squares.\nMarie-Laure runs her fingertips along the centimeter-wide para-\npet crowning the ramparts, drawing an uneven star shape around the entire model. She finds the opening atop the walls where four ceremo-nial cannons point to sea. \u201cBastion de la Hollande,\u201d she whispers, and her fingers walk down a little staircase. \u201cThe rue des Cordiers. The rue Jacques Cartier.\u201d\nIn a corner of the room stand two galvanized buckets filled to the \nrim with water. Fill them up, her great-uncle has taught her, whenever you can. The bathtub on the third floor too. Who knows when the water will go out again.\nHer fingers travel back to the cathedral spire. South to the Gate \nof Dinan. All evening she has been marching her fingers around the model, waiting for her great-uncle Etienne, who owns this house, who went out the previous night while she slept, and who has not returned. And now it is night again, another revolution of the clock, and the whole block is quiet, and she cannot sleep.\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   5 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

No footfalls on the cobbles. Not even gulls. Just a high tide, one block away and six stories below, lapping at the base of the city walls.\nAnd something else.Something rattling softly, very close. She eases open the left-hand \nshutter and runs her fingers up the slats of the right. A sheet of paper has lodged there.\nShe holds it to her nose. It smells of fresh ink. Gasoline, maybe. The \npaper is crisp; it has not been outside long.\nMarie-Laure hesitates at the window in her stocking feet, her bed-\nroom behind her, seashells arranged along the top of the armoire, pebbles along the baseboards. Her cane stands in the corner; her big Braille novel waits facedown on the bed. The drone of the airplanes grows.\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   6 12/13/13   10:50 AM",
  "Page 17": "7The Boy\nFive streets to the north, a white-haired eighteen-year-old German \nprivate named Werner Pfennig wakes to a faint staccato hum. \nLittle more than a purr. Flies tapping at a far-off windowpane.\nWhere is he? The sweet, slightly chemical scent of gun oil; the raw \nwood of newly constructed shell crates; the mothballed odor of old bedspreads\u2014he\u2019s in the hotel. Of course. L \u2019h\u00f4tel des Abeilles, the Hotel of Bees.\nStill night. Still early.From the direction of the sea come whistles and booms; flak is \ngoing up.\nAn anti-air corporal hurries down the corridor, heading for the \nstairwell. \u201cGet to the cellar,\u201d he calls over his shoulder, and Werner switches on his field light, rolls his blanket into his duffel, and starts down the hall.\nNot so long ago, the Hotel of Bees was a cheerful address, with \nbright blue shutters on its facade and oysters on ice in its caf\u00e9 and Breton waiters in bow ties polishing glasses behind its bar. It offered twenty-one guest rooms, commanding sea views, and a lobby fireplace as big as a truck. Parisians on weekend holidays would drink aperitifs here, and before them the occasional emissary from the republic\u2014ministers and vice ministers and abbots and admirals\u2014and in the cen-turies before them, windburned corsairs: killers, plunderers, raiders, seamen.\nBefore that, before it was ever a hotel at all, five full centuries ago, it \nwas the home of a wealthy privateer who gave up raiding ships to study bees in the pastures outside Saint-Malo, scribbling in notebooks and eating honey straight from combs. The crests above the door lintels \nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   7 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

Werner\u2019s favorites are five faded frescoes on the ceilings of the grandest upper rooms, where bees as big as children float against blue backdrops, big lazy drones and workers with diaphanous wings\u2014where, above a hexagonal bathtub, a single nine-foot-long queen, with multiple eyes and a golden-furred abdo-men, curls across the ceiling.\nOver the past four weeks, the hotel has become something else: \na fortress. A detachment of Austrian anti-airmen has boarded up every window, overturned every bed. They\u2019ve reinforced the entrance, packed the stairwells with crates of artillery shells. The hotel\u2019s fourth floor, where garden rooms with French balconies open directly onto the ramparts, has become home to an aging high-velocity anti-air gun called an 88 that can fire twenty-one-and-a-half-pound shells nine miles.\nHer Majesty, the Austrians call their cannon, and for the past week \nthese men have tended to it the way worker bees might tend to a queen. They\u2019ve fed her oils, repainted her barrels, lubricated her wheels; they\u2019ve arranged sandbags at her feet like offerings.\nThe royal acht acht, a deathly monarch meant to protect them all.Werner is in the stairwell, halfway to the ground floor, when the 88 \nfires twice in quick succession. It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s heard the gun at such close range, and it sounds as if the top half of the hotel has torn off. He stumbles and throws his arms over his ears. The walls reverber-ate all the way down into the foundation, then back up.\nWerner can hear the Austrians two floors up scrambling, reload-\ning, and the receding screams of both shells as they hurtle above the ocean, already two or three miles away. One of the soldiers, he realizes, is singing. Or maybe it is more than one. Maybe they are all singing. Eight Luftwaffe men, none of whom will survive the hour, singing a love song to their queen.\nWerner chases the beam of his field light through the lobby. The big \ngun detonates a third time, and glass shatters somewhere close by, and torrents of soot rattle down the chimney, and the walls of the hotel toll \nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   8 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

Werner worries that the sound will knock the teeth \nfrom his gums.\nHe drags open the cellar door and pauses a moment, vision swim-\nming. \u201cThis is it?\u201d he asks. \u201cThey\u2019re really coming?\u201d\nBut who is there to answer?\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   9 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

Procrastinators, \ncollaborators, disbelievers, drunks. Nuns of every order. The poor. The stubborn. The blind.\nSome hurry to bomb shelters. Some tell themselves it is merely a \ndrill. Some linger to grab a blanket or a prayer book or a deck of play-\ning cards.\nD-day was two months ago. Cherbourg has been liberated, Caen \nliberated, Rennes too. Half of western France is free. In the east, the Soviets have retaken Minsk; the Polish Home Army is revolting in Warsaw; a few newspapers have become bold enough to suggest that the tide has turned.\nBut not here. Not this last citadel at the edge of the continent, this \nfinal German strongpoint on the Breton coast.\nHere, people whisper, the Germans have renovated two kilometers \nof subterranean corridors under the medieval walls; they have built new defenses, new conduits, new escape routes, underground com-plexes of bewildering intricacy. Beneath the peninsular fort of La Cit\u00e9, across the river from the old city, there are rooms of bandages, rooms of ammunition, even an underground hospital, or so it is believed. There is air-conditioning, a two-hundred-thousand-liter water tank, a direct line to Berlin. There are flame-throwing booby traps, a net of pillboxes with periscopic sights; they have stockpiled enough ordnance to spray shells into the sea all day, every day, for a year.\nHere, they whisper, are a thousand Germans ready to die. Or five \nthousand. Maybe more.\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   10 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

At the highest tides, the sea \ncreeps into basements at the very center of town. At the lowest tides, the barnacled ribs of a thousand shipwrecks stick out above the sea.\nFor three thousand years, this little promontory has known sieges.But never like this.A grandmother lifts a fussy toddler to her chest. A drunk, urinating \nin an alley outside Saint-Servan, a mile away, plucks a sheet of paper from a hedge. Urgent message to the inhabitants of this town, it says. Depart immediately to open country.\nAnti-air batteries flash on the outer islands, and the big German \nguns inside the old city send another round of shells howling over the sea, and three hundred and eighty Frenchmen imprisoned on an island fortress called National, a quarter mile off the beach, huddle in a moonlit courtyard peering up.\nFour years of occupation, and the roar of oncoming bombers is the \nroar of what? Deliverance? Extirpation?\nThe clack-clack of small-arms fire. The gravelly snare drums of \nflak.

She should be making for the corner of the kitchen where a little trapdoor opens into a cellar full of dust and mouse-chewed rugs and ancient trunks long unopened.\nInstead she returns to the table at the foot of the bed and kneels \nbeside the model of the city.\nAgain her fingers find the outer ramparts, the Bastion de la Hol-\nlande, the little staircase leading down.

Behind crates and cabinets and peg-\nboards of tools, the walls are bare granite. Three massive hand-hewn beams, hauled here from some ancient Breton forest and craned into place centuries ago by teams of horses, hold up the ceiling.\nA single lightbulb casts everything in a wavering shadow.Werner Pfennig sits on a folding chair in front of a workbench, \nchecks his battery level, and puts on headphones. The radio is a steel-cased two-way transceiver with a 1.6-meter band antenna. It enables him to communicate with a matching transceiver upstairs, with two other anti-air batteries inside the walls of the city, and with the under-ground garrison command across the river mouth.\nThe transceiver hums as it warms. A spotter reads coordinates into \nthe headpiece, and an artilleryman repeats them back. Werner rubs his eyes. Behind him, confiscated treasures are crammed to the ceil-ing: rolled tapestries, grandfather clocks, armoires, and giant landscape paintings crazed with cracks. On a shelf opposite Werner sit eight or nine plaster heads, the purpose of which he cannot guess.\nThe massive staff sergeant Frank Volkheimer comes down the nar-\nrow wooden stairs and ducks his head beneath the beams. He smiles gently at Werner and sits in a tall-backed armchair upholstered in golden silk with his rifle across his huge thighs, where it looks like little more than a baton.\nWerner says, \u201cIt\u2019s starting?\u201dVolkheimer nods. He switches off his field light and blinks his \nstrangely delicate eyelashes in the dimness.\n\u201cHow long will it last?\u201d\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   14 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

Above them, \nthe ceiling bulb flickers.\nWater, thinks Werner. I forgot water.A second anti-air battery fires from a distant corner of the city, and \nthen the 88 upstairs goes again, stentorian, deadly, and Werner listens to the shell scream into the sky. Cascades of dust hiss out of the ceil-ing. Through his headphones, Werner can hear the Austrians upstairs still singing.\n.\n . . auf d\u2019Wulda, auf d\u2019Wulda, da scheint d\n\u2019Sunn a so gulda  . . .\nVolkheimer picks sleepily at a stain on his trousers.

Stars wheeling past a dormer window. His little sister, Jutta, with a quilt around her shoulders and a radio earpiece trailing from her left ear.\nFour stories up, the Austrians clap another shell into the smoking \nbreech of the 88 and double-check the traverse and clamp their ears as the gun discharges, but down here Werner hears only the radio voices of his childhood. The Goddess of History looked down to earth. Only through the hottest fires can purification be achieved. He sees a forest of dying sunflowers. He sees a flock of blackbirds explode out of a tree.\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   15 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

Marie-Laure squints up at the \nnaked bulbs strung in three-yard intervals along the ceiling; each sets a rainbow-colored halo rotating in her vision.\nThe guide hangs his cane on his wrist and rubs his hands together. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story. Do you want to hear a long story?\u201d\nThey nod.He clears his throat. \u201cCenturies ago, in the place we now call Bor-\nneo, a prince plucked a blue stone from a dry riverbed because he thought it was pretty. But on the way back to his palace, the prince was attacked by men on horseback and stabbed in the heart.\u201d\n\u201cStabbed in the heart?\u201d\u201cIs this true?\u201dA boy says, \u201cHush.\u201d\u201cThe thieves stole his rings, his horse, everything. But because the \nlittle blue stone was clenched in his fist, they did not discover it. And the dying prince managed to crawl home. Then he fell unconscious for ten days. On the tenth day, to the amazement of his nurses, he sat up, opened his hand, and there was the stone.\n\u201cThe sultan\u2019s doctors said it was a miracle, that the prince never \nshould have survived such a violent wound. The nurses said the stone must have healing powers. The sultan\u2019s jewelers said something else: they said the stone was the largest raw diamond anyone had ever seen. Their most gifted stonecutter spent eighty days faceting it, and when he was done, it was a brilliant blue, the blue of tropical seas, but it had a touch of red at its center, like flames inside a drop of water. The sultan had the diamond fitted into a crown for the prince, and it was said that when the young prince sat on his throne and the sun hit him just so, he became so dazzling that visitors could not distinguish his figure from light itself.\u201d\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   20 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

Some believed \nthe prince was a deity, that as long as he kept the stone, he could not be killed. But something strange began to happen: the longer the prince wore his crown, the worse his luck became. In a month, he lost a brother to drowning and a second brother to snakebite. Within six months, his father died of disease. To make matters even worse, the sultan\u2019s scouts announced that a great army was gathering in the east.\n\u201cThe prince called together his father\u2019s advisers. All said he should \nprepare for war, all but one, a priest, who said he\u2019d had a dream. In the dream the Goddess of the Earth told him she\u2019d made the Sea of Flames as a gift for her lover, the God of the Sea, and was sending the jewel to him through the river. But when the river dried up, and the prince plucked it out, the goddess became enraged. She had cursed the stone and whoever kept it.\u201d\nEvery child leans forward, Marie-Laure along with them.\u201cThe curse was this: the keeper of the stone would live forever, but \nso long as he kept it, misfortunes would fall on all those he loved one after another in unending rain.\u201d\n\u201cLive forever?\u201d\u201cBut if the keeper threw the diamond into the sea, thereby deliver-\ning it to its rightful recipient, the goddess would lift the curse. So the prince, now sultan, thought for three days and three nights and finally decided to keep the stone. It had saved his life; he believed it made him indestructible. He had the tongue cut out of the priest\u2019s mouth.\u201d\n\u201cOuch,\u201d says the youngest boy.\u201cBig mistake,\u201d says the tallest girl.\u201cThe invaders came,\u201d says the warder, \u201cand destroyed the palace, \nand killed everyone they found, and the prince was never seen again, and for two hundred years no one heard any more about the Sea of Flames.

Until one day, when a French \ndiamond trader, during a trip to the Golconda Mines in India, was shown a massive pear-cut diamond. One hundred and thirty-three carats. Near-perfect clarity. As big as a pigeon\u2019s egg, he wrote, and as blue as the sea, but with a flare of red at its core. He made a casting of the stone and sent it to a gem-crazy duke in Lorraine, warning him of the rumors of a curse. But the duke wanted the diamond very badly. So the trader brought it to Europe, and the duke fitted it into the end of a walking stick and carried it everywhere.\u201d\n\u201cUh-oh.\u201d\u201cWithin a month, the duchess contracted a throat disease. T wo of \ntheir favorite servants fell off the roof and broke their necks. Then the duke\u2019s only son died in a riding accident. Though everyone said the duke himself had never looked better, he became afraid to go out, afraid to accept visitors. Eventually he was so convinced that his stone was the accursed Sea of Flames that he asked the king to shut it up in his museum on the conditions that it be locked deep inside a specially built vault and the vault not be opened for two hundred years.\u201d\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cAnd one hundred and ninety-six years have passed.\u201dAll the children remain quiet a moment.

It\u2019s steel country, anthra-cite country, a place full of holes. Smokestacks fume and locomotives trundle back and forth on elevated conduits and leafless trees stand atop slag heaps like skeleton hands shoved up from the underworld.\nWerner and his younger sister, Jutta, are raised at Children\u2019s House, \na clinker-brick two-story orphanage on Viktoriastrasse whose rooms are populated with the coughs of sick children and the crying of new-borns and battered trunks inside which drowse the last possessions of deceased parents: patchwork dresses, tarnished wedding cutlery, faded ambrotypes of fathers swallowed by the mines.\nWerner\u2019s earliest years are the leanest. Men brawl over jobs outside \nthe Zollverein gates, and chicken eggs sell for two million reichsmarks apiece, and rheumatic fever stalks Children\u2019s House like a wolf. There is no butter or meat. Fruit is a memory. Some evenings, during the worst months, all the house directress has to feed her dozen wards are cakes made from mustard powder and water.\nBut seven-year-old Werner seems to float. He is undersized and his \nears stick out and he speaks with a high, sweet voice; the whiteness of his hair stops people in their tracks. Snowy, milky, chalky. A color that is the absence of color. Every morning he ties his shoes, packs newspa-per inside his coat as insulation against the cold, and begins interro-gating the world. He captures snowflakes, tadpoles, hibernating frogs; he coaxes bread from bakers with none to sell; he regularly appears in the kitchen with fresh milk for the babies. He makes things too: paper boxes, crude biplanes, toy boats with working rudders.\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   24 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

She sings French folk songs in a screechy falsetto, harbors a weakness for sherry, and regularly falls asleep stand-ing up. Some nights she lets the children stay up late while she tells them stories in French about her girlhood cozied up against moun-tains, snow six feet deep on rooftops, town criers and creeks smoking in the cold and frost-dusted vineyards: a Christmas-carol world.\n\u201cCan deaf people hear their heartbeat, Frau Elena?\u201d\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t glue stick to the inside of the bottle, Frau Elena?\u201dShe\u2019ll laugh.

His sister sneaks up to Werner\u2019s cot, \nand together they lie on their stomachs and pass a single pencil back and forth. Jutta, though she is two years younger, is the gifted one. She loves most of all to draw Paris, a city she has seen in exactly one photo-graph, on the back cover of one of Frau Elena\u2019s romance novels: man-sard roofs, hazy apartment blocks, the iron lattice of a distant tower. She draws twisting white skyscrapers, complicated bridges, flocks of figures beside a river.\nOther days, in the hours after lessons, Werner tows his little sister \nthrough the mine complex in a wagon he has assembled from cast-off parts. They rattle down the long gravel lanes, past pit cottages and trash barrel fires, past laid-off miners squatting all day on upturned crates, motionless as statues. One wheel regularly clunks off and Wer-ner crouches patiently beside it, threading back the bolts. All around them, the figures of second-shift workers shuffle into warehouses while \nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   25 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

They tear berries out of brambles and dandelions out of fields. Sometimes they manage to find potato peels or carrot greens in trash bins; other afternoons they collect paper to draw on, or old toothpaste tubes from which the last dregs can be squeezed out and dried into chalk. Once in a while Werner tows Jutta as far as the entrance to Pit Nine, the largest of the mines, wrapped in noise, lit like the pilot at the center of a gas furnace, a five-story coal elevator crouched over it, cables swinging, hammers banging, men shouting, an entire mapful of pleated and corrugated industry stretching into the distance on all sides, and they watch the coal cars trundling up from the earth and the miners spilling out of warehouses with their lunch pails toward the mouth of the elevator like insects toward a lighted trap.\n\u201cDown there,\u201d Werner whispers to his sister. \u201cThat\u2019s where Father \ndied.\u201d\nAnd as night falls, Werner pulls little Jutta wordlessly back through \nthe close-set neighborhoods of Zollverein, two snowy-haired children in a bottomland of soot, bearing their paltry treasures to Viktoria-strasse 3, where Frau Elena stares into the coal stove, singing a French lullaby in a tired voice, one toddler yanking her apron strings while another howls in her arms.\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   26 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

  "Page 45": "35T ake Us Home\nUsually Marie-Laure can solve the wooden puzzle boxes her father \ncreates for her birthdays. Often they are shaped like houses and \ncontain some hidden trinket. Opening them involves a cunning series of steps: find a seam with your fingernails, slide the bottom to the right, detach a side rail, remove a hidden key from inside the rail, unlock the top, and discover a bracelet inside.\nFor her seventh birthday, a tiny wooden chalet stands in the center \nof the kitchen table where the sugar bowl ought to be. She slides a hid-den drawer out of the base, finds a hidden compartment beneath the drawer, takes out a wooden key, and slots the key inside the chimney. Inside waits a square of Swiss chocolate.\n\u201cFour minutes,\u201d says her father, laughing. \u201cI\u2019ll have to work harder \nnext year.\u201d\nFor a long time, though, unlike his puzzle boxes, his model of \ntheir neighborhood makes little sense to her. It is not like the real world. The miniature intersection of rue de Mirbel and rue Monge, for example, just a block from their apartment, is nothing like the real intersection. The real one presents an amphitheater of noise and fragrance: in the fall it smells of traffic and castor oil, bread from the bakery, camphor from Avent\u2019s pharmacy, delphiniums and sweet peas and roses from the flower stand. On winter days it swims with the odor of roasting chestnuts; on summer evenings it becomes slow and drowsy, full of sleepy conversations and the scraping of heavy iron chairs.\nBut her father\u2019s model of the same intersection smells only of dried \nglue and sawdust. Its streets are empty, its pavements static; to her \nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   35 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

Crows shout, brakes hiss, someone \nto her left bangs something metal with what might be a hammer. She shuffles forward until the tip of her cane floats in space. The edge of a curb? A pond, a staircase, a cliff? She turns ninety degrees. Three steps forward. Now her cane finds the base of a wall. \u201cPapa?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201dSix paces seven paces eight.

In a week he can dismantle and rebuild it with his eyes closed. Capacitor, inductor, tuning coil, earpiece. One wire goes to ground, the other to sky. Nothing he\u2019s encountered before has made so much sense.\nHe harvests parts from supply sheds: snips of copper wire, screws, a \nbent screwdriver. He charms the druggist\u2019s wife into giving him a bro-ken earphone; he salvages a solenoid from a discarded doorbell, solders it to a resistor, and makes a loudspeaker. Within a month he manages to redesign the receiver entirely, adding new parts here and there and connecting it to a power source.\nEvery evening he carries his radio downstairs, and Frau Elena lets \nher wards listen for an hour. They tune in to newscasts, concerts, operas, national choirs, folk shows, a dozen children in a semicircle on the furniture, Frau Elena among them, hardly more substantial than a child herself.\nWe live in exciting times, says the radio. We make no complaints. We \nwill plant our feet firmly in our earth, and no attack will move us.\nThe older girls like musical competitions, radio gymnastics, a regu-\nlar spot called Seasonal Tips for Those in Love that makes the younger children squeal.

Is not the flame of a new \nfaith rising from this sacrificial readiness?\nIndeed it does seem to Werner, as the weeks go by, that some-\nthing new is rising. Mine production increases; unemployment drops. Meat appears at Sunday supper. Lamb, pork, wieners\u2014extravagances unheard of a year before. Frau Elena buys a new couch upholstered in orange corduroy, and a range with burners in black rings; three new Bibles arrive from the consistory in Berlin; a laundry boiler is delivered to the back door. Werner gets new trousers; Jutta gets her own pair of shoes. Working telephones ring in the houses of neighbors.\nOne afternoon, on the walk home from school, Werner stops out-\nside the drugstore and presses his nose to a tall window: five dozen inch-tall storm troopers march there, each toy man with a brown shirt and tiny red armband, some with flutes, some with drums, a few offi-cers astride glossy black stallions. Above them, suspended from a wire, a tinplate clockwork aquaplane with wooden pontoons and a rotat-ing propeller makes an electric, hypnotizing orbit. Werner studies it through the glass for a long time, trying to understand how it works.\nNight falls, autumn in 1936, and Werner carries the radio down-\nstairs and sets it on the sideboard, and the other children fidget in anticipation. The receiver hums as it warms. Werner steps back, hands in pockets. From the loudspeaker, a children\u2019s choir sings, We hope only to work, to work and work and work, to go to glorious work for the country. Then a state-sponsored play out of Berlin begins: a story of \ninvaders sneaking into a village at night.\nAll twelve children sit riveted. In the play, the invaders pose as \nhook-nosed department-store owners, crooked jewelers, dishonor-able bankers; they sell glittering trash; they drive established village businessmen out of work. Soon they plot to murder German children in their beds. Eventually a vigilant and humble neighbor catches on. Police are called: big handsome-sounding policemen with splendid voices. They break down the doors. They drag the invaders away. A patriotic march plays. Everyone is happy again.\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   39 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

Into bark, twigs, stems. Because plants eat light, in much the way we eat food. But then the plant died and fell, probably into water, and decayed into peat, and the peat was folded inside the earth for years upon years\u2014eons in which something like a month or a decade or even your whole life was just a puff of air, a snap of two fingers.

Not once.\nAlmost immediately afterward, her father begins working deep \nwithin the Gallery of Mineralogy. For weeks he wheels carts loaded with various pieces of equipment in and out of the key pound, work-ing long after the museum has closed, and every night he returns to the key pound smelling of brazing alloy and sawdust.

He said you can use a section of wire fence to pick up radio signals, so maybe the silver in a tooth can too. I like to think about that. Dont you Professor? Songs in your teeth? Frau Elena says we have to come straight home from school now. She says were not Jews but were poor and thats almost as dangerous. Its a criminal offense now to tune into a foreign broadcast. You can get hard labor for it, things like breaking rocks all day fifteen hours a day. Or making nylon stockings or going down in the pits.

A five-year-old\u2014Rolf Hupfauer\u2014sits in the corner of the sofa, eye-lids slipping heavily over his eyes. A new arrival\u2014a baby girl\u2014sits in Jutta\u2019s lap and gums her fingers.

In the alleys, fifteen-year-old boys are making their way toward mine elevators, queuing up with their helmets and lamps outside the gates. He tries to imagine their descent, sporadic and muted lights passing and reced-ing, cables rattling, everyone quiet, sinking down to that permanent darkness where men claw at the earth with a half mile of rock hunched on top of them.\nOne more year. Then they\u2019ll give him a helmet and lamp and stuff  \nhim into a cage with the others.\nIt has been months since he last heard the Frenchman on the short-\nwave.

Werner presses his fore-\nhead to the window of the dormer and peers through the drops, the roof below just one among a cluster of wet rooftops, hemmed in by the vast walls of the cokery and smelter and gasworks, the winding tower silhouetted against the sky, mine and mill running on and on, acre after acre, beyond his range of sight, to the villages, the cities, the ever-quickening, ever expanding machine that is Germany. And a million men ready to set down their lives for it.\nGood evening, he thinks. Or heil Hitler. Everyone is choosing the \nlatter.\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   69 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

A small cadre of couriers has \nbegun moving things to country estates. Locks and keys are in greater demand than ever. Marie-Laure\u2019s father works until midnight, until one. Every crate must be padlocked, every transport manifest kept in a secure place. Armored trucks rumble at the loading docks. There are fossils to be safeguarded, ancient manuscripts; there is jade from the thirteenth century and cavansite from India and rhodochrosite from Colorado; there are pearls, gold nuggets, a sapphire as big as a mouse. There might be, thinks Marie-Laure, the Sea of Flames.\nFrom a certain angle, the spring seems so calm: warm, tender, each \nnight redolent and composed. And yet everything radiates tension, as if the city has been built upon the skin of a balloon and someone is inflating it toward the breaking point.\nBees work the blooming aisles of the Jardin des Plantes. The plane \ntrees drop their seeds and huge drifts of fluff gather on the walkways.\nIf they attack, why would they attack, they would be crazy to attack.To retreat is to save lives.Deliveries stop. Sandbags appear around the museum gates. A pair \nof soldiers on the roof of the Gallery of Paleontology peer over the gar-dens with binoculars.

T rucks carry off skeletons and meteorites and octopi in jars and herbarium sheets and Egyptian gold and South African ivory and Permian fossils.\nOn the first of June, airplanes fly over the city, extremely high, crawl-\ning through the stratus clouds. When the wind is down and nobody is running an engine nearby, Marie-Laure can stand outside the Gallery of Zoology and hear them: a mile-high purr. The following day, the radio stations begin disappearing. The warders in the guards\u2019 station whack the side of their wireless and tilt it this way and that, but only static comes out of its speaker. As if each relay antenna were a candle flame and a pair of fingers came along and pinched it out.\nThose last nights in Paris, walking home with her father at mid-\nnight, the huge book clasped against her chest, Marie-Laure thinks she can sense a shiver beneath the air, in the pauses between the chir-ring of the insects, like the spider cracks of ice when too much weight is set upon it.

He thinks: They know.\nThe lance corporal looks around the room\u2014the coal stove, the \nhanging laundry, the undersize children\u2014with equal measures of con-descension and hostility.

A maid in a high-waisted dress \ntakes their coats, expertly flips off the water, and hangs them on a brass-footed rack. The kitchen smells of cake.\nThe corporal steers Werner into a dining room where a narrow-\nfaced woman with three fresh daisies stuck through her hair sits in a chair turning the pages of a magazine. \u201cT wo wet ducks,\u201d she says, and looks back at her magazine. She does not ask them to sit.\nA thick red carpet sucks at the soles of Werner\u2019s brogues; electric \nbulbs burn in a chandelier above the table; roses twine across the wall-paper.

Herr Siedler stands in front of the radio \nand seems about to pat him on the head. \u201cOutstanding,\u201d he says. He ushers Werner to the dining table and calls for the maid to bring cake. Immediately it appears: four wedges on a plain white plate. Each is dusted with confectioners\u2019 sugar and topped by a dollop of whipped cream. Werner gapes. Herr Siedler laughs. \u201cCream is forbidden. I know. But\u201d\u2014he puts a forefinger to his lips\u2014\u201cthere are ways around such things. Go on.\u201d\nWerner takes a piece.

The radio purrs and the woman \nlaughs and Herr Siedler looks almost nothing, Werner decides, like his neighbors, their guarded, anxious faces\u2014faces of people accustomed to watching loved ones disappear every morning into pits. His face is clean and committed; he is a man supremely confident in his privi-leges. And five yards away kneels this woman with varnished finger-nails and hairless calves\u2014a woman so entirely removed from Werner\u2019s previous experience that it is as if she is from a different planet. As if she has stepped out of the big Philco itself.\n\u201cGood with tools,\u201d Herr Siedler is saying. \u201cSmart beyond your years. \nThere are places for a boy like you.

It is best, the director said, that no man \nknows whether he carries the real diamond or a reproduction. And everyone, he said, giving them each a grave look, should behave as if he carries the real thing.\nThe locksmith tells himself that the diamond he carries is not real. \nThere is no way the director would knowingly give a tradesman a one-hundred-and-thirty-three-carat diamond and let him walk out of Paris with it.

Marie-Laure breathes the measured breath of sleep. Everyone should behave as if he carries the real thing. The lock-smith reties the stone inside the bag and slips it back into his rucksack.

Finally the light settles. With the flashlight in his mouth, in those granular, high-slung shadows, Volkheimer lifts pieces of brick and mortar and plaster, chunk after chunk, shredded boards and slabs of stucco\u2014there is something beneath all of this, Werner sees, buried under these heavy things, a form coming into shape.\nThe engineer.

Werner, only a few feet away, hears no change in the air.\nThe structure around them gives off another tremor, and hot dust \ncascades everywhere.\nSoon Volkheimer\u2019s light is making a circuit of what is left of the \nroof. The three huge wooden beams have cracked, but none has given way entirely. Between them the stucco is spiderwebbed, and pipes poke through in two places.

One of the radiators clangs and steams all day despite various attempts to shut it down. War ministry flags as big as tanks hang from the rafters.\nThere are one hundred recruits, all boys. A school representative \nin a black uniform arranges them in ranks four deep. Medals chime on his chest as he paces. \u201cYou are,\u201d he declares, \u201cattempting to enter the most elite schools in the world. The exams will last eight days.

The boys shuck their clothes where they stand.\nWerner counts twenty-six others in his age group. All but two are \ntaller than he is. All but three are blond. None of them wear eyeglasses.\nThe boys spend that entire first morning in their new white out-\nfits, filling out questionnaires on clipboards. There is no noise save the scribbling of pencils and the pacing of examiners and the clunking of the huge radiator.\nWhere was your grandfather born? What color are your father\u2019s eyes? \nHas your mother ever worked in an office? Of one hundred and ten ques-tions about his lineage, Werner can accurately answer only sixteen. The rest are guesses.\nWhere is your mother from?There are no options for past tense.

She said Werner should do his best. \u201cYou\u2019re a smart boy,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll do well.\u201d She kept adjusting and readjusting his col-lar. When he said, \u201cIt\u2019s only a week,\u201d her eyes filled slowly, as if some internal flood were gradually overwhelming her.\nIn the afternoon, the recruits run. They crawl under obstacles, do \npush-ups, scale ropes suspended from the ceiling\u2014one hundred chil-dren passing sleek and interchangeable in their white uniforms like livestock before the eyes of the examiners. Werner comes in ninth in the shuttle runs. He comes in second to last on the rope climb. He will never be good enough.\nIn the evening, the boys spill out of the hall, some met by proud-\nlooking parents with automobiles, others vanishing purposefully in twos and threes into the streets: all seem to know where they\u2019re going. Werner makes his way alone to a spartan hostel six blocks away, where he rents a bed for two marks a night and lies among muttering itin-erants and listens to the pigeons and bells and shuddering traffic of Essen. It is the first night he has spent outside of Zollverein, and he cannot stop thinking of Jutta, who has not spoken to him since dis-covering he smashed their radio. Who stared at him with so much accusation in her face that he had to look away.

They require \nlittle of Werner except to raise his arms or keep from blinking while an inspector shines a penlight into the tunnels of his pupils. He sweats and shifts. His heart pounds unreasonably. An onion-breathed tech-nician in a lab coat measures the distance between Werner\u2019s temples, the circumference of his head, and the thickness and shape of his lips. Calipers are used to evaluate his feet, the length of his fingers, and the \nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   113 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

Both of his forearms are bent at nauseating angles. \nHe blinks at them curiously for a moment, as if scanning his memory for a clue that might explain how he got there.\nThen he starts to scream. Werner looks away. Four boys are ordered \nto carry the injured one out.\nOne by one, the remaining fourteen-year-olds climb the ladder and \ntremble and leap. One sobs the whole way. Another sprains an ankle when he hits. The next waits at least two full minutes before jumping.

He is paying farmers near Cancale to butcher lambs and rabbits; Claude buckles the meat into his wife\u2019s matching vinyl suitcases and carries them himself by train to Paris. It is easy: some weeks he can make as much as five hundred francs. Supply and demand. There is always paperwork, of course; some official up the chain catches a whiff and wants a percentage. It takes a mind like Claude\u2019s to navigate the complexities of the business.\nToday he is overheating; sweat trickles down his back and sides. \nSaint-Malo roasts. October is here, and bright cold winds ought to pour off the ocean; leaves ought to tumble down the alleys. But the wind has come and gone. As if deciding it did not like the changes here.\nAll afternoon Claude hunkers inside his shop above the hundreds \nof little bottles of florals and orientals and foug\u00e8res in his vitrine, pinks and carmines and baby blues, and no one enters, and an oscillating electric fan blows across his face to the left, then to the right, and he does not read or move at all except to periodically reach a hand beneath his stool and grabble for a handful of biscuits from a round tin and stuff them into his mouth.\nAround four p.m., a small company of German soldiers strolls up \nthe rue Vauborel. They are lean, salmon-faced, and earnest; they have serious eyes; they carry their weapons barrel-down, slinging them over \nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   164 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

They always seem to be going somewhere and never doubt that it is the right place to be going. Something his own country has lacked.\nThe soldiers turn down the rue St. Philippe and are gone. Claude\u2019s \nfingers trace ovals across the top of his vitrine. Upstairs his wife runs a vacuum cleaner; he can hear it coursing round and round. He is nearly asleep when he sees the Parisian who has been living three doors down exit the house of Etienne LeBlanc. A thin beak-nosed man who skulks outside the telegraph office, whittling little wooden boxes.\nThe Parisian walks in the same direction as the German soldiers, \nplacing the heel of one foot against the toe of the other. He reaches the end of the street, scribbles something on a pad, turns one hundred and eighty degrees, and walks back. When he reaches the end of the block, he stares up at the Sajers\u2019 house and makes several more notes. Glancing up, glancing down. Measuring. Biting the eraser of his pencil as though uneasy.\nBig Claude goes to the window. This too could be an opportunity. \nOccupation authorities will want to know that a stranger is pacing off distances and making drawings of houses. They will want to know what he looks like, who is sponsoring this activity. Who has sanctioned it.\nThis is good. This is excellent.\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   165 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

The assistant director reaches for the handset, \nsays \u201cSylvie\u201d into it, listens awhile, then sets it down. The woman enters with a ring of keys. From a drawer inside the assistant director\u2019s desk, she produces another key on a chain. Simple, elegant, long-shafted.\nA small locked door at the back of the main-floor gallery. It takes \ntwo keys to open it, and the assistant director seems inexperienced with the lock. They lead von Rumpel down a corkscrewing stone stair-case; at the bottom, the assistant director unlocks a second gate. They wind through warrens of hallways, past a warder who drops his news-paper and sits ramrod straight as they pass. In an unassuming store-room filled with dropcloths and pallets and crates, behind a sheet of plywood, the mineralogist reveals a simple combination safe that the assistant director opens rather easily.\nNo alarms. Only the one guard.Inside the safe is a second, far more interesting box. It is heavy \nenough that it requires both the assistant director and the mineralogist to lift it out.\nElegant, its joinery invisible. No brand name, no combination dial. \nIt is presumably hollow but with no discernible hinges, no nails, no attachment points; it looks like a solid block of highly polished wood. Custom work.\nThe mineralogist fits a key into a tiny, almost invisible hole on the \nbottom; when it turns, two more tiny keyholes open on the opposite side. The assistant director inserts matching keys into those holes; they unlock what looks like five different shafts.\nThree overlapping cylinder locks, each dependent on the next.\u201cIngenious,\u201d whispers von Rumpel.The entire box falls gently open.\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   179 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

It needs to be quickly retuned to transmit on multiple frequencies, the little doctor says, and it needs to be able to measure the angle of the transmissions it receives. Can Werner manage this?\nHe reconfigures nearly everything in the design.

Others in other ways.\u201dThe commadant\u2019s lips thin and his eyes narrow and an expression of \nslow and intense malice rises in his face. As though a cloud has drifted away and for a moment Bastian\u2019s true, deformed character has come glaring through. He pulls the hose from around his neck and hands it to R\u00f6del.\nR\u00f6del blinks up at his bulk. \u201cGo on, then,\u201d prods Bastian. In some \nother context, he might be encouraging a reluctant boy to step into cold water. \u201cDo him some good.\u201d\nR\u00f6del looks down at the hose: black, three feet long, stiff in the \ncold. What might be several seconds pass, though they feel to Wer-ner like hours, and the wind tears through the frosted grass, sending zephyrs and wisps of snow sirening off across the white, and a sud-den nostalgia for Zollverein rolls through him in a wave: boyhood afternoons wandering the soot-stained warrens, towing his little sister in the wagon. Muck in the alleys, the hoarse shouts of work crews, the boys in their dormitory sleeping head to toe while their coats and trousers hang from hooks along the walls.

Six more times he hears R\u00f6del swing and the hose whistle and the strangely dead smack of the rubber striking Frederick\u2019s hands, shoulders, and face.\nFrederick can walk for hours in the woods, can identify warblers \nfifty yards away simply by hearing their song. Frederick hardly ever thinks of himself. Frederick is stronger than he is in every imaginable way. Werner opens his mouth but closes it again; he drowns; he shuts his eyes, his mind.\nAt some point the beating stops. Frederick is facedown in the snow.\u201cSir?\u201d says R\u00f6del, panting.

In \nthe tumult of the kitchen, she cannot find a can opener, but she does find a paring knife in Madame Manec\u2019s knife drawer and the large coarse brick Madame used to prop open the fireplace grate.\nShe will eat whatever is inside one of the two cans. Then she will \nwait a bit longer in case her uncle comes home, in case she hears any-one pass by, the town crier, a fireman, an American serviceman with gallantry on his mind. If she hears no one by the time she is hungry again, she will go out into what is left of the street.\nFirst she climbs to the third floor to drink from the bathtub. With \nher lips against its surface, she takes long inward pulls. Pooling, bur-bling in her gut. A trick she and Etienne have learned over a hundred \nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   212 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

She braces one of the cans between her thighs, holds the point of the knife against its lid, and raises the brick to tap down on the knife handle. But before she can bring the brick down, the trip wire behind her jerks, and the bell rings, and someone enters the house.\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   213 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

His face \npresents a map of purples and yellows. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come to Ber-lin? Father will be working, but you could meet Mother.\u201d\nFor two weeks Frederick has limped around bruised and slow-\nfooted and puffy, and not once has he spoken to Werner with anything more than his own gentle brand of distracted kindness. Not once has he accused Werner of betrayal, even though Werner did nothing while Frederick was beaten and has done nothing since: did not hunt down R\u00f6del or point a rifle at Bastian or bang indignantly on Dr. Haupt-mann\u2019s door, demanding justice. As if Frederick understands already that both have been assigned to their specific courses, that there is no deviating now.\nWerner says, \u201cI don\u2019t have\u2014\u201d\u201cMother will pay your fare.\u201d Frederick tilts back up and stares at the \nceiling. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d\nThe train ride is a sleepy six-hour epic, every hour their rickety car \nshunted onto a siding to let trains full of soldiers, headed for the front, hurry past. Finally Werner and Frederick disembark at a dim charcoal-colored station and climb a long flight of stairs, each step painted with the same exclamation\u2014Berlin smokes Junos!\u2014and rise into the streets of the largest city Werner has ever seen.\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   217 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

Capital of sci-\nence, seat of the f\u00fchrer, nursery to Bohr, Einstein, Staudinger, Bayer. \nSomewhere in these streets, plastic was invented, X-rays were dis-covered, continental drift was identified. What marvels does science cultivate here now? Superman soldiers, Dr. Hauptmann says, and weather-making machines and missiles that can be steered by men a thousand miles away.\nThe sky drops silver threads of sleet. Gray houses run in converging \nlines to the horizon, bunched as if to fend off cold. They pass shops stuffed with hanging meats and a drunk with a broken mandolin on his lap and a trio of streetwalkers huddled beneath an awning who catcall the boys in their uniforms.\nFrederick leads them into a five-story town house one block off a \npretty avenue called the Knesebeckstrasse. He rings #2 and a return-ing buzz echoes from inside and the door unlatches. They come into a dim foyer and stand before a pair of matched doors. Frederick presses a button and something high in the building rattles and Werner whis-pers, \u201cYou have an elevator?\u201d\nFrederick smiles. The machinery clangs downward and the lift \nclanks into place and Frederick pushes the wooden doors inward. Werner watches the interior of the building slide past in amazement. When they reach the second floor, he says, \u201cCan we ride it again?\u201d\nFrederick laughs. They go down. Back up. Down, up, to the lobby \na fourth time, and Werner is peering into the cables and weights above the car, trying to understand its mechanism, when a tiny woman enters the building and shakes out her umbrella. With her other hand, she carries a paper sack, and her eyes rapidly apprehend the boys\u2019 uni-forms and the intense whiteness of Werner\u2019s hair and the livid bruises beneath Frederick\u2019s eyes. On the breast of her coat, a mustard-yellow star has been carefully stitched. Perfectly straight, one vertex down, another up. Drops fall like seeds from the tip of her umbrella.\n\u201cGood afternoon, Frau Schwartzenberger,\u201d says Frederick. He backs \nup against the wall of the elevator car and gestures for her to enter.\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   218 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

Her collar, he can see, is \nseparating from the rest of the coat; threads are giving way. If she were to turn, their eyes would be a hand\u2019s width apart.\nFrederick presses 2, then 5. No one speaks. The old woman rubs the \ntrembling tip of an index finger across one eyebrow. The lift clangs up one floor. Frederick snaps open the cage and Werner follows him out. He watches the old woman\u2019s gray shoes rise past his nose. Already the door to #2 is opening, and an aproned woman with baggy arms and a downy face rushes out and embraces Frederick. She kisses him on both cheeks, then touches his bruises with her thumbs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Franny, horseplay.\u201dThe apartment is sleek and shiny, full of deep carpets that swallow \nnoise. Big rear windows look out into the hearts of four leafless lin-dens. Sleet still falling outside.\n\u201cMother isn\u2019t home yet,\u201d Franny says, smoothing down her apron \nwith both palms. Her eyes stay on Frederick. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d\nFrederick says, \u201cOf course,\u201d and together he and Werner pad into \na warm, clean-smelling bedroom and Frederick slides open a drawer, and when he turns around, he\u2019s wearing eyeglasses with black frames. He looks at Werner shyly. \u201cOh, come on, you didn\u2019t already know?\u201d\nWith his glasses on, Frederick\u2019s expression seems to ease; his face \nmakes more sense\u2014this, Werner thinks, is who he is. A soft-skinned boy in glasses with taffy-colored hair and the finest trace of a mustache needled across his lip. Bird lover. Rich kid.\n\u201cI barely hit anything in marksmanship.

The \nmaid named Franny emerges with a dark loaf and a round of cheese, and she smiles at Frederick as she sets it down. They talk about Christ-mas and how Frederick was sorry to miss it, and the maid passes out through a swinging door and returns with two white plates so delicate that they ring when she sets them down.\nWerner\u2019s mind reels: A lift! A Jewess! A maid! Berlin! They retreat into \nFrederick\u2019s bedroom, which is populated with tin soldiers and model airplanes and wooden crates full of comic books. They lie on their stom-achs and look at the garish panels, feeling the pleasure of being outside of school, glancing at each other now and then as if curious to learn whether their friendship will continue to exist in another place.\nFranny calls, \u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d and as soon as the door closes, Frederick \ntakes Werner by the arm into the living room and climbs a ladder built along tall hardwood shelves and slides aside a large wicker basket and, from behind it, brings down a huge book: two volumes enfolded in golden slipcovers, each as big as a crib mattress. \u201cHere.\u201d His voice glows; his eyes glow. \u201cThis is what I wanted to show you.\u201d\nInside are lush full-color paintings of birds. T wo white falcons \nswoop over each other, beaks open. A bloodred flamingo holds its black-tipped beak over stagnant water. Resplendent geese stand on a headland and peer into a heavy sky. Frederick turns the pages with both hands. Pipiry flycatcher. Buff-breasted merganser. Red-cockaded \nwoodpecker. Many of them larger in the book than in real life.\n\u201cAudubon,\u201d Frederick says, \u201cwas an American. Walked the swamps \nand woods for years, back when that whole country was just swamps and woods. He\u2019d spend all day watching one individual bird. Then he\u2019d shoot it and prop it up with wires and sticks and paint it. Probably knew more than any birder before or since. He\u2019d eat most of the birds after he painted them. Can you imagine?\u201d Frederick\u2019s voice trembles with ardency. Gazing up. \u201cThose bright mists and your gun on your shoulder and your eyes set firmly in your head?\u201d\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   220 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

And here was someone willing to tramp out into a \nwilderness brimming with the unknown and bring back paintings. A book not so much full of birds as full of evanescence, of blue-winged, trumpeting mysteries.\nHe thinks of the Frenchman\u2019s radio program, of Heinrich Hertz\u2019s \nPrinciples of Mechanics\u2014doesn\u2019t he recognize the thrill in Frederick\u2019s voice? He says, \u201cMy sister would love this.\u201d\n\u201cFather says we\u2019re not supposed to have it. Says we have to keep \nit hidden up there behind the basket because it\u2019s American and was printed in Scotland.

Frederick \nhurries the volumes back inside their slipcovers; he calls, \u201cMother?\u201d and a woman wearing a green ski suit with white stripes down the legs enters crying, \u201cFredde! Fredde!\u201d She embraces her son and holds him back with straight arms while she runs a fingertip over a mostly healed cut along his forehead. Frederick looks off over her shoulder with a trace of panic on his face. Is he afraid that she\u2019ll see he was looking at the forbidden book? Or that she\u2019ll be angry about his bruises? She does not say anything but merely stares at her son, tangled in thoughts Werner cannot guess, then remembers herself.\n\u201cAnd you must be Werner!\u201d The smile sweeps back onto her face. \n\u201cFrederick has written lots about you! Look at that hair! Oh, we adore guests.\u201d She climbs the ladder and restores the heavy Audubon vol-umes to their shelf one at a time, as though putting away something irritating. The three of them sit at the vast oak table and Werner thanks her for the train ticket and she tells a story about a man she \u201cran into just now, unbelievable really,\u201d who apparently is a famous tennis player and every now and then she reaches across and squeezes Frederick\u2019s forearm. \u201cYou would have been absolutely amazed,\u201d she says more than once, and Werner studies his friend\u2019s face to gauge whether or not he would have been amazed, and Franny returns to set out wine and more Rauchk\u00e4se and for an hour Werner forgets about Schulpforta, about Bastian and the black rubber hose, about the Jewess upstairs\u2014\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   221 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

Werner notices a girl in the corner, radiant, dancing by herself, throwing her face to the ceiling. Eyes closed. The food is rich, and every now and then Fred-erick\u2019s mother laughs, and Frederick absently touches the makeup on his face while his mother says, \u201cWell, Fredde has all the best there at that school, all the best,\u201d and seemingly every minute some new face comes along and kisses Frederick\u2019s mother on both cheeks and whis-pers in her ear.

He hears R\u00f6del swing the hose, the smack of it across Frederick\u2019s upflung palms. He hears the voices of the boys in his Kameradschaften back in Zollverein sing, Live faithfully, fight bravely, and die laughing. The bistro is overcrowded; everyone\u2019s mouths move too quickly; the woman talking to Frederick\u2019s mother is wearing a nauseating quantity of perfume; and in the watery light it seems suddenly as if the scarf trailing from the dancing girl\u2019s neck is a noose.\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   222 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

She loops \nher slender arm through his and talks to him in a low voice. Fredde this, Fredde that. The street is empty, the windows dead, the elec-tric signs switched off. Innumerable shops, millions sleeping in beds around them, and yet where are they all? As they reach Frederick\u2019s block, a woman in a dress, leaning against a building, bends over and vomits on the sidewalk.\nIn the town house, Frederick pulls on pajamas made of jelly-green \nsilk and folds his glasses on the nightstand and climbs barefoot into his brass childhood bed.

Everyone will file past and soak the prisoner with a bucket of water. Every man in the school.\nOne by one, they start. One by one, each instructor takes a full \nbucket from Volkheimer and flings its contents at the prisoner a few feet away.

Vertical creases appear between his eyes; he looks like someone trying to remember something vital.\nAmong the hunched instructors in their dark capes, Dr. Haupt-\nmann goes past, his gloved fingers pinching his collar around his throat. Hauptmann accepts his bucket and throws a sheet of water and doesn\u2019t linger to watch it land.\nThe water keeps coming. The prisoner\u2019s face empties.

Every night the moment returns to him: when he clasped that pear-shaped diamond between his thumb and forefinger, made huge by the lens of his loupe, and believed he held the one-hundred-and-thirty-three-carat Sea of Flames.\nHe stared into the stone\u2019s ice-blue interior, where miniature moun-\ntain ranges seemed to send back fire, crimsons and corals and violets, polygons of color twinkling and coruscating as he rotated it, and he almost convinced himself that the stories were true, that centuries ago a sultan\u2019s son wore a crown that blinded visitors, that the keeper of the diamond could never die, that the fabled stone had caromed down through the pegs of history and dropped into his palm.\nThere was joy in that moment\u2014triumph. But an unexpected fear \nmixed with it; the stone looked like something enchanted, not meant for human eyes. An object that, once looked at, could never be for-gotten.\nBut. Eventually reason won out. The joints of the diamond\u2019s fac-\nets were not quite as sharp as they should have been. The girdle just slightly waxy. More telling, the stone betrayed no delicate cracks, no pinpoints, not a single inclusion. A real diamond, his father used to say, \nis never entirely free of inclusions. A real diamond is never perfect.\nHad he expected it to be real? To be kept precisely where he wished \nit would be?

The museum would never have commissioned such a high-quality fake if they did not possess the real thing somewhere. Over the past weeks in Paris, in the hours between other tasks, he has narrowed a list of seven lapidaries to three, then to one: a half-Algerian named Dupont who came of age cutting opal. It appears Dupont was making money before the war by facet-ing spinels into false diamonds for dowagers and baronesses. Also for museums.\nOne February midnight, von Rumpel lets himself into Dupont\u2019s \nfastidious shop not far from Sacr\u00e9-Coeur. He examines a copy of Streeter\u2019s Precious Stones and Gems; drawings of cleavage panes; trigo-\nnometric charts used for faceting. When he finds several painstaking iterations of a mold that match exactly the size and pear-cut shape of the stone in the vault at the museum, he knows he has his man.\nAt von Rumpel\u2019s request, Dupont is furnished with forged food-\nration tickets. Now von Rumpel waits. He prepares his questions: Did you make other replicas? How many? Do you know who has them now?\nOn the last day of February 1941, a dapper little Gestapo man \ncomes to him with the news that the unwitting Dupont has tried to use the forged tickets. He has been arrested.

On the wall behind her, a painted wisteria vine frays into a tangled modernist spray of color that makes von Rumpel uneasy.\nDupont is cuffed to a cheap dining chair in the center of the room. \nHis face has the color and polish of tropical wood.

Thick hanks of rope. Slick globules of stranded polyps. Once a drowned sparrow. Her greatest pleasure is to walk to the north end of the beach at low tide and squat below an island that Madame Manec calls Le Grand B\u00e9 and let her fingers whisk around in the tidepools. Only then, with her toes and fingers in the cold sea, does her mind seem to fully leave her father; only then does she stop wondering how much of his letter was true, when he\u2019ll write again, why he has been imprisoned.

They clomp together through the narrow streets, Marie-Laure\u2019s hand on the back of Madame\u2019s apron, following the odors of her stews and cakes; in such moments Madame seems like a great moving wall of rosebushes, thorny and fragrant and crackling with bees.\nStill-warm bread to an ancient widow named Madame Blanchard. \nSoup to Monsieur Saget.

Who lost his nose, left ear, and eye to shellfire in the first war. Who wears an enameled copper mask over half his face.\nHarold Bazin loves to talk about the walls and warlocks and pirates \nof Saint-Malo. Over the centuries, he tells Marie-Laure, the city ram-parts have kept out bloodthirsty marauders, Romans, Celts, Norse-men. Some say sea monsters. For thirteen hundred years, he says, the walls kept out bloodthirsty English sailors who would park their ships offshore and launch flaming projectiles at the houses, who would try to burn everything and starve everybody, who would stop at nothing to kill them all.\n\u201cThe mothers of Saint-Malo,\u201d he says, \u201cused to tell their children: \nSit up straight.

She misses Papa, Paris, Dr. Geffard, the gardens, her books, her pinecones\u2014all are holes in her life. But over these past few weeks, her existence has become tol-erable.

Her fingers pass the ship-builder\u2019s sheds on the rue de Chartres, pass Madame Ruelle\u2019s bakery on the rue Robert Surcouf. In her imagination she hears the bakers sliding about on the flour-slick floor, moving in the way she imagines ice skaters must move, baking loaves in the same four-hundred-year-old oven that Monsieur Ruelle\u2019s great-great-grandfather used. Her fin-gers pass the cathedral steps\u2014here an old man clips roses in a garden; here, beside the library, Crazy Harold Bazin murmurs to himself as he peers with his one eye into an empty wine bottle; here is the con-vent; here\u2019s the restaurant Chez Chuche beside the fish market; here\u2019s Number 4 rue Vauborel, its door slightly recessed, where downstairs Madame Manec kneels beside her bed, shoes off, rosary beads slipping through fingers, a prayer for practically every soul in the city. Here, in a fifth-floor room, Etienne walks beside his empty shelves, trailing his fingers over the places where his radios once stood. And somewhere beyond the borders of the model, beyond the borders of France, in a place her fingers cannot reach, her father sits in a cell, a dozen of his whittled models on a windowsill, a guard coming toward him with what she wants very badly to believe is a feast\u2014quail and duck and stewed rabbit.

Dr. Hauptmann laughs. His pistol smokes, and he takes a long drink from his flask and passes it to Werner, and Werner puts it to his lips.

His face appears over the edge of the upper bunk, or his silhouette presses binoculars to the windowpane. Frederick: who did not die but did not recover. Broken jaw, cracked skull, brain trauma. No one was punished, no one questioned. A blue automobile came to the school and Freder-ick\u2019s mother got out and walked into the commandant\u2019s residence and emerged soon afterward, tilted against the weight of Frederick\u2019s duffel bag, looking very small.

The eyes of the most bullheaded boys radiate a shining determination: every ounce of their attention has been trained to ferret out weakness. They study Werner with suspicion when he returns from Hauptmann\u2019s lab. They do not trust that he\u2019s an orphan, that he\u2019s often alone, that his accent carries a whisper of the French he learned as a child.\nWe are a volley of bullets, sing the newest cadets, we are cannonballs. \nWe are the tip of the sword.\nWerner thinks of home all the time. He misses the sound of rain \non the zinc roof above his dormer; the feral energy of the orphans; the scratchy singing of Frau Elena as she rocks a baby in the parlor. The smell of the coking plant coming in under the dawn, the first reliable smell of every day. Mostly he misses Jutta: her loyalty, her obstinacy, the way she always seems to recognize what is right.\nThough in Werner\u2019s weaker moments, he resents those same quali-\nties in his sister. Perhaps she\u2019s the impurity in him, the static in his signal that the bullies can sense. Perhaps she\u2019s the only thing keep-ing him from surrendering totally. If you have a sister back home, you\u2019re supposed to think of her as a pretty girl in a propaganda poster: rosy-cheeked, brave, steadfast. She\u2019s whom you fight for. Whom you die for. But Jutta? Jutta sends letters that the school censor blacks out almost completely. She asks questions that should not be asked. Only Werner\u2019s affiliation with Dr. Hauptmann\u2014his privileged status as the favorite of the technical sciences professor\u2014keeps him safe. A com-pany in Berlin is producing their transceiver, and already some of their units are coming back from what Hauptmann calls \u201cthe field,\u201d blown apart or burned or drowned in mud or defective, and Werner\u2019s job is to rebuild them while Hauptmann talks into his telephone or writes req-uisitions for replacement parts or spends whole fortnights away from the school.\nWeeks pass without a letter to Jutta. Werner writes four lines, a \nsmattering of platitudes\u2014I am fine; I am so busy\u2014and hands it to the bunk master.

He sees circuits break apart and re-form. He sees Frederick staring into his book of birds; he sees the furor of the mines at Zoll-verein, the shunting cars, the banging locks, the trundling conveyors, smokestacks silting the sky day and night; he sees Jutta slashing back and forth with a lit torch as darkness encroaches from all sides.

Who would not be hon-ored to fall?

Racial purity, political \npurity\u2014Bastian speaks to a horror of any sort of corruption, and yet, Werner wonders in the dead of night, isn\u2019t life a kind of corruption? A child is born, and the world sets in upon it. Taking things from it, stuffing things into it. Each bite of food, each particle of light entering the eye\u2014the body can never be pure. But this is what the comman-dant insists upon, why the Reich measures their noses, clocks their hair color.\nThe entropy of a closed system never decreases.At night Werner stares up at Frederick\u2019s bunk, the thin slats, the \nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   276 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

Another new boy sleeps up there, Dieter \nFerdinand, a small muscular kid from Frankfurt who does everything he is told with a terrifying ferocity.\nSomeone coughs; someone else moans. A train sounds its lonesome \nwhistle somewhere out beyond the lakes. To the east, always the trains move to the east, beyond the rims of the hills; they go to the huge trod-den borderlands of the front. Even as he sleeps, the trains are moving. The catapults of history rattling past.\nWerner laces his boots and sings the songs and marches the marches, \nacting less out of duty than out of a timeworn desire to be dutiful. Bas-tian walks the rows of boys at their dinners. \u201cWhat\u2019s worse than death, boys?\u201d\nSome poor cadet is called to attention. \u201cCowardice!\u201d\u201cCowardice,\u201d agrees Bastian, and the boy sits while the comman-\ndant slogs forward, nodding to himself, pleased. Lately the comman-dant speaks more and more intimately of the f\u00fchrer and the latest thing\u2014prayers, petrol, loyalty\u2014that he requires. The f\u00fchrer requires trustworthiness, electricity, boot leather. Werner is beginning to see, approaching his sixteenth birthday, that what the f\u00fchrer really requires is boys. Great rows of them walking to the conveyor belt to climb on. Give up cream for the f\u00fchrer, sleep for the f\u00fchrer, aluminum for the f\u00fchrer.

Half-\npacked crates litter the floor. The hounds are nowhere to be seen. The little man paces, and it is not until Werner announces himself that Hauptmann stops. He looks as if he is slowly being engulfed by some-thing beyond his control. \u201cI have been called to Berlin. They want me to continue my work there.\u201d Hauptmann lifts an hourglass from a shelf and sets it in a crate, and his pale silver-tipped fingers hang in the air.\n\u201cIt will be as you dreamed, sir.

At a certain point on each circuit, he passes a storefront filled with undressed mannequins, and though he knows each time that it is merely a trick of the light, he cannot stop his eyes from seeing them as corpses strung up by wires.\nFinally he rings the bell for #2. No one buzzes down, and he notices \nfrom the nameplates that they are no longer in #2. Their name is  \non #5.\nHe rings. A returning buzz issues from inside.The lift is out of order, so he walks up.The door opens. Franny. With the downy face and swinging flaps \nof skin under her arms. She gives him a look that one trapped per-son gives another; then Frederick\u2019s mother swishes out of a side room wearing tennis clothes. \u201cWhy, Werner\u2014\u201d\nShe loses herself momentarily in troubled reverie, surrounded by \nsleek furniture, some of it wrapped in thick wool blankets. Does she blame him? Does she think he is partially responsible? Perhaps he is? But then she comes awake and kisses him on both cheeks, and her bot-tom lip quivers lightly. As if his materialization is preventing her from keeping certain shadows at bay.\n\u201cHe won\u2019t know you. Don\u2019t try to make him remember.

Show him in, Franny.\u201d\nThe maid leads him into a grand drawing room, its ceilings aswirl \nwith plaster flourishes, its walls painted a delicate eggshell blue. No paintings have been hung yet and the shelves wait empty and card-board boxes stand open on the floor. Frederick sits at a glass-topped table at the back of the room, both table and boy looking small amid the clutter. His hair has been combed hard to one side, and his loose cotton shirt has bunched up behind his shoulders so that his collar is skewed. His eyes do not rise to meet his visitor\u2019s.\nHe wears his same old black-framed glasses. Someone has been \nfeeding him, and the spoon rests on the glass table and blobs of por-ridge cling to Frederick\u2019s whiskers and his place mat, which is a woolen thing featuring happy pink-cheeked children in clogs. Werner cannot look at it.\nFranny bends and pushes three more spoonfuls into Frederick\u2019s \nmouth and wipes his chin, folds up his place mat, and walks through a swinging door into what must be a kitchen. Werner stands with his hands crossed in front of his belt.\nOne year. More than that. Frederick has to shave now, Werner real-\nizes. Or someone has to shave him.\n\u201cHello, Frederick.\u201dFrederick rolls his head back and looks toward Werner through his \nsmudged lenses down the line of his nose.\n\u201cI\u2019m Werner. Your mother said you might not remember? I\u2019m your \nfriend from school.\u201d\nFrederick seems not so much to be looking at Werner as through \nhim. On the table is a stack of paper, on top of which a thick and clumsy spiral has been drawn by a heavy hand.\n\u201cDid you make this?\u201d Werner lifts the topmost drawing. Beneath \nthat page is another, then another, thirty or forty spirals, each taking up a whole sheet, all in the same severe lead. Frederick drops his chin to his chest, possibly a nod. Werner glances around: a trunk, a box of linens, the pale blue of the walls and the rich white of the wainscot. \nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   295 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

He was old; he was old all my life. But now he seemed especially old. It took him forever just to cross his kitchen. He had a package of cookies, little almond cookies. He put them out on a plate, just the package lying crosswise. Neither of us ate any. He said, \u2018You don\u2019t have to stay. I\u2019d like you to stay, but you don\u2019t have to. You probably have things to do.

The color of the arms displayed under the corporal\u2019s shoul-der straps and collar tabs is wine-red, but Werner can\u2019t remember what that is supposed to signify. Armored infantry? Chemical warfare? The old frau collects the plates. Neumann T wo removes a small tin from his coat, dumps three round pills on the table, and gulps them down. Then he puts the tin back inside his coat and looks at Werner. \u201cBackache pills. You have money?\u201d\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   317 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

Before they leave, he asks the frau to \nbring a dozen hard-boiled eggs and hands Werner four.\nFrom Schulpforta they ride a train through Leipzig and disembark \nat a switching station west of Lodz. Soldiers from an infantry battalion lie along the platform, all of them asleep, as though some enchant-ress has cast a spell over them. Their faded uniforms look spectral in the dimness, and their breathing seems synchronized, and the effect is ghostly and unnerving. Now and then a loudspeaker mutters destina-tions Werner has never heard of\u2014Grimma, Wurzen, Grossenhain\u2014though no trains come or go, and the men do not stir.\nNeumann T wo sits with his legs spread and eats eggs one after \nanother, piling the shells into a tower inside his upturned cap. Dusk falls. A soft, tidal snoring issues from the sleeping company. Werner feels as though he and Neumann T wo are the only souls awake in the world.\nWell after dark, a whistle sounds in the east and the drowsing sol-\ndiers stir. Werner comes out of a half dream and sits up. Neumann T wo is already upright beside him, palms cupped against each other, as though attempting to hold a sphere of darkness in the bowl of his hands.\nCouplings rattle, brake blocks grind against wheels, and a train \nemerges from the gloom, moving fast. First comes a blacked-out loco-motive, bolted over with armor, exhaling a thick geyser of smoke and steam. Behind the locomotive rumble a few closed cars and then a machine gun in a blister, two gunners crouching beside it.\nAll of the cars following the gunners\u2019 car are flatcars loaded with \npeople. Some stand; more kneel. T wo cars pass, three, four. Each car appears to have a wall of sacks along the front to serve as windbreak.\nThe rails below the platform shine dully as they bounce beneath the \nweight. Nine flatcars, ten, eleven. All full. The sacks, as they pass, seem strange: they look as though they have been sculpted out of gray clay.

Many \nsit with their backs against the sacks at the front of the car: they look like scarecrows shipping west to be staked in some terrible garden. Some of the prisoners, Werner sees, are sleeping.\nA face flashes past, pale and waxy, one ear pressed to the floor of \nthe car.\nWerner blinks. Those are not sacks. That is not sleep. Each car has \na wall of corpses stacked in the front.\nOnce it becomes clear that the train will not stop, all the soldiers \naround them settle and close their eyes once more. Neumann T wo yawns. Car after car the prisoners come, a river of human beings pour-ing out of the night. Sixteen seventeen eighteen: why count? Hun-dreds and hundreds of men. Thousands. Eventually from the darkness rushes a final flatcar where again the living recline on the dead, fol-lowed by the shadow of another gun in a blister and four or five gun-ners and then the train is gone.\nThe sound of the axles fades; silence seals itself back over the for-\nest.

He shuts down the saw and wriggles through the raw hole, up the ladder behind it, and into the garret. She follows. All morning Etienne crawls along the attic floor with cables and pliers and tools her fingers do not understand, weaving himself into the center of what she imagines as an intricate electronic net. He murmurs to himself; he fetches thick booklets or electrical components from various rooms on the lower stories. The attic creaks; \nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   321 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

For miles, out \nthe open door, Werner sees no sign of humans save the occa-\nsional railcar capsized beside the tracks, twisted and scarred by some kind of explosion. Soldiers clamber on and off, lean, pale, each car-rying a pack, rifle, and steel helmet. They sleep despite noise, despite cold, despite hunger, as though desperate to stay removed from the waking world for as long as possible.\nRows of pines divide endless metal-colored plains. The day is sun-\nless.

It\u2019s nearly dark when Werner is delivered to a mus-clebound captain dining alone on a sofa that consists of a wooden frame and springs.

Dented gasoline cans are strapped to one flank. Bul-let trails have left wandering perforations down the other. The leaden dusk drains away. Neumann T wo brings Werner a kerosene lantern. \u201cGadgets are inside.\u201d\nThen he vanishes. No explanations. Welcome to war. Tiny moths \nswirl in the lantern light. Fatigue settles into every part of Werner. Is this Dr. Hauptmann\u2019s idea of a reward or a punishment? He longs to sit on the benches in Children\u2019s House again, to hear Frau Elena\u2019s songs, to feel the heat pumping off the potbelly stove and the high voice of Siegfried Fischer rhapsodizing about U-boats and fighter planes, to see Jutta drawing at the far end of the table, sketching out the thousand windows of her imaginary city.\nInside the truck box lives a smell: clay, spilled diesel mixed with \nsomething putrid. Three square windows reflect the lantern light. It\u2019s a radio truck. On a bench along the left wall sit a pair of grimy listening decks the size of bed pillows. A folding RF antenna that can be raised and lowered from inside. Three headsets, a weapon rack, storage lock-ers. Wax pencils, compasses, maps. And here, in battered cases, wait two of the transceivers he designed with Dr. Hauptmann.\nTo see them all the way out here soothes him, as though he has \nturned and found an old friend floating beside him in the middle of the sea. He tugs the first transceiver from its case and unscrews the back plate. Its meter is cracked, several fuses are blown, and the trans-mitter plug is missing. He fishes for tools, a socket key, copper wire. He looks out the open door across the silent camp to where stars are spun in thousands across the sky.\nDo Russian tanks wait out there? T raining their guns on the lantern \nlight?\nHe remembers Herr Siedler\u2019s big walnut Philco. Stare into the wires, \nconcentrate, assess.

Out here he doesn\u2019t know how or when or where or even if transmissions are being broadcast; out here he chases ghosts. All they do is expend gasoline driving past smoldering cottages and chewed-up artillery pieces and unmarked graves, while Volkheimer passes his giant hand over his close-cropped head, growing more uneasy by the day.

To lose their boots, Werner understands, means they will die. But Volkheimer stands and waits, big man against big man, and always the prisoner caves. He stands in his wrecked socks in the trampled snow and tries to make eye contact with the other prisoners, but none will look at him.

There, thinks Werner when he finds it again, there: a feeling like shutting your eyes and feel-ing your way down a mile-long thread until your fingernails find the tiny lump of a knot.\nSometimes days pass after hearing a first transmission before Wer-\nner snares the next; they present a problem to solve, something to wrap his mind around: better, surely, than fighting in some stinking, frozen trench, full of lice, the way the old instructors at Schulpforta fought in the first war. This is cleaner, more mechanical, a war waged through the air, invisibly, and the front lines are anywhere. Isn\u2019t there a \nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   344 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

And when April finally comes, reeking of sawdust and corpses, the canyon walls of snow give way while the ice on the roads remains stubbornly fixed, a luminous, internecine network of invasion: a record of the crucifixion of Russia.\nOne night they cross a bridge over the Dnieper with the domes and \nblooming trees of Kiev looming ahead and ash blowing everywhere and prostitutes bundled in the alleys. In a caf\u00e9, they sit two tables down from an infantryman not much older than Werner. He stares into a newspaper with twitching eyeballs and sips coffee and looks deeply surprised.

Someone has burglarized \nthe chalet of a prominent donor with ties to the Natural History Museum in Paris, and the burglar has been apprehended with a travel case stuffed with gems.\nHe waits a long time. The captain reviews the fingernails of his left \nhand, then his right, then his left again. Von Rumpel is feeling very weak tonight, queasy really; the doctor says the treatments are over, that they have made their assault on the tumor and now they must wait, but some mornings he cannot straighten after he finishes tying his shoes.\nA car arrives. The captain goes out to greet it. Von Rumpel watches \nthrough the window.\nFrom the backseat, two policemen produce a frail-looking man in \na beige suit with a perfect purple bruise around his left eye. Hands cuffed. A spattering of blood on his collar. As though he has just left off playing a villain in some movie. The policemen shepherd the prisoner inside while the captain removes a handbag from the car\u2019s trunk.\nVon Rumpel takes his white gloves from his pocket. The captain \ncloses his office door, sets the bag atop his desk, and pulls his blinds. Tilts the shade of his desk lamp.

Then he plucks out a false bottom followed by six velvet bundles.\nHe unwraps them one at a time. The first contains three gorgeous \npieces of beryl: pink, fat, hexagonal. Inside the second is a single clus-ter of aqua-colored Amazonite, gently striated with white. Inside the third is a pear-cut diamond.\nA thrill leaps into the tips of von Rumpel\u2019s fingers. From a pocket, \nthe captain withdraws a loupe, a look of naked greed blooming on his face. He examines the diamond for a long time, turning it this way and that. Through von Rumpel\u2019s mind sail visions of the F\u00fchrermu-seum, glittering cases, bowers beneath pillars, jewels behind glass\u2014and something else too: a faint power, like a low voltage, coming off  the stone. Whispering to him, promsing to erase his illness.\nFinally the captain looks up, the impress of his loupe a tight pink \ncircle around his eye. The lamplight sets a gleam on his wet lips. He places the jewel back on the towel.\nFrom the other side of the desk, von Rumpel picks up the diamond. \nJust the right weight. Cold in his fingers, even through the cotton of the gloves. Deeply saturated with blue at its edges.\nDoes he believe?Dupont has almost kindled a fire inside it. But with the lens to \nhis eye, von Rumpel can see that the stone is identical to the one he examined in the museum two years before. He sets the reproduction back on the desk.\n\u201cBut at the minimum,\u201d the captain says in French, his face falling, \n\u201cwe must X-ray it, no?\u201d\n\u201cDo whatever you\u2019d like, by all means.

And her shoes pinch; she takes to wearing three pairs of socks and a big pair of Etienne\u2019s old tasseled loafers.\nThe rumors are that only essential personnel and those with medi-\ncal reasons will be allowed to stay in Saint-Malo. \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving,\u201d says Etienne. \u201cNot when we might finally be doing some good.

Regardless, the fever comes, and with it terrible diarrhea, and as Werner crouches in the mud behind the Opel, he feels as if he is shitting out the last of his civilization. Whole hours pass during which he can do no more than press his cheek against the wall of the truck shell seeking something cold. Then the shivers take over, hard and fast, and he cannot warm his body; he wants to leap into a fire.\nVolkheimer offers coffee; Neumann T wo offers the tablets that Wer-\nner knows by now are not for backaches.

He salvages the inferior Soviet equipment, milled from marginal steel, clumsily soldered; it\u2019s all so unsystematic. How can they fight a war with such lousy equipment?

They are ragtag desperadoes with nothing to lose.\nAnd it seems he can never make headway into understanding which \ntheory is closer to the truth.

The smoking, ruined villages, the broken pieces of brick in the street, the frozen corpses, the shattered walls, the upturned cars, the barking dogs, the scurrying rats and lice: how can they live like that? Out here in the forests, in the mountains, in the villages, they are supposed to be pulling up disorder by the root. The total entropy of any system, said Dr. Hauptmann, will decrease only if the entropy of another system will increase. Nature demands symmetry. Ordnung muss sein.\nAnd yet what order are they making out here? The suitcases, the \nqueues, the wailing babies, the soldiers pouring back into the cities with eternity in their eyes\u2014in what system is order increasing? Surely not in Kiev, or Lvov, or Warsaw.

Then they\u2019re around a bend and he feels only the presence of Volkheimer next to him, a cold dusk out the windows, bridge after bridge, hill after hill, \nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   355 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

A peaceful place, insulated by fields, enwombed in hedges. He climbs a staircase to a library. A bookshelf has been peeled open; the strongbox is behind it.

Or at the front, \nlike everyone else.\nThe city commander has no time for them. A subordinate tells \nVolkheimer there are reports of resistance broadcasts washing out of the Leopoldstadt.

The place smells to him of carnage.\nFor five days he hears nothing on his transceiver but anthems \nand recorded propaganda and broadcasts from beleaguered colonels requesting supplies, gasoline, men. It is all unraveling, Werner can feel it; the fabric of the war tearing apart.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the Staatsoper,\u201d says Neumann T wo one night. The facade \nof a grand building rises gracefully, pilastered and crenelated. Stately wings soar on either side, somehow both heavy and light.

They would all do \nbetter to put their faces on the curbs and wait for the boys who come through the city dragging sledges stacked with corpses.\nAt midmorning Volkheimer orders them to park in the Augar-\nten. The sun burns away the fog and reveals the first blooms on the trees. Werner can feel the fever flickering inside him, a stove with its door latched. Neumann One, who, if he were not scheduled to die ten weeks from now in the Allied invasion of Normandy, might have become a barber later in life, who would have smelled of talc and whis-key and put his index finger into men\u2019s ears to position their heads, whose pants and shirts always would have been covered with clipped hairs, who, in his shop, would have taped postcards of the Alps around the circumference of a big cheap wavery mirror, who would have been faithful to his stout wife for the rest of his life\u2014Neumann One says, \u201cTime for haircuts.\u201d\nHe sets a stool on the sidewalk and throws a mostly clean towel over \nBernd\u2019s shoulders and snips away.

Neumann One cuts Bernd\u2019s hair, then Werner\u2019s, then pouchy, wrecked Neumann T wo\u2019s. Werner watches Volkheimer climb onto the stool and close his eyes when a particularly plangent waltz comes on, Volkheimer who has killed a hundred men by now at least, probably more, walking into pathetic radio-transmitting shacks in his huge expropriated boots, sneaking up behind some emaciated Ukrainian with headphones on his ears and a microphone at his lips and shooting him in the back of the head, then going to the truck to tell Werner to collect the transmitter, making the order calmly, sleep-ily, even with the pieces of the man on the transmitter like that.\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   365 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

That afternoon, long after the stool has been put away and the waltzes have stopped, while Werner sits with his transceiver listening to nothing, a little redheaded girl in a maroon cape emerges from a doorway, maybe six or seven years old, small for her age, with big clear eyes that remind him of Jutta\u2019s. She runs across the street to the park and plays there alone, beneath the budding trees, while her mother stands on the corner and bites the tips of her fingers. The girl climbs into the swing and pendulums back and forth, pump-ing her legs, and watching her opens some valve in Werner\u2019s soul. This is life, he thinks, this is why we live, to play like this on a day when winter is finally releasing its grip. He waits for Neumann T wo to come around the truck and say something crass, to spoil it, but he doesn\u2019t, and neither does Bernd, maybe they don\u2019t see her at all, maybe this one pure thing will escape their defilement, and the girl sings as she swings, a high song that Werner recognizes, a counting song that girls jumping rope in the alley behind Children\u2019s House used to sing, Eins, \nzwei, Polizei, drei, vier, Offizier, and how he would like to join her, push her higher and higher, sing f\u00fcnf, sechs, alte Hex, sieben, acht, gute Nacht! Then her mother calls something Werner cannot hear and takes the girl\u2019s hand. They pass around a corner, little velvet cape trailing behind, and are gone.\nNot an hour later, he snares something winging in out of the static: \na simple broadcast in Swiss German. Hit nine, transmitting at 1600, this is KX46, do you receive? He does not understand all of it. Then it goes. Werner crosses the square and tunes the second transceiver him-self. When they speak again, he triangulates and plugs the numbers into the equation, then looks up and sees with his naked eyes what looks very much like a wire antenna trailing down the side of an apart-ment house flanking the square.\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   366 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

But most of the countries had cut down their big trees. En-gland, Great-Grandfather said, didn\u2019t have a tree worth its wood on the whole island. So the masts for the British and Spanish navies, the Portuguese too, would come from Prussia, from the woods where I grew up. Great-Grandfather knew where all the giants were. Some of those trees would take a crew of five men three days to bring down. First the wedges would go in, like needles, he said, in the hide of an elephant. The biggest trunks could swallow a hundred wedges before they\u2019d creak.\u201d\nThe artillery screams; the cellar shudders.\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   388 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

That chunk of coal was once a green plant, a fern or reed that lived one million years ago, or maybe two million, or maybe one hundred million. Can you imagine one hundred million years?\nWerner says, \u201cWhere I\u2019m from, they dug up trees.

A world of wildflowers blooming up through the shapes of rusty cast-off parts. A world of berries and carrot peels and Frau Elena\u2019s fairy tales.

The beaches are devouring \nmen\u2014Americans, Canadians, Brits, Germans, Russians\u2014and all through Normandy, heavy bombers pulverize country towns.

They are huge, stacked in rows of twenty and thirty along each block. Not even Berlin had chimneys like that.\nOf course. The Frenchman must be using a chimney.He hurries down through the lobby and paces the rue des Forgeurs, \nthen the rue de Dinan. Staring up at shutters, gutter lines, looking for cables bracketed to bricks, anything that might give the transmitter away. He walks up and down until his neck aches. He has been gone too long. He will be upbraided. Volkheimer already senses something amiss. But then, right at 2300 hours, Werner sees it, hardly one block from where they parked the Opel: an antenna sliding up alongside a chimney. Not much wider than a broomstick.\nIt rises perhaps twelve meters and then unfolds as if by magic into \na simple T .\nA high house on the edge of the sea. A spectacularly good location \nfrom which to broadcast. From street level, the antenna is all but invis-ible. He hears Jutta\u2019s voice: I bet he does these broadcasts from a huge mansion, big as this whole colony, a place with a thousand rooms and a thousand servants. The house is tall and narrow, eleven windows in its facade. Splotched with orange lichen, its foundation furred with moss.

Blue trim on the windows. \nThe morning fog is so dense that he cannot see the roofline. He enter-tains pipe dreams: the Frenchman will invite him in. They\u2019ll drink coffee, discuss his long-ago broadcasts. Maybe they\u2019ll investigate some important empirical problem that has been troubling him for years. Maybe he\u2019ll show Werner the transmitter.\nLaughable. If Werner rings the bell, the old man will assume he\u2019s \nbeing arrested as a terrorist. That he might be shot where he stands. The antenna on the chimney in itself is cause for execution.\nWerner could bang on the door, march the old man away. He \nwould be a hero.\nThe mist begins to suffuse with light. Somewhere, someone opens a \ndoor and closes it again. Werner remembers how Jutta would write her letters in a flurry and scribble The Professor, France on the envelope and drop them into the mailbox in the square. Imagining her voice might find his ear as his had found hers. One in ten million.\nAll night he has practiced the French in his head: Avant la guerre. \nJe vous ai entendu \u00e0 la radio. He will keep his rifle over his shoulder, hands at his sides; he will look small, elfin, no threat at all. The old man will be startled, but his fear will be manageable. He\u2019ll listen. But as Werner stands in the slowly dispersing fog at the end of the rue Vauborel, rehearsing what he\u2019ll say, the front door of Number 4 opens, and out steps not an eminent old scientist but a girl. A slender, pretty, auburn-haired girl with a very freckled face, in glasses and a gray dress, carrying a knapsack over one shoulder. She heads to her left, making directly for him, and Werner\u2019s heart twists in his chest.\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   411 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

Already she is twenty paces away. \nNo one seems to be watching; all the curtains are drawn. Fifteen paces away. Her stockings have runs in them and her shoes are too large and the woolen panels of her dress are mottled with stains. Ten paces, five. She passes within arm\u2019s reach, her head slightly higher than his own. Without thinking, hardly understanding what he\u2019s doing, Werner fol-lows. The tip of her cane shudders as it knocks against the runnels, finding every storm drain. She walks like a ballerina in dance slip-pers, her feet as articulate as hands, a little vessel of grace moving out into the fog. She turns right, then left, traverses half a block and steps neatly through the open door of a shop. A rectangular sign above it reads: Boulangerie.\nWerner stops. Above him, the mist gives way in shreds, and a deep \nsummer blue reveals itself. A woman waters flowers; an old traveler in gabardine walks a poodle. On a bench sits a goitrous and sallow Ger-man sergeant major with shadows carved under his eyes. He lowers his paper, stares directly at Werner, then raises his newspaper again.\nWhy are Werner\u2019s hands shaking? Why can\u2019t he catch his breath?The girl emerges from the bakery, steps neatly off the curbstone, \nand makes straight for him.

Already flames are licking the ceiling. The sergeant major loops one finger under his collar and pulls against its tightness. His face gaunt and his teeth maniacal. He sits on the bed. Starlight winks off the barrel of his pistol.\nAt the foot of the bed, Werner can just make out a low table upon \nwhich scaled-down wooden houses crowd together to form a city. Is it Saint-Malo?

Maybe it will go out on its own.\nWerner thinks about the men in the sunflowers and a hundred oth-\ners: each lay dead in his hut or truck or bunker, wearing the look of someone who had caught the tune of a familiar song. A crease between the eyes, a slackness to the mouth. A look that said: So soon? But doesn\u2019t it play for everybody too soon?\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   464 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

At first Werner worries they\u2019re taking him downstairs\u2014please, not another pit\u2014but he is brought to the third floor, where an exhausted interpreter who has been booking German prisoners for a month notes his name and rank, then asks a few rote questions while the clerk rifles through Wer-ner\u2019s canvas duffel and hands it back.\n\u201cA girl,\u201d Werner says in French, \u201cdid you see\u2014?\u201d but the interpreter \nonly smirks and says something to the clerk in English, as though every German soldier he has interviewed has asked about a girl.\nHe\u2019s ushered into a courtyard encircled with razor wire, where eight \nor nine other Germans sit in their high boots holding battered can-teens, one dressed in women\u2019s clothes in which he apparently tried to desert. T wo NCOs and three privates and no Volkheimer.\nAt night they serve soup in a cauldron, and he gulps down four \nhelpings from a tin cup. Five minutes later, he is sick in the corner. The soup won\u2019t stay down in the morning either. Shoals of clouds swim through the sky. His left ear admits no sound. He lingers over images of Marie-Laure\u2014her hands, her hair\u2014even as he worries that to concentrate on them too long is to risk wearing them out. A day after his arrest, he is marched east in a group of twenty to join a \nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   479 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

Through the open \ndoors, he cannot see Saint-Malo, but he hears the airplanes, hundreds of them, and a great pall of smoke hangs over the horizon day and night. T wice medics try giving Werner bowls of gruel, but it will not stay down. He\u2019s been able to keep nothing in his stomach since the peaches.\nMaybe his fever is returning; maybe the sludge they drank in the \nhotel cellar has poisoned him. Maybe his body is giving up. If he does not eat, he understands, he will die. But when he does eat, he feels as if he will die.\nFrom the warehouse, they are marched to Dinan. Most of the pris-\noners are boys or middle-aged men, the shattered remains of compa-nies. They carry ponchos, duffels, crates; a few tote brightly colored suitcases claimed from who knows where. Among them walk pairs of men who fought side by side, but most are strangers to one another, and all have seen things they wish to forget. Always there is the sense of a tide behind them, rising, gathering mass, carrying with it a slow and vindictive rage.\nHe walks in the tweed trousers of Marie-Laure\u2019s great-uncle; over \nhis shoulder, he carries his duffel. Eighteen years old. All his life his schoolmasters, his radio, his leaders talked to him about the future. And yet what future remains? The road ahead is blank, and the lines of his thoughts all incline inward: he sees Marie-Laure disappear down the street with her cane like ash blown out of a fire, and a feeling of longing crashes against the underside of his ribs.\nOn the first of September, Werner cannot get to his feet when he \nwakes. T wo of his fellow prisoners help him to the bathroom and back, then lay him in the grass. A young Canadian in a medic\u2019s helmet shines a penlight into Werner\u2019s eyes and loads him into a truck, and he is driven some distance and set in a tent full of dying men. A nurse puts fluid into his arm. Spoons a solution into his mouth.\nFor a week he lives in the strange greenish light beneath the canvas \nof that huge tent, his duffel clutched in one hand and the hard corners \nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   480 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

He sees a submarine asleep in the lightless depths of the Atlantic; Jutta presses her face to a porthole and breathes on the glass. He half expects to see Volkheimer\u2019s huge hand appear, help him up, and clap him into the Opel.\nAnd Marie-Laure? Can she still feel the pressure of his hand against \nthe webbing between her fingers as he can feel hers?\nOne night he sits up. In cots around him are a few dozen sick or \nwounded. A warm September wind pours across the countryside and sets the walls of the tent rippling.\nWerner\u2019s head swivels lightly on his neck. The wind is strong and \ngusting stronger, and the corners of the tent strain against their guy ropes, and where the flaps at the two ends come up, he can see trees buck and sway. Everything rustles. Werner zips his old notebook and the little house into his duffel and the man beside him murmurs ques-tions to himself and the rest of the ruined company sleeps. Even Wer-ner\u2019s thirst has faded. He feels only the raw, impassive surge of the moonlight as it strikes the tent above him and scatters. Out there, \nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   481 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

Jutta painted the vessel in ecstatic purples and greens, and she set it on the water with great formality. But the boat sagged as soon as the current got hold of it. It floated downstream, out of reach, and the flat black water swallowed it. Jutta blinked at Werner with wet eyes, pulling at the battered loops of yarn in her sweater.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he told her. \u201cThings hardly ever work on the first try. \nWe\u2019ll make another, a better one.\u201d\nDid they?

Unscrewing, sawing, hauling. Most days Frau Elena works close by, wearing a torn ski jacket she has found, mumbling to herself in French or singing songs from childhood.\nThey live above a printing company abandoned a month before. \nHundreds of crates of misprinted dictionaries are stacked in the halls, and the girls burn them page by page in the potbelly stove.\nYesterday Dankeswort, Dankesworte, Dankgebet, Dankopfer.\nToday Frauenverband, Frauenverein, Frauenvorsteher, Frauenwahl-\nrecht.\nFor meals they have cabbage and barley in the factory canteen at \nnoon, endless ration lines in the evening. Butter is cut into tiny por-tions: three times a week, they each get a square half the size of a sugar cube. Water comes from a spigot two blocks away. Mothers with infants have no baby clothes, no buggies, and very little cow\u2019s milk. Some tear apart bedsheets for diapers; a few find newspapers and fold those into triangles and pin them between their babies\u2019 legs.\nAt least half of the girls working in the factory cannot read or write, \nso Jutta reads them the letters that come from boyfriends or brothers or fathers at the front.

Most nights the girls hurry to \nthe end of the block and climb into a cramped shelter and are kept awake by the crashing of stonework.\nOnce in a while, on the walk to the factory, they see bodies, mum-\nmies turned to ash, people scorched beyond recognition. Other times, the corpses bear no apparent injuries, and it is these that fill Jutta with dread: people who look like they are a moment away from rising up and slogging back to work with the rest of them.\nBut they do not wake.Once she sees a row of three children facedown, backpacks on their \nbacks. Her first thought is: Wake up. Go to school. Then she thinks: There could be food in those packs.\nClaudia F\u00f6rster stops talking. Whole days pass and she does not say \na word. The factory runs out of materials. There are rumors that no one is in charge anymore, that the copper and zinc and stainless steel they\u2019ve been slaving to collect is being loaded onto train cars and left on sidings for no one.\nMail stops. In late March, the machine parts factory is padlocked, \nand Frau Elena and the girls are sent to work for a civilian firm clean-ing the streets after bombings. They lift broken masonry blocks, shovel dust and shattered glass through strainers.

Jutta comes home one afternoon, pasted with dust, to discover that big Claudia F\u00f6rster has chanced upon a paper bakery box sealed with gold tape. Blots of grease show through the cardboard. Together the girls stare at it. Like something from the unfallen world.\nInside wait fifteen pastries, separated by squares of wax paper and \nstuffed with strawberry preserves. The four girls and Frau Elena sit in their dripping apartment, a spring rain over the city, all the ash run-ning off the ruins, all the rats peering out of caves made from fallen bricks, and they eat three stale pastries each, none of them saving any-thing for later, the powdered sugar on their noses, the jelly between their teeth, a giddiness rising and sparkling in their blood.\nThat cowlike, petrified Claudia could achieve such a miracle, that \nshe would be good enough to share it.\nWhat young women are left dress themselves in rags, cower in base-\nments.

The two boys, in particular, smell toxically of it. They seem partly like sheepish schoolboys and partly like lunatics with an hour left to live. The first has only a rope for a belt and is so thin, he does not have to unknot it to slide off his trousers. The second laughs: a strange, puzzled laugh, as if he does not quite believe the Germans would come to his country and leave a city like this behind. The officer sits by the door with his legs straight out in front of him and peers out into the street.

Everything is \nstrangely orderly. The officer goes last, trying each of them in turn, and he speaks single words while he is on top of Jutta, his eyes open but not seeing.

Then the three men spill into the street and Frau Elena zips herself into her ski parka, barefoot, rubbing her left arm with her right hand, as if trying to warm that one small segment of herself.\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   491 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

No children, no pets, no houseplants, few books on the shelves. Just a card table, a mattress, and a single armchair in front of the television where he now sits, a tin of butter cookies in his lap.

Sometimes, in the slow heat of summer, long before dawn, Volkheimer paces in the harsh dazzle of the billboard lights and feels his loneliness on him like a disease. He sees tall ranks of firs swaying in a storm, hears their heartwood groan. He sees the earthen floor of his childhood home, and the spi-derwebbed light of dawn coming through conifers.

Every day she wears the same outfit: black slacks \nwith a nylon blouse\u2014alternately beige, charcoal, or pale blue. Occa-sionally the canary-yellow one, if she\u2019s feeling unrestrained. Her skin is milky and her hair remains white as paper.\nJutta\u2019s husband, Albert, is a kind, slow-moving, and balding accoun-\ntant whose great passion is running model trains in the basement. For a long time Jutta believed she could not get pregnant, and then, one day, when she was thirty-seven years old, she did. Their son, Max, is six, fond of mud, dogs, and questions no one can answer. More than anything lately, Max likes to fold complicated designs of paper airplanes. He comes home from school, kneels on the kitchen floor, and forms airplane after airplane with unswerving, almost frightening devotion, evaluating different wingtips, tails, noses, mostly seeming to love the praxis of it, the transformation of something flat into some-thing that can fly.\nIt\u2019s a Thursday afternoon in early June, the school year nearly over, \nand they are at the public swimming pool. Slate-colored clouds veil the sky, and children shout in the shallow end, and parents talk or read magazines or doze in their chairs, and everything is normal. Albert stands at the snack counter in his swim trunks, with his little towel draped over his wide back, and contemplates his selection of ice cream.\nMax swims awkwardly, windmilling one arm forward and then the \nother, periodically looking up to make sure his mother is watching. When he\u2019s done, he wraps himself in a towel and climbs into the chair beside her. Max is compact and small and his ears stick out. Water droplets shine in his eyelashes.

Albert puts on water for noodles and fries onions. Max takes a clean sheet of paper from the drawing table and starts to fold.\nOn the front door come knocks, three.For reasons Jutta does not fully understand, her heartbeat begins to \nthud in her ears. The point of her pencil hovers over the page. It\u2019s only someone at the door\u2014a neighbor or a friend or the little girl, Anna, from down the street, who sits upstairs with Max sometimes and gives him directions for how to best construct elaborate towns out of plastic blocks. But the knock does not sound anything like Anna\u2019s.\nMax bounds to the door, airplane in hand.\u201cWho is it, dear?\u201dMax does not reply, which means it is someone he does not know. \nShe crosses into the hall, and there in her door frame stands a giant.\nMax crosses his arms, intrigued and impressed. His airplane on the \nground at his feet. The giant takes off his cap. His massive head shines. \u201cFrau Wette?\u201d He wears a tent-sized silver sweatsuit with maroon splashes along the sides, zipper pulled to the base of his throat. Gin-gerly, he presents a faded canvas duffel bag.\nThe bullies in the square. Hans and Herribert. His very size invokes \nthem all.

Albert pulls the table away \nfrom the wall and sets a fourth place. In his wooden chair, Volkheimer reminds Jutta of an image from one of Max\u2019s picture books: an ele-phant squeezed into an airplane seat. The duffel bag he has brought waits on the hall table.\nThe conversation begins slowly.He has come several hours on the train.He walked here from the station.He does not need sherry, thank you.Max eats fast, Albert slowly.

Does not want to \nhear what this huge man has traveled a long way to say. Weeks go by when Jutta does not allow herself to think of the war, of Frau Elena, of the awful last months in Berlin. Now she can buy pork seven days a week. Now, if the house feels cold she twists a dial in the kitchen, and voil\u00e0. She does not want to be one of those middle-aged women \nwho thinks of nothing but her own painful history. Sometimes she looks at the eyes of her older colleagues and wonders what they did when the electricity was out, when there were no candles, when the rain came through the ceiling. What they saw. Only rarely does she loosen the seals enough to allow herself to think of Werner. In many ways, her memories of her brother have become things to lock away. A math teacher at Helmoltz-Gymnasium in 1974 does not bring up a brother who attended the National Political Institute of Education at Schulpforta.\nDoerr_AlltheLight_2P_jdh-es.indd   502 12/13/13   10:50 AM",

I think he might have fallen in love.\u201dJutta sits straighter in her chair. It\u2019s embarrassingly plain how inad-\nequate language is. A town on the northern coast of France? Love? Nothing will be healed in this kitchen. Some griefs can never be put right.\nVolkheimer pushes back from the table. \u201cIt was not my intention to \nupset you.\u201d He hovers, dwarfing them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d says Albert. \u201cMax, can you please take our guest to \nthe patio? I\u2019ll put out some cake.\u201d\nMax slides open the glass door for Volkheimer, and he ducks \nthrough. Jutta sets the plates in the sink. She is suddenly very tired. She only wants the big man to leave and to take the bag with him. She only wants a tide of normalcy to wash in and cover everything again.\nAlbert touches her elbow. \u201cAre you all right?\u201dJutta does not nod or shake her head, but slowly drags a hand over \nboth eyebrows.\n\u201cI love you, Jutta.\u201dWhen she looks out the window, Volkheimer is kneeling on the \ncement beside Max.

In the basement, Albert is running his trains through his meticulously painted world, beneath the underpass, over his electric drawbridge; it\u2019s a small sound up here, but relentless, a sound that penetrates the timbers of the house.\nJutta brings the duffel up to the desk in her bedroom and sets it \ndown on the floor and grades another of her students\u2019 exams.

She can hear the trains stop, then resume their monotonous drone.\nShe tries to grade a third exam but cannot concentrate; the num-\nbers drift across the pages and collect at the bottom in unintelligible piles.

By Rennes, the sun has dropped low over \nthe horizon, and the smell of warm manure comes through the open windows, and lines of pollarded trees whisk past. Gulls and crows in equal numbers follow a tractor through its wake of dust. Max eats a second ham sandwich and rereads a comic book, and sheets of yellow flowers glow in the fields, and Jutta wonders if any of them grow over the bones of her brother.\nBefore dark, a well-dressed man with a prosthetic leg boards the \ntrain. He sits beside her and lights a cigarette. Jutta clutches her bag between her knees; she is certain that he was wounded in the war, that he will try to start a conversation, that her deficient French will betray her. Or that Max will say something. Or that the man can already tell. Maybe she smells German.\nHe\u2019ll say, You did this to me.Please.

As a doctoral student, she traveled to Bora Bora and Bimini; she waded onto reefs in a sun hat with a collecting bucket and harvested snails on three continents.\nMarie-Laure is not a collector in the way that Dr. Geffard was, an \namasser, always looking to scurry down the scales of order, family, genus, species, and subspecies.

They met in graduate school; he flitted from lab to lab with a prodigious curiosity but little perseverance. He loved ocean currents and architecture and Charles Dickens, and his variousness made her feel limited, overspecialized. When Marie-Laure got pregnant, they separated peaceably, with no flamboyance.\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne, their daughter, is nineteen now. Short-haired, petite, an \naspiring violinist.

Marie-Laure still cannot wear shoes that are too large, or smell a boiled tur-nip, without experiencing revulsion. Neither can she listen to lists of names. Soccer team rosters, citations at the end of journals, introduc-tions at faculty meetings\u2014always they seem to her some vestige of the prison lists that never contained her father\u2019s name.\nShe still counts storm drains: thirty-eight on the walk home from \nher laboratory. Flowers grow on her tiny wrought-iron balcony, and in summer she can estimate what time of day it is by feeling how wide the petals of the evening primroses have opened. When H\u00e9l\u00e8ne is out with her friends and the apartment seems too quiet, Marie-Laure walks to the same brasserie: Le Village Monge, just outside the Jardin des Plantes, and orders roasted duck in honor of Dr. Geffard.\nIs she happy? For portions of every day, she is happy. When she\u2019s \nstanding beneath a tree, for instance, listening to the leaves vibrating in the wind, or when she opens a package from a collector and that old ocean odor of shells comes washing out.

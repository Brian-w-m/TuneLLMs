In Legal Studies, task words are words that tell you how to demonstrate the knowledge you have learned.\nTask words range in level of  dif\ufb01culty. Some (such as identify or de\ufb01ne) are simple to understand and \nmaster. Others (such as evaluate or justify) are more challenging to understand and will take practice \nto master. Source 2 lists a range of  common task words and their de\ufb01nitions. It also provides example \nquestions so you can see each task word in context.\nAll of  these questions have come from exam papers for past Study Designs, so they may or may not re\ufb02ect key \nknowledge and key skills that are not in the current Study Design. You should check with your teacher about this.TASK WORDDEFINITIONEXAMPLE QUESTION FROM PAST EXAMS\nDiscuss Give a reasoned argument for and \nagainst a particular issue (and \nprovide strengths and weaknesses if applicable).

As you work your way through the VCE Legal Studies course, you will be learning about many different \nlaws and legal cases. To be able to recognise laws and legal cases, and to reference them in your notes and assessment tasks, you should master the basics of  legal citation.  \n   W h a t  is legal citation?  \n   Legal citation  is the system used to refer to legal documents and \nsources such as cases and Acts of  parliament in a consistent and accurate way. The most commonly cited legal documents/uni00A0are:  \n   \u2022       Acts of parliament  (also known as  statutes  and \n legislation )   \n  \u2022      legal cases (also known as court decisions).    \n      \n  The following information will help you in reading \nand understanding legal citations. It will also help you \ncite legal documents correctly in your coursework and assessment/uni00A0tasks.     \n    C i t i n g  Acts of/uni00A0parliament  \n   Acts of parliament  (often called just \u2018 Acts\u2019) are laws made \nby the various parliaments in Australia (i.e. state and territory parliaments and the Commonwealth Parliament) and in other countries around the/uni00A0world.  \n  Acts of  parliament generally feature the following pieces of  \ninformation in this/uni00A0order:  \n   \u2022       The name of the Act or statute  \u2013 This is the title that has been \ngiven to the statute. It is always written in  italics .   \n  \u2022       The year that it was made by parliament  \u2013 This is also written \nin  italics .   \n  \u2022       The parliament that passed it \u2013  This will be either a state or territory parliament, or the \nCommonwealth Parliament. The name of  the parliament is never written in full; instead, abbreviations for each parliament are used (e.g. Vic or/uni00A0Cth).    \n   Example/uni00A01 \u2013 an/uni00A0Act made by/uni00A0the Victorian Parliament            \n      This Act (i.e. the  Crimes Act ) was made in 1958 by the Victorian Parliament.     \n   Example/uni00A02 \u2013 an/uni00A0Act made by/uni00A0the Commonwealth Parliament            \n      This Act (i.e. the  Competition and Consumer Act ) was made in 2010 by the Commonwealth Parliament.

In Legal Studies, task words are words that tell you how to demonstrate the knowledge you have learned.\nTask words range in level of  dif\ufb01culty. Some (such as identify or de\ufb01ne) are simple to understand and \nmaster. Others (such as evaluate or justify) are more challenging to understand and will take practice \nto master. Source 2 lists a range of  common task words and their de\ufb01nitions. It also provides example \nquestions so you can see each task word in context.\nAll of  these questions have come from exam papers for past Study Designs, so they may or may not re\ufb02ect key \nknowledge and key skills that are not in the current Study Design.

The fire \nburned for several days, resulting in toxic smoke and ash over the city. A number of nearby residents had to seek medical treatment and sleep elsewhere.\nFollowing the fire, it was reported that over 70 residents and business owners had joined a \nclass action, alleging that the operators of the recycling plant had acted negligently.CASE\nSTUDY\nLEGAL\nCASECheck your obook assess for these additional resources and more:\n\u00bb 6.4 Student book \nquestions\nCheck your learning\u00bb Weblink\nSupreme Court of  \nVictoria \u2013 class actions\u00bb Weblink\nClass actions in the Federal CourtAustralia\u2019s \ufb01rst successful class action occurred in 1995 when a \ufb01rm of  solicitors, Slater & Gordon, \nrepresented more than 1 000 people who had suffered salmonella poisoning as a result of  eating \ncontaminated peanut butter (a type of  product liability class action). Other well- known representative proceedings include business owners suing Esso as a result of  the Esso Longford gas explosion in 1998; claims in relation to the bush\ufb01res that occurred in Victoria in 2009; and a series of  bank fee class actions for repayment of  fees charged by banks to their customers.\nBenefits of/uni00A0representative proceedings\nThere has been a signi\ufb01cant increase in the number of  representative proceedings in recent years in Victoria and in Australia.

At times, a signi\ufb01cant percentage of  any damages awarded or settlement amount will be paid out in legal fees and expenses before the group members receive any/uni00A0funds.\nAnother example of  a Victorian class action is Downie V Spiral Foods Pty Ltd [2015] USC 190.litigation funder \na third party who pays for some or all of the costs and expenses associated with initiating a claim in return f\nor a share \nof the proceeds.

It is possible that you will be asked to demonstrate your unders\ntanding of \nthese sanctions in your assessment/uni00A0tasks.Study tip\nFines\nA \ufb01ne is a sanction that can be imposed by the court. It is an amount of  money ordered to be paid by the \noffender to the state of  Victoria. A/uni00A0\ufb01ne can be imposed as the only sanction, or it can be imposed with \nany other sanction. \nThe amount of  the \ufb01ne will often depend on the maximum penalty that may be imposed for a certain \noffence, which is normally prescribed in the statute setting out that offence. An example is provided in the extract that follows for offences relating to bomb hoaxes. There is similar federal legislation which also makes bomb hoaxes illegal.\ufb01ne \na sanction that requires the offender to pay an amount of money to the/uni00A0stateCrimes Act/uni00A01958 (Vic)\n317A Bomb/uni00A0hoaxes\n(1) A person must/uni00A0not/uni00A0\u2014 \n(a) place an article or substance in any place;/uni00A0or\n(b) send an article or substance by any means of transportation/uni00A0\u2013  A person must not with the \nintention of inducing in another person a false belief that the article or substance is likely to \nexplode or ignite or discharge a dangerous or deleterious matter.  Penalty:/uni00A0Level 6 imprisonment (5/uni00A0years maximum) or a level 6 fine (600 penalty units maximum) or/uni00A0both.EXTRACT\nThe Sentencing Act expresses \ufb01nes in levels (1\u2013 12). Level 2 is the highest level, and level 12 is the lowest \nlevel. Each level refers to a number of  penalty units. Level 2 attracts a \ufb01ne of  3 000 penalty units, whereas \nlevel 12 attracts a \ufb01ne of  1 penalty unit. The court cannot order a \ufb01ne at level 1 (very serious offences such as murder).\nThe use of  \u2018penalty units\u2019 instead of  \ufb01xed monetary \ufb01nes allows the government to increase all \ufb01nes \nby increasing the value of  a penalty unit each year without changing all statutes. Using the example for a bomb hoax offence, setting the \ufb01ne to a maximum of  600 penalty units will mean that the maximum \ufb01ne that can be imposed will increase annually, because the value of  penalty units will increase.\nUnder the Sentencing Act, when \ufb01xing a \ufb01ne a court must consider the \ufb01nancial circumstances of  the \noffender and the nature of  the burden that payment will impose. The court may also consider any loss or destruction of, or damage to, property suffered by a person as a result of  the offence and the value of  any bene\ufb01t to the offender as a result of  the offence.\nIf  a \ufb01ne is not paid, the offender can be imprisoned or ordered to undertake community/uni00A0work.\nThe case below is an example of  the court imposing a \ufb01ne as a general deterrence against employers \nfailing to address safety risks.A fine is not paid to \nthe victim of a crime. Instead, it is paid to the state of Victoria. However, a court can make a restitution order or compensation order which may involve a payment to the victim.Did you know?\nCompany found guilty and/uni00A0fined \nDPP v Bilic Homes Pty Ltd [2016] VCC 810 (14 June/uni00A02016)\nIn March 2014, Bilic Homes, a registered company, was engaged to build two units on a site in \nBrighton East.

Bilic Homes entered \nan early plea of guilty.\nThe Court accepted that general deterrence was an \nimportant sentencing consideration. In sentencing, the judge referred to a previous judgment which noted that sentences in such cases draw attention to the importance of workplace safety, and there was a need to send a message \nto employers that failure to address safety risks will attract \nsignificant punishment.

The former student believes the school was negligent in failing to ensure that she got good grades. She has sent several letters of demand, arguing that the school knew she had certain needs, but failed to address those needs. As a result, the student claims she failed to get into her choice of university and choice of degree, and has suffered loss and damage as a result, including anxiety, depression, and the cost of having to undertake a different degree to eventually transfer to her degree of choice. The former student is also threatening to sue some of the school\u2019s employees, including the counsellor and two of her teachers. The total damages the student is claiming is $1.5/uni00A0million.\nYour Legal Studies teacher thinks this is a good \nopportunity for each of the class members to demonstrate his or her knowledge about the civil justice system. She tells each of you to imagine that you have to write a paper to the principal, who has no understanding of the civil justice system, so that the principal can understand the basic issues that may be involved in the dispute. She says the paper needs to be prepared in plain English and be easily understood by somebody who has little understanding of legal concepts. Ronald Rump and his criminal history\nRonald Rump, 45, had a dif\ufb01cult childhood, \nhaving suffered from bullying as a child and post-traumatic stress disorder after he lost the love of his life in a car accident at the age of 16. He turned to drugs and alcohol to cope with his dif\ufb01culties and was regularly caught for drink driving, petty theft and property damage. He has served \ufb01ve stints in prison over his lifetime, the last of which was four years in Barwon Prison for robbery. During his last stint in prison, Ronald actively participated in a drug and alcohol program which saw him recover from his addiction.\nSince then, Ronald has been living with \nhis partner, Belinda. However, recently Belinda has been acting erratically. She has \nmissed a number of days at work which has resulted in her getting \ufb01red, and is out late at night. Ronald has had good support from \nhis family throughout his life.\nOne day Ronald got home from work early \nand saw Belinda doing drugs. Ronald was outraged, particularly given his attempts to recover from his past addictions. He and Belinda got into a \ufb01ght. Ronald became violent towards Belinda, resulting in \nher being hospitalised. Ronald has since \nbeen charged with various indictable offences, including causing serious injury \nintentionally. Ronald has been refused bail, and has pleaded not guilty. He wants to \nnegotiate with the prosecutor to drop the \ncharges and for him to be found not guilty. \nBelinda doesn\u2019t like the idea of negotiations.\nPractice assessment task questions\n1  Identify who has the burden of proof in \nthis case, and the extent to which the \ncase needs to be proven. \n(2 marks)\n2  Belinda is a witness for the prosecution in \nthis case.

As a result, the student claims she failed \nto get into her choice of university and choice of \ndegree, and has suffered loss and damage as a result, \nincluding anxiety, depression, and the cost of having \nto undertake a different degree to eventually transfer \nto her degree of choice.

spared jail, a court has heard, \nbecause his moral culpability was/uni00A0low.\nSukhuinder Singh, 23, was illegally alone in his Holden \nCommodore when he overtook two cars in Bridge Inn Road in Wollert on July 31 last year, and ploughed into the car driven by John Voss at more than 110km/ h.\nMr Voss, 30, was remembered in the County Court on \nMonday as a caring, loving and responsible son, brother and friend.\nDuring victim impact statements read to the court, Mr \nVoss\u2019 girlfriend and one of his friends called on Singh to face the consequences of his actions.But defence counsel Gideon Boas told the court \nhis client should not be jailed and instead serve a community corrections order, as his moral culpability was \u2018quite low\u2019, as he made a \u2018grave error\u2019 in overtaking, was remorseful and took responsibility for his actions.\nSingh pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing \ndeath and was last week found not guilty by a jury of the more serious charge of culpable driving causing/uni00A0death...\nProsecutor Andrew Grant said the court had to \u2018send \na message\u2019 that dangerous driving by young motorists would not be condoned, and called for Singh to be jailed given his actions put many drivers at/uni00A0risk...\nSingh\u2019s case was a serious example of the offence, \nthe prosecutor said, and not an example of low- level

CLCs will generally consider the following factors:\n\u2022 the type of  legal matter the person needs help/uni00A0with\u2022 if  other assistance is available (e.g. through/uni00A0VLA)\u2022 if  the person has a good chance of  success\u2022 if  the accused is able to manage the case without/uni00A0help\u2022 if  the CLC is available to assist.\nFor accused persons who require legal representation and assistance, it is normally only provided if  \nthey meet VLA \u2019s eligibility criteria for a grant of  legal assistance (i.e. they will be subject to the means test \nand other criteria).\nMany CLCs only help with minor criminal matters. For example, St Kilda Legal Service and the Mental \nHealth Legal Centre can\u2019t assist an accused charged with an indictable offence.\nFunding of CLCs\nCLCs receive their funding from a range of  sources:/uni00A0state, Commonwealth and local governments and private donations. A/uni00A0large portion of  its funding comes from VLA. In the 2015\u2013 16 \ufb01nancial year, VLA provided $28.4 million to/uni00A0CLCs.\nFunding to CLCs is an issue in Australia because of  the signi\ufb01cant demand for legal assistance. \nIn 2016, a Fund Equal Justice campaign was launched. According to the campaign:\n\u2022 CLCs in Australia provide free legal help to over 216 000 people/uni00A0a/uni00A0year\u2022 CLCs are forced to turn away over 160 000 people every year, largely due to a lack of  resources\u2022 it was proposed that in 2017, Commonwealth Government funding to CLCs would be cut by \n30 per/uni00A0cent. The campaign sought a reversal of  funding cuts and an injection of  funds from the Commonwealth \nGovernment so that it could provide legal assistance to disadvantaged people. In April 2017, the \nCommonwealth Government announced it would reverse the proposed 30 per cent cut and would provide an additional $39/uni00A0 million for CLCs over three years. The Victorian Government in their May 2017 budget/uni00A0also pledged $29.5 million for VLA and CLCs. There still, however, remains a signi\ufb01cant gap between the demand for legal aid, and the funding that is provided to meet that demand. \nFrank and Youthlaw\nFrank, 17, was at a house party one night with his friends.

A/uni00A0scuffle broke out between the uninvited \nboys and Frank's friends. Frank got involved by trying to pull apart some of the boys who were fighting.

That is, \u2018legal \naid\u2019 means more than just representation in court, and a person may be given legal aid without being \nformally represented by/uni00A0VLA.\nAs well as providing legal aid, VLA \u2019s other roles are/uni00A0to:\n\u2022 control and administer the Legal Aid Fund (which contains the money available to VLA)\n\u2022 in cooperation with government bodies and departments, meet the needs of  the community for \nlegal/uni00A0aid\n\u2022 make recommendations about law/uni00A0reform\u2022 design and implement educational programs to promote understanding by the public of  their rights, \npowers, privileges and duties under/uni00A0laws\n\u2022 research legal aid issues.\nVLA funding is criticised for not being enough to meet the demands for legal services. Because of  a \nlack of  funding, a large part of  the community is ineligible for legal aid and people are forced to defend \nthemselves in criminal/uni00A0cases.The criminal justice system can be dif\ufb01cult to understand without legal assistance. Often an \naccused hasn\u2019t had experience with the criminal justice system, doesn\u2019t know their rights, and doesn\u2019t understand key concepts such as the burden of/uni00A0proof.\nThe High Court has ruled that if  a person is charged with a serious indictable offence and, through no fault \nof  their own, is unrepresented, they should be given the opportunity to seek legal representation. This is based on the principle that every accused person has the right to receive a fair trial, and that legal representation is necessary for a fair trial of  a serious criminal offence. A/uni00A0court can adjourn a trial if  the accused doesn\u2019t have legal representation, can\u2019t afford a lawyer and won\u2019t get a fair trial if  they aren\u2019t represented.\nIf  an accused can\u2019t afford legal representation, government- funded institutions such as Victoria Legal Aid (VLA) and Victorian community legal centres (CLCs) may be able to help/uni00A0them.\nVictoria Legal/uni00A0Aid\nVLA is a government agency that provides free legal advice to the community, and low- cost or no- cost legal representation for people who can\u2019t afford to pay for a lawyer. VLA helps people with legal problems, and focuses on people who need it the most and can\u2019t get legal assistance any other/uni00A0wa y\n.\nVLA \u2019s vision is a fair and just society where \nrights and responsibilities are upheld. Its purpose is to make a difference by resolving and preventing legal problems, and encouraging a fair and transparent justice system.\nRole/uni00A0of/uni00A0VLA\nThe objectives of  VLA are/uni00A0to:\n\u2022 provide legal aid in the most effective, economic and ef\ufb01cient/uni00A0manner\u2022 manage its resources to make legal aid available at a reasonable cost to the community and on an \nequitable basis throughout Victoria\n\u2022 provide the community with improved access to justice and legal remedies\u2022 pursue innovative means to provide legal aid to minimise the need for individual legal services in the \ncommunity.\nThe most critical role VLA plays is to provide legal aid to accused people. In the 2015\u2013 16 \ufb01nancial \nyear, VLA helped 86 847 different clients. Of  these, 48 511 clients were assisted in criminal/uni00A0cases (being \nthose clients who accessed one or more legal services).\n\u2018Legal aid\u2019 includes legal education and information, legal advice and legal representation. Legal \nadvice is normally limited to advice and information about the law and how it applies to a particular case. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the lawyer giving that advice formally represents the accused. Legal representation means that VLA will \u2018represent\u2019 the accused in the case (that is, VLA will be on record as the accused\u2019s lawyer).Free legal aid has \nexisted in Victoria for \nmore than 100/uni00A0years. \nIn 1978, the Legal Aid \nCommission of Victoria \nwas set up as an \nindependent statutory \nbody (after the Victorian \nParliament passed the \nLegal Aid Act 1978 [Vic]). \nIn 1995, it changed \nits name to Victoria \nLegal/uni00A0Aid.Did you know?Prior to 1928, legal aid \nin Victoria was only \navailable to prisoners \nor the very poor (those \nwho owned property \nworth less than 50 \npounds). More than 50 \nper cent of people were \nturned away because \nthey were ineligible for \nlegal/uni00A0aid.

This is known as active \ncitizenship. You will study this through both Units 3/uni00A0& 4 in understanding and appreciating how individuals can influence changes in the law, how individuals can use the court system  to \nenforce their rights, and how members of society can show the need for reform to  our justice systems.\nThe principles of justice \u2018Justice\u2019 refers to  the fair and equitable treatment of all individuals \nunder the law. It is a common concept and something that Australians often want to  see being upheld \u2013 particularly when it \ncomes to  serious crimes that have been committed. In this course \nyou will look at the three principles of justice:\u2022 fairness\n\u2022 equality\n\u2022 access .\nProblem-solving and application skillsA key  focus in this course is developing your problem-solving and \napplication skills.

You will consider areas of the law such/uni00A0as:\n\u2022 criminal cases and civil disputes\u2022 problems with the law and the legal/uni00A0system\u2022 problems with the way  in which our law-makers operate.\nIn each of these areas, you may be expected to  develop possible \nstrategies to  help resolve problems and issues.\nRecent focus An important part of this course requires you to  be up to  date with \nwhat is happening in Australia\u2019s legal system.  For example, in Unit 3 \nyou are required to  discuss recent reforms to  the criminal and civil \njustice systems. fairness \none of the principles of justice; fairness means having fair processes and a fair hearing (e.g. the parties in a legal case should have an opportunity to  know the \nfacts of the case and have the opportunity to present their side \nof events; and the pre-hearing and hearing [or trial] processes should be fair and impartial)\nequality \none of the principles of justice; equality means people should be equal before the law and have the same opportunity to  present \ntheir case as anyone else, without advantage or disadvantage\naccess \none of the principles of justice; access means that all people should be able to  understand \ntheir legal rights and pursue their caseSource 7 The final assessment task that you will undertake is the end-of-year examination, set by VCAA  and held in November each/uni00A0year.\nSource 8 K ey themes covered in VCE Legal Studies Units/uni00A03/uni00A0&/uni00A04\nCheck your obook assess for  these additional resources and more:\n \u00bb Video tutorial \nHow  to structure an \nessay \u00bb Weblink \nVCAA \u2013 current Study \nDesign \u00bb Weblink\nVCAA \u2013 examination table \u00bb Course planner\nPrintable course planner for VCE  Legal Studies\n01_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   7 9/10/2017   1:35 PM",

If \nyou\u2019re going to perform at your best, you will need to make time for regular periods of study and revision outside school hours. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to study for hours every day, but it does mean you should incorporate short periods of revision into your daily routine. Studying daily will help you to continually reinforce new concepts in your mind and help you avoid the stress of last-minute cramming. Here are some tips to help you study e\ufb00ectively:\nChoose the/uni00A0best place to/uni00A0study\n\u2022 Ev eryone has their own idea about the best study environment. Whether it\u2019s in \nyour bedroom, at your local library, or at your favourite caf\u00e9, you need to \ufb01nd a regular study space that works for you. Ideally, your study space should be quiet, comfortable, bright and airy, and free from distractions.\n\u2022 Mak e sure your study space is stocked with the things that you need (such \nas stationery) and decorated with things that make you feel calm (such as artworks or plants).\n01_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   8 9/10/2017   1:35 PM",

Decide what works best for you and plan for regular study sessions at this time of day. Don\u2019t work too late into the evenings though, as this can make you tired for school the next/uni00A0day.\nRemember that studying can take many di\ufb00erent/uni00A0forms\n\u2022 Finding time for study can sometimes be di\ufb03cult, so keep in mind that e\ufb00ective studying can take di\ufb00erent forms and happen almost anywhere:\n\u2022 you might read over your notes for 10 minutes on the bus on your way \nto/uni00A0school\n\u2022 you might have a chat to your friends at lunch about a concept that you found di\ufb03cult in class or \norganise regular group study sessions with your friends.\n\u2022 you might make an audio recording of your notes and listen to them while you\u2019re exercising.\nTip 3 \u2013 Manage your study time effectively\nNow that you have your study space set up and have chosen a regular time to study, it helps to put some \npractical strategies in place to stay on track.

If your \ntimetable isn\u2019t working, revisit it and make a new one.\nUse a diary, wall planner or calendar to record key dates\u2022 Recording key dates is essential to your success.

To  be able to  recognise laws  and legal cases, and to  reference them in your notes \nand assessment tasks, you  should master the basics of legal citation.\nWhat is legal citation?\nLegal citation is the system used to  refer to  legal documents and \nsources such as cases and Acts of Parliament in a consistent and \naccurate way.  The most commonly cited legal documents/uni00A0are:\n\u2022 Acts of Parliament (also known as statutes and legislation)\n\u2022 judgements from legal cases (also known as court decisions).\nThe following information will help you  in reading and \nunderstanding legal citations. It will also help you  cite legal \ndocuments correctly in your coursework and assessment/uni00A0tasks.\nCiting Acts of/uni00A0Parliament\nActs of Parliament (often called just \u2018Acts\u2019) are  laws  made by  the \nvarious parliaments in Australia (i.e. state  and territory parliaments \nand the Commonwealth Parliament) and in other countries around the/uni00A0world.\nActs of Parliament generally feature the following pieces of \ninformation in this/uni00A0order:\n\u2022 The name of the Act  or statute \u2013 This is the title that has been \ngiven to  the statute. It is always  written in italics.\n\u2022 The year that it was  made by  parliament \u2013 This is also written \nin italics.\n\u2022 The parliament that passed it \u2013 This will be either a state  or territory parliament, or the \nCommonwealth Parliament. The  name of the parliament is never written in full; instead, abbreviations \nfor each parliament are  used (e.g. Vic  or/uni00A0Cth).\nExample/uni00A01 \u2013 an/uni00A0Act made by/uni00A0the Victorian Parliament\nThis Act  (i.e. the Crimes Act ) was  made in 1958 by  the Victorian Parliament.\nExample/uni00A02 \u2013 an/uni00A0Act made by/uni00A0the Commonwealth Parliament\nThis Act  (i.e. the Competition and Consumer Act ) was  made in 2010 by  the Commonwealth Parliament.Crimes  Act 1958  (Vic)\nTitle Year Parliament\nCompetition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth)\nTitle Year ParliamentSource 1  Legal citation is a \nsystem  designed to  help people \ncite (i.e. refer to) specific laws and legal cases in a consistent and accurate/uni00A0way.\nlegal citation the system  used to  refer \nto legal documents and \nsources such as cases and statutes\nAct of Parliament \na law made by \nparliament; a bill which has passed through parliament and has received royal  assent \n(also known as a statute)\n01_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   17 9/10/2017   1:35 PM",

If you know the year, you can look it up under \u2018Victorian numbered acts\u2019. However,  for your \npurposes, you will generally be citing the principal act anyway./uni00A0 Study/uni00A0tip\nA short video with tips and examples of how to cite legal cases and \nActs of Parliament is provided on your obook assess. Watch it to  help \ndevelop  your skills!Study/uni00A0tipCiting amending/uni00A0acts\nAmending acts are  a type of statute that amend (i.e. change or update) a statute that already exists. \nAmending acts are  repealed (i.e. cancelled) once the amendments are  made to  the existing statute.\nFor example, the Sentencing (Community Correction Order) and Other Acts  Amendment Act  2016 (Vic) is \nan amending Act  which amends the Sentencing Act  1991 (Vic), the Bail Act  1977 (Vic) and various other \nVictorian Acts. The  sole purpose of the Sentencing (Community Correction Order) and Other Acts  Amendment \nAct is to amend (i.e. change or update) those Acts. For  example, it might result in certain sections of the \nexisting Acts being deleted, added and amend certain words or phrases being changed. \nAn amending act is cited in the same way  as other acts. Sometimes the title will let you  know that is \nan amending act, as in the above  examples, but not always.  \nExample 3 \u2013 an/uni00A0amending act passed by/uni00A0the Victorian Parliament\nThis amending act (i.e. the Sentencing (Community Correction Order) and Other Acts  Amendment Act ) was  \nmade in 2016 by  the Victorian Parliament.\nOnce the amending act has done its work, it is repealed, and it will no longer appear in the list of  \ncurrent Acts. That  will occur once the changes it makes to  the principal act (the act it is amending) \ncommence. In this example, the Sentencing (Community Correction Order) and Other Acts  Amendment Act  \nstates that it will be repealed on 2 October 2018. That  is because the changes it makes to  various principal \nacts take  e\ufb00ect on 1 October 2018./uni00A0/uni00A0 \nCiting bills\nBills are  drafts of proposed laws  that have  been presented to  parliament but haven\u2019t been passed into law.  \nWhen citing bills, you  should adopt the same approach as acts, except the word  \u2018Act\u2019 is replaced by  the \nword  \u2018Bill\u2019 , and the title of the bill is not italicised.\nExample 4 \u2013 a bill being presented to/uni00A0the Victorian Parliament\nThis Bill (i.e. the Disability Amendment Bill) was  presented in 2004 by  the Victorian Parliament.\nCiting legal/uni00A0cases\nLike acts, decisions from legal cases that are  heard in a tribunal or court also have  citations. Whenever \na written decision or judgment has been handed down by  a tribunal or court, it is given a citation so  that \npeople can refer back/uni00A0to/uni00A0it.\nLegal case citations generally feature the following pieces of information in this/uni00A0order:\n\u2022 The names of the parties \u2013 The name of the person who starts the case (usually called the plainti\ufb00, \nprosecutor or applicant) goes \ufb01rst.

Admission is a ceremony \nin the Supreme Court which takes place after extra time spent in practical training. The lawyer then \nneeds to be registered as a lawyer and obtain a practising certi\ufb01  cate from the Legal Services Board (the regulator in Victoria). Both solicitors and barristers provide certain types of legal services, and often the types of legal services they provide overlap. To get a better idea of what lawyers do, we will now look brie\ufb02  y at/uni00A0both.  \n    \n  Solicitors  \n  Lawyers who see clients direct (also known as solicitors, to distinguish them from barristers) provide a range of legal services depending on the areas of law in which they are willing to accept work.

For example, some lawyers specialise in employment law, while others \nspecialise in mergers and acquisitions. \nThere are many di\ufb00erent areas of law that a lawyer may specialise in, including\n\u2022 wills and inheritance\n\u2022 family/uni00A0law\u2022 employment/uni00A0law\u2022 personal/uni00A0injury\u2022 mergers and acquisitions\u2022 commercial disputes\u2022 large infrastructure projects\u2022 property\u2022 entertainment\u2022 building and construction.\u2022 class actions\u2022 charities and not for/uni00A0pro\ufb01t\nBarristers\nA barrister is a lawyer who specialises in giving advice in di\ufb03cult cases and representing clients in court. \nAs lawyers, they must be admitted and have a practising certi\ufb01cate. In Victoria, a lawyer who wishes to practice exclusively as a barrister must become a member of the Victorian Bar. The Victorian Bar is the professional association that represents more than 2000 barristers in Victoria. Becoming a member requires the barrister to undertake an exam and a course which allows them to develop the skills required to be a barrister.\nBarristers generally specialise in a particular court and in a particular area of law. As a result, they \ndevelop a special set of skills. The barrister will be briefed (engaged in writing) by the solicitor or law \ufb01rm, and generally not directly by the client who needs legal advice (though this can occur with experienced corporate clients). Communications will be between the barrister and the solicitor, not between the barrister and the client.\nUnlike solicitors, all barristers practice as individuals, rather than as partners or employees of a law \n\ufb01rm or company. \nIn Victoria, there are senior barristers (called Queen\u2019s Counsel or Senior Counsel) and junior barristers \n(called Counsel). TYPE OF LAWYER DESCRIPTION\nGovernment lawyers Government lawyers are employed by the government (e.g. government departments). They \nprovide legal services exclusively to the governments they work/uni00A0for.\nFor example, the Victorian Government Solicitor\u2019s Office (VGS) provides legal services to the Victorian Government.\nIn-house lawyers In-house lawyers are employed by private companies and organisations. They provide legal \nservices to the companies and organisations they work/uni00A0for.For example, Qantas may have its own lawyers who provide the Qantas business with legal services.\nPrivate practice lawyersPrivate practice lawyers are employed by private law firms. Private law firms can/uni00A0be:\u2022 small \u2018boutique\u2019 firms (that specialise in a particular area of law such as intellectual \nproperty)\n\u2022 medium-sized/uni00A0firms\u2022 large top-tier firms (that have a number of different teams specialising across different \nareas of the/uni00A0law).\nPrivate practice lawyers provide legal services to their clients in accordance with their/uni00A0needs.For example, a person who believes they have been unfairly treated by their employer may engage a private practice lawyer to help resolve their legal dispute.\nSource 3 Ways employed lawyers can practice in Australia.There are di\ufb00erent ways in which a person can practice as an employed lawyer in Australia.

  "Page 42": "30  UNIT 3  RIGHTS AND JUSTICETHE NATURE OF LAWS AND THEIR \nPURPOSES 2.1 \nLaws  are legal rules made by a legal authority (such as parliament or the courts). Laws control the \nbehaviour of people and aim to achieve social cohesion. Laws help everyone to live together in a \ncohesive and harmonious way by establishing boundaries of acceptable behaviour.\nLaws aim to protect the rights of individuals, including:\n\u2022 the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty\n\u2022 the right not to be imprisoned without a court hearing\u2022 the right to live free from discrimination or harassment \u2022 the right to expect promises made in a contract to be kept.\nPeople should be able to take legal action to have their rights enforced, and seek compensation for any \nloss they have su\ufb00ered.\nNon-legal rules are made and enforced by private individuals or groups (such as parents, sporting \nclubs and schools). They are not made by legal authorities. For example, your local cricket club may have \na rule that players must attend training each week with the correct uniform and equipment. If you break this rule, the club may decide to impose a penalty such as preventing you from playing in an important match, but you cannot be taken to court for breaking the rule.\nWhen millions of people live together in a society, it is inevitable that laws will be broken and disputes \nwill arise. The legal system decides criminal cases and civil disputes so that people are dealt with by a \ufb01nal authority in a fair way. Laws have consequences for people who break them, and this can also discourage other people from acting the same way. For example, if you text a friend while driving a car and you accidentally injure a pedestrian who is crossing the road, you may be charged with breaking the law, and receive a penalty (known as a sanction). Sanctions are imposed by the courts and may include paying a \ufb01ne (for minor breaches) or a prison sentence (for more serious breaches).Designer Note: Begin Topic 2.1 \n- START NEW PAGEDesigner Note: Size: 2 pages\nDesigner Note: Insert Artwork: \n0203_10363_COMDesigner Note: Insert Artwork: 0203a_10363-rfDesigner Note: Insert Artwork: 0203b_10363-r\nSource 1 When millions of people live together in a society, it is inevitable that laws will be broken and \ndisputes will arise.

They agreed to be a federation of states within the new Commonwealth of Australia.\nThe formal title of the Australian Constitution is the \nCommonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (UK). It came into operation on 1 January 1901, the date of Federation. The Constitution is the most important document in Australia\u2019s history, as it created what we now know as the Commonwealth of Australia, and established the framework for our parliament and its law-making powers.\nThe High Court of Australia was also established by \nthe Australian Constitution.

The main types of law in \nAustralia are statute law made by parliament and common law (developed gradually by courts, also \ncalled case law or judge-made law). \nParliament\nParliament is the law-making institution of government. Parliaments debate and pass laws for the peace, order and good government of the community.\nThere are nine parliaments in Australia: one Commonwealth Parliament, six state parliaments, and \ntwo territory parliaments. Each parliament is the supreme law-making body within its area of power (jurisdiction), meaning that each parliament can make, change or abolish laws whenever it wants to, as long as it does not go beyond its law-making powers.\nAustralia\u2019s parliamentary system is based on Britain\u2019s Westminster system. Under the Westminster \nsystem, the parliament is bicameral, meaning it consists of two separate houses, referred to as the upper house and the lower house. These houses are made up of members who have been democratically elected by the people and should represent their views and values. In Australia today, all parliaments are bicameral except for those in Queensland, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory.\nParliament also includes the Queen\u2019s representative: the Governor-General at the Commonwealth \nlevel and the governor at state level, who act on behalf of the Queen.\nThe political party that has the majority of members in the lower house forms government. The \nmain political party other than the government forms the opposition. Other political party members and independent members are called crossbenchers.\nStatute law\nA statute (also known as an Act of Parliament or legislation) is a law passed by a state parliament or the Commonwealth Parliament. Parliament\u2019s main role is to pass legislation to regulate the community. This involves drawing up a bill (a proposed law) and having it debated \nand passed by a majority of members in both houses of parliament. After both houses of parliament have passed a bill, it must also receive royal assent or approval by the Queen\u2019s \nrepresentative before \ufb01nally becoming an Act of Parliament.\nStatutes will have the word \u2018Act\u2019 in their title \nand will also show when the act was made and which parliament made it. For example, the Marriage Act 1961 (Cth) is a statute passed by the Commonwealth Parliament in 1961.statute law \nlaw made by parliament; also known as legislation or Acts of Parliament (as opposed to common law)\ncommon law \nlaw made by judges through decisions made in cases; also known as case law or judge-made law (as opposed to statute law)\ngovernment \nthe ruling authority with power to govern, formed by the political party that holds the majority in the lower house in each parliament.

Examples \ninclude parking laws  made by  local councils and court rules \nmade by  the court. \nCourts\nCourts play an important role in the legal system. Courts are  \nformal legal institutions that interpret and apply the laws  made \nby parliament. In Australia, the courts operate independently \nof parliament and the government. Courts are  presided over  by \njudges (and magistrates). When courts interpret and apply laws  \nmade by  parliament, they can broaden or narrow the meaning \nof a word  or phrase in a statute. Once the meaning is decided, \nit can become a principle of  law (precedent) that is to  be followed in the future.\nJudges can also develop law  when deciding on a new issue where no existing legislation applies, or \nwhere a previous principle of  law requires expansion to  apply to  a new situation. Judges are  therefore also \nlaw-makers; their law  is called case law  or common law.\nIn Australia, some courts are  Commonwealth (federal) courts and some are  state  courts. Generally, \neach court deals with issues that arise under its jurisdiction. The  Commonwealth courts are  the High \nCourt of Australia, the Federal Court, the Federal Circuit Court and the Family Court. The  Victorian \ncourts are  the Supreme Court (divided into the Trial Division and the Court of Appeal), the County Court, \nthe Magistrates\u2019 Court, the Children\u2019s Court and the Coroners Court.\nThe courts in Australia are  ranked in a hierarchy, with the higher courts hearing the more serious and \ncomplicated cases, and the lower courts dealing with everyday issues. While the High Court is a federal \ncourt, it is also the court of appeal from each state\u2019s highest court. The  High Court only hears appeals \nthat raise important points of  law.

  "Page 48": "36  UNIT  3 RIGHT S AND JUSTICE2.4 CRIMINAL LAW AND CIVIL LAW\nIn Australia, there are  two main areas of  law \u2013 criminal law  and civil law .\nCriminal law\nCriminal law  is an area of  law that protects the community by  establishing and de\ufb01ning what crimes are.  \nIt also sets down sanctions (i.e penalties) for  people who commit them.\nA crime is an act or an omission that: \n\u2022 br eaks  an existing  law\n\u2022 is harmful  to an individual  or society  as a whole\n\u2022 is punishable  by law.\nA criminal case comes into existence when the police (or other investigative agency) investigate a \ncrime that has been committed, and charge a person with that crime.\nCriminal law  is designed to  protect members of society and impose sanctions on those who commit \no\ufb00ences. In Victoria, many statutes aim to  do this. One is the Crimes Act  1958 (Vic). The  result of a \nsuccessful criminal prosecution is a \ufb01nding of guilt and the imposition of an appropriate sanction. Courts \nhave  a wide range of sentencing options or sanctions, including \ufb01nes, community correction orders and \nimprisonment. Sentencing has a number of purposes. One of those purposes is to  punish the o\ufb00ender. \nAnother is to  reform the o\ufb00ender by  treating the underlying causes of the o\ufb00ending.\nCivil law\nCivil law  is a body of  law  that sets out the rights and responsibilities of individuals, groups and \norganisations. It also regulates private disputes when these rights have  been infringed.\nCivil disputes arise when someone believes their rights have  been infringed. Civil law  regulates those \ndisputes and seeks to  enforce rights where some harm has been done to  an individual or an organisation. \nThe purpose of a civil action is to  ask the court or tribunal for  a remedy to  return that person (known as \nthe plainti\ufb00) to  the position they were  in before their rights were  infringed.\nThe most common remedy is payment of an amount of money to  the plainti\ufb00 as compensation for  \ntheir su\ufb00ering or loss (referred to  as damages).\nTYPES OF LAW\nThe law relating to  behaviour that \nharms individuals or society as a \nwhole, which the state  will enforce \nby prosecuting offenders in court.The general law that applies to  all \ncitizens, and can be enforced by \ntaking civil action to  seek a remedy.CRIMINAL LAW CIVIL LAW\nSource 1 Criminal law and civil law are the two main areas of law in Australia.criminal law  \nan area of law that \ndefines a range of behaviours and conduct that are prohibited (i.e. crimes) and outlines sanctions (i.e. penalties) for people who commit \nthem (as opposed to  \ncivil law)\ncivil law  \nan area of law that \ndefines the rights and responsibilities of individuals, groups and organisations in society and regulates private disputes (as opposed to  \ncriminal law)\nOverlap between criminal law and civil law\nThere is some overlap between criminal and civil law.

The  outcome of one does not a\ufb00ect the outcome of the other, but a \nguilty verdict in the criminal case may  give  the plainti\ufb00 a stronger case in the civil action. It is possible for  \nan accused to  be found not guilty in a criminal case,  but found liable in a civil case relating to  the same \nbehaviour. The  jury at  a trial (or the magistrate if the case was  heard in the Magistrates\u2019 Court) may have  \nfound the accused \u2018not guilty\u2019 because there was  a reasonable doubt.

It means that \neveryone \u2013 individuals, groups and the government \u2013 is bound by the law and must obey the law. The rule of law also means that laws should be such that people are willing and able to abide by them. That is, no matter what a person\u2019s authority or position, they must comply with laws. This includes members of parliament, leaders of government, judges and public o\ufb03cials. Even the people who make the law are bound by it.\nThe fact that parliaments and governments must obey the Australian Constitution is an example of the \nrule of law at work in Australia. The Constitution imposes restrictions on the law-making powers of the parliaments so that their powers are restrained.\nA number of legal principles combine to uphold the rule of law; for example:\n\u2022 laws must be clear, understood, known and accessible\n\u2022 c ourts and judges must be independent so that trials and hearings can be free from pressure or \nin\ufb02uence from the other branches of government\n\u2022 the law must be applied equally and fairly, without favour or discrimination, and no person is above \nthe law\n\u2022 all people charged with a crime are presumed to be innocent until proven guilty in court \u2022 p eople are free to criticise and challenge parliament and government, can seek to in\ufb02uence changes \nin the law, and can demonstrate without fear\n\u2022 trials and hearings should be conducted openly and in a transparent way to ensure that parties are \ngiven the opportunity to present their case, and rebut the other party\u2019s case.In Units 3 & 4 you will explore various principles that support the rule of law.

It involves the police, courts, pre-trial procedures and sentencing. Two of the \nkey purposes of the criminal justice system are to:\n\u2022 decide whether an accused is guilty of an o\ufb00ence\u2022 impose a sanction  in cases where an accused has been found guilty (or pleaded guilty).\nWhen an individual is convicted and sentenced for committing a crime, a fair process must be followed \nto ensure justice is achieved.\nAs shown in Source 1, some of the key stages in a criminal case include:\n\u2022 investigation of a crime (police investigations)\u2022 charging the accused\u2022 pre-trial procedures (e.g. the parties having to attend hearings before a magistrate or judge)\u2022 d etermining guilt in a court hearing (i.e. the jury or magistrate has considered all the evidence and \ndecided the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt)\n\u2022 sentencing (i.e. deciding the appropriate penalty)\u2022 managing post-sentencing processes (e.g. the imprisonment of an o\ufb00ender).\nAustralia\u2019s justice system\nThere is no single, uni\ufb01ed criminal justice system in Australia. This is due to the fact that under the \nAustralian Constitution, the Commonwealth Parliament does not have power to make laws about crime in general. Instead, the states have power to maintain public order and protect citizens. As a result, each state and territory in Australia has its own laws that establish:\n\u2022 what is considered a crime\u2022 the ways of determining criminal cases\u2022 the maximum penalty that could be imposed for each speci\ufb01c crime.\nEach state and territory also has its own police force, courts and prison system. \nCriminal cases in Victoria\nIn Victoria, the courts that hear and determine criminal cases are:\u2022 the Magistrates\u2019 Court\u2022 the County Court\n\u2022 the Supreme Court.\nThe Children\u2019s Court also hears criminal cases in Victoria, where a child (between the ages of 10 \nand 17) has been accused of committing a crime. \nAlthough the administration of criminal justice is a power held by the state, the Commonwealth \nParliament has the power to pass criminal laws if it relates to its constitutional powers in some way (e.g. Investigation\nof a crimeCharges\nagainst an\naccusedPre-trial\nproceduresDetermining\nguiltSentencingPost-\nsentencing\nprocesses\nSource 1 An overview of some of the key stages in a criminal case.

  "Page 58": "46  UNIT 3  RIGHTS AND JUSTICE3.2 THE PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE\nJustice is a word you often hear when people \ntalk about the law \u2013 particularly when it comes to verdicts in criminal cases.\nEvery day, newspaper articles, news \nreports, websites, and radio commentators talk about the outcome of certain criminal cases being \u2018just\u2019 , while others are seen as \u2018unjust\u2019 . There is even a common saying that \u2018justice delayed is justice denied\u2019 .\nSo, while most people would agree that the \ncriminal justice system should achieve justice, what does \u2018justice\u2019 actually mean?\nDefining justice\nJustice is di\ufb03cult to de\ufb01ne as it means di\ufb00erent things to di\ufb00erent people. As a result, there is no single, universally accepted de\ufb01nition of the word. One dictionary de\ufb01nition is \u2018the quality of being fair and reasonable\u2019 , but views on what is considered fair or reasonable in a particular case can vary widely between individuals depending on their cultures, political and religious beliefs, community views, personal experiences and personal values. For example, a victim in a criminal case may view a maximum sentence of ten years as being just, while the family and friends of the accused may see the same sentence as unjust.\nWhen considering whether justice has been achieved in a particular case, it is helpful to consider the \nfollowing three principles of justice:\n\u2022 fairness\n\u2022 equality\n\u2022 access .\nThe three principles can be used as a way to determine whether the criminal justice system as a whole \nis achieving its purpose. \nIn this Area of Study, you will be required to consider whether the criminal justice system upholds \nthe principles of justice, so you should continually revisit these principles when examining aspects of the \nsystem.\nSource 1 \u2018Lady Justice\u2019 (also known as Justicia) above \nthe entrance to the County Court of Victoria.

Make sure you not only understand each of these principles, but also how features of the criminal justice system achieve, or do not achieve, each of them.

A dictionary de\ufb01  nition is \u2018impartial and just treatment or behaviour \nwithout favouritism or discrimination\u2019 . However, like justice, fairness can mean di\ufb00  erent things depending on a person\u2019s values and perspectives.  \n  Fairness does not necessarily mean that everyone gets the same thing. It is often the case in society \nthat to treat someone fairly, you have to treat them di\ufb00  erently (as shown in Source 2).  \n  \nIn the criminal justice system, fairness means fair processes and a fair hearing. People should be able to:   \n\u2022 have their case heard in an impartial and objective manner and without fear or favour\n\u2022      understand court processes   \n\u2022       have the opportunity to present their defence   \n\u2022      have the opportunity to rebut (disprove) \nthe prosecution case.    \n  For example, accused persons should know \nwhat documents and evidence will be used \nagainst them, so they have an opportunity to consider the strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. They should also have an opportunity to challenge the evidence, and have their case heard and determined by people who are unbiased, and are perceived to be unbiased.  \n  If laws are properly and fairly applied, and \nthere is procedural fairness in each criminal case, then the  rule of law  will be upheld. \nFairness does not necessarily mean the same outcome or the same sentence in a criminal case for every single crime of the same nature \u2013 rather, as stated above, fairness may require people to be treated di\ufb00  erently to ensure a fair outcome.  \n  The principle of fairness applies not just to the \ufb01  nal hearing or trial, but to the whole of a criminal \ncase.  \n  In Chapters 4 and 5, you will consider whether the criminal justice system achieves fairness. Some of \nthe aspects of the criminal justice system that relate to fairness include:   \n\u2022      the time it takes for a criminal case to be heard and completed, and whether any delays have \noccurred   \n\u2022      the availability of legal representation for an accused    and for victims\n\u2022      the opportunity for the accused to present their case and know the evidence that will be brought \nagainst them   , and the opportunity to appeal  (review) a decision made\n\u2022      whether the accused and victims can understand legal processes and terminology, and have adequate assistance where necessary   \n\u2022      whether laws and court rules have been properly applied   \n\u2022 whether people have been treated impartially and without fear or favour (including victims).

  "Page 61": "49  CHAPTER 3  INTRODUCTION TO THE VICTORIAN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM  In the criminal justice system, \nequality means that all people should be \ntreated equally before the law, with an equal opportunity to present their case. This means that no person or group should be treated advantageously, or disadvantageously, because of a personal attribute or characteristic. The processes should be free from bias or prejudice, and the persons who make the decision should be impartial. Equal application of the law, and equality in processes, uphold the rule of law.  \n  The  Charter of Human Rights and \nResponsibilities Act 2006  (Vic) is a Victorian statute aimed at protecting and promoting human rights.It states that every Victorian is equal before the law and is entitled to the law\u2019s protection without discrimination.  \n  While the principles of equality and fairness share some similarities, they are quite di\ufb00  erent concepts, \nas seen in Source 5.   \n \n   In Chapters 4 and 5, you will learn more about the ways in which the criminal justice system tries to \nachieve equality.

  "Page 62": "50  UNIT 3  RIGHTS AND JUSTICEAccess\nAccess is the third principle of justice. In simple terms, access is the ability to approach or make use of \nsomething. It is generally accepted that members of society should be able to access education, health, food and shelter. People should also be able to access justice.\nAccess to the criminal justice system means that all people should be able to understand their legal \nrights and pursue their case. This includes more than being able to access the institutions that hear criminal cases (i.e. the courts). It also means being able to approach bodies and institutions that provide legal advice, education, information and assistance, and receive from them information about criminal cases, processes and outcomes.\nAccess to the criminal justice system does not necessarily mean that the person seeking access will \nget the outcome they want, but it does mean parties should have the opportunity to make use of the processes and institutions within the criminal justice system, and that these are not beyond their reach. For example, individuals who cannot a\ufb00ord the cost of engaging legal representation and advice should have access to free legal aid or assistance. The following scenario about Sally provides an example of the way the criminal justice system can sometimes be inaccessible to some Victorians.\nSally\u2019s inability to access the legal system\nSally has a hearing disability, intellectual impairment and a mental illness, and lives in public housing in rural Victoria. She has recently fled her previous housing because of a physically abusive relationship with her ex-partner.

They are considered to be less serious types of crime, and include o\ufb00ences such as drink driving, disorderly conduct and minor assaults. There is no right to a jury trial for summary o\ufb00ences.\nSome summary o\ufb00ences are contained in the Summary O\ufb00ences Act 1966 (Vic), but many are listed in \nvarious other Victorian statutes and regulations.\nMost crimes that are committed in Victoria are summary o\ufb00ences. The number of criminal cases \n\ufb01nalised in each of the main Victorian courts for the \ufb01nancial year 2014\u201315 is set out in Source 1 below.

  "Page 66": "54  UNIT 3  RIGHTS AND JUSTICEThe burden of proof\nThe burden of proof refers to the responsibility of a party to prove the facts of the case. The burden of \nproof lies with the person or party who is bringing the case. In a criminal case, this is the prosecution (i.e. \nthe prosecution has to prove that the accused is guilty).\nOne of the justi\ufb01cations for this is that if the prosecution is accusing a person of having committed a \ncrime, then the responsibility should be on the prosecution to establish the facts.\nIn a few cases the burden of proof can be reversed  (e.g. if the accused is pleading a defence such as \nself-defence). \nDrug cases are another example. Section 5 of the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Act 1981 \n(Vic) states that a person is presumed to possess a substance if:\n\u2022 the substance is on their property (owned, rented, used or occupied) and\u2022 the person cannot satisfy the court to the contrary.\nIn this case the onus (responsibility) will be on the accused to prove the drug was not in their possession.\nThe standard of proof\nThe standard of proof refers to the strength of evidence needed to prove the case. In a criminal case, \nthe prosecution must prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. Proving someone guilty beyond \nreasonable doubt does not mean that no doubt at all exists as to the accused\u2019s guilt. It only means that no reasonable doubt is possible from the evidence presented. The judge or members of the jury may still be able to think of fanciful, imaginary or unreasonable doubts (i.e. doubts that aren\u2019t realistic or based on the evidence), but these do not count. To prove guilt in a criminal case all that matters is that no other logical or reasonable conclusion can be reached (based on the facts) except that the accused is guilty.\nIn a criminal case involving indictable o\ufb00ences, the case is heard in the County or Supreme Court \nand a jury will decide on guilt (Chapter 4 has more information about juries). In a criminal case involving summary o\ufb00ences, the case is heard in the Magistrates\u2019 Court and a magistrate (not a jury) will decide on guilt. If the burden of proof is on the accused (for example, the accused is relying on a certain defence), then the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities, but this is an exception.\nThe presumption of innocence\nEvery person accused of a crime is presumed to be innocent until they have gone before a court and have been found guilty. The presumption of innocence is one of the key principles of the rule of law, and is one of the most important concepts on which the criminal justice system is based. It is a guarantee by the state to its citizens that if they are accused of a crime they will be treated, as far as possible, as innocent (not guilty) until the charge has been proved beyond reasonable doubt. \nThe presumption of innocence is a very old common law right. It is now also guaranteed by the \nCharter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act.\nOne of the critical ways in which the presumption of innocence is maintained is by imposing a high \nstandard on the prosecution to prove its case (beyond reasonable doubt), and also imposing the burden of proof on the prosecution. That is, the prosecution has to prove that the accused is guilty. Accused persons do not have to prove they are innocent.\nThe presumption of innocence is also upheld through the system of bail. The rule of law requires \nthere to be a balance between the presumption of innocence and the protection of society. Unless there are good reasons why a person should be deprived of their liberty (i.e. be held in custody), they are entitled to receive bail while they wait for their hearing in court.burden of proof \nthe obligation (i.e. responsibility) of a party to prove a case.

  "Page 71": "59  CHAPTER 3  INTRODUCTION TO THE VICTORIAN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMOne of the cases that has considered the right to be tried without \nunreasonable delay was Gray v DPP [2008] VSC 4 (16 January 2008), in \nwhich Kelly Gray was charged with a number of indictable o\ufb00ences arising out of an incident which occurred in November 2007. Gray applied for bail, and pointed to the delay that he was likely to experience before the trial was to occur as a reason to be granted bail. Justice Bongiorno of the Supreme Court of Victoria noted that the Human Rights Charter guarantees a timely trial, and the inability of the Crown to provide that trial had an e\ufb00ect on the question of bail. He found that the only remedy that the Supreme Court could provide an accused in this situation, where the Crown had failed to guarantee a timely trial, was to release him on bail.\nThe right to a fair hearing\nThe Human Rights Charter entitles a person charged with a criminal o\ufb00ence to have the charge decided by a competent, independent and impartial court after a fair and public hearing.\nThere are two parts to this right:\n1 A competent, independent and impartial court must decide the proceeding or charge. That means, for example, that every person has the right to have their case heard by a quali\ufb01ed and experienced judge or magistrate in an unbiased and objective manner.\n2 A hearing must be fair, and public. Most court hearings are open to the public. This ensures that the trial and trial processes are transparent and not hidden in secrecy. If criminal cases were conducted in secret and con\ufb01dentially, there would be no way for the public to know whether laws are applied properly and processes are fair. An open courtroom allows for public and media scrutiny of processes.\nSource 3 The Human Rights Law Centre is an \nindependent, not-for-profit, non-government \norganisation that aims to protect and promote human rights in Australia.\nSource 4 The right to a fair hearing means that individuals have the right to have their case heard by a \nqualified and experienced judge, and that the hearing be fair and public.\nIn some circumstances a court may exclude members of media organisations or the general public \nfrom all or part of a hearing. For example, the Magistrates\u2019 Court has the power to make an order that \nproceedings are closed to the public if they will cause undue distress or embarrassment to a victim in a sexual o\ufb00ence case.\n03_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   59 10/10/2017   2:29 PM",

  "Page 73": "61  CHAPTER 3  INTRODUCTION TO THE VICTORIAN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMThe right to trial by jury\nThe jury system provides for a trial by others in the community. This right dates back to well before the \nMagna Carta in England, established in 1215, which said that no free man shall be imprisoned except by lawful judgment of his peers. The jury system provides the opportunity for community participation in the legal process, and for the law to be applied according to community standards.\nSource 6 Section 80 of the Australian Constitution states that any person who is charged with a \nCommonwealth indictable offence is entitled to a trial by jury. \nThe right to trial by jury is not protected by the Human Rights Charter, but rather protected in part by \nthe Australian Constitution, and in part by statute law in Victoria.\nSection 80 of the Australian Constitution states that any person who is charged with a Commonwealth \nindictable o\ufb00ence is entitled to a trial by jury. However, section 80 of the Australian Constitution provides only a limited right to trial by jury, because most indictable o\ufb00ences are crimes under state law, and this section only applies to Commonwealth o\ufb00ences. In addition, the Commonwealth Parliament can determine by statute which o\ufb00ences are \u2018indictable\u2019 .\nCommonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900  (UK)\n80 Trial by jury\nThe trial on indictment of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth shall be by jury, and \nevery such trial shall be held in the State where the offence was committed, and if the offence was not committed within any State the trial shall be held at such place or places as the Parliament prescribes.EXTRACTThe Magna Carta is a document agreed to by the King of England in June 1215. It contains several rights still considered important today. It also upholds the fundamental principle that no one is above the law. No one knows how many copies were distributed, but four copies still survive, all of which are in the United Kingdom.Did you know?\n03_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   61 10/10/2017   2:30 PM",

Some of  the objectives of  the Victims\u2019 Charter are  to recognise \nthe impact of crime on victims, to  recognise that victims should be o\ufb00  ered certain information during the \ninvestigation and prosecution process, and to  help reduce the likelihood of secondary victimisation that \nmay be experienced by  the victim as a result of their interaction with the criminal justice system.  \n  The Victims\u2019 Charter de\ufb01  nes \u2018victim\u2019 broadly. Depending on the crime, a victim can include:   \n\u2022      a person who  has su\ufb00 ered  injury  as a direct  result  of a criminal  o\ufb00 ence  (often  called  the \u2018primary  \nvictim\u2019)    \n\u2022      a family  member  of a person who  has died  as a direct  result  of a criminal  o\ufb00 ence     \n\u2022      a family  member  of a person who  is under  18 years  of age or is  incapable  of managing  his or her  \nown a\ufb00  airs because of mental  impairment, and  that person  has su\ufb00 ered  injury  as a direct  result  of \na criminal  o\ufb00 ence    \n\u2022      a child  under  the age of 16  years  who  has been  groomed  for sexual  conduct,  as well  as that child\u2019s  \nfamily.     \n  The Victims\u2019 Charter sets down principles such as respectful treatment of victims, respect for  victims\u2019 \nprivacy, and ensuring victims are  given information about any  criminal case brought to  court. However, a \nbreach of those rights does not entitle the victim to  take  civil action to  enforce them.  \n  In addition to  the principles contained in the Victims\u2019 Charter, a number of other sta tutes provide \nsome protections for  victims, and can be considered to  be rights available to  victims.  \n  Three of the rights given to  victims are  listed in Source 1.

Instead, the cross-examination must be \nconducted by the accused\u2019s legal representative. If the accused does not have any legal representation (i.e. he or she is self-represented), the court must order Victoria Legal Aid (VLA) to provide legal representation for the accused for the purposes of cross-examination.\nThese measures ensure that the protected witness does not have any direct communication with \nthe accused in court. It avoids the situation where the accused can cross-examine their victim about the evidence they have given.\nSpecial arrangements for persons under the age of 18 \nyears or with a cognitive impairment\nSpecial protections are also available to witnesses under the age of 18 years, or with a cognitive \nimpairment, in criminal proceedings for:\n\u2022 a s exual o\ufb00ence\n\u2022 an indictable o\ufb00ence involving assault on, or injury or threat of injury to a person\u2022  o\ufb00ences involving minor assaults where those assaults relate to one of the above two o\ufb00ences.These witnesses will be allowed to give their examination-in-chief by way of audio or audio-visual \nrecording.

The protections include being able to give evidence at a special hearing conducted in a way that:\n\u2022 the accused is not in the same room as the complainant for the special hearing\u2022 the accused is not entitled to see and hear the complainant while the complainant is giving evidence\n\u2022 no unauthorised person is to be present in the courtroom while evidence is being given\u2022 the evidence must be given on closed-circuit television\u2022 the complainant is not to be questioned unless the court gives leave (that is, the court must make an \norder saying that this is allowed).These protections recognise that children and persons with a cognitive impairment are particularly \nvulnerable, and as much protection should be a\ufb00orded to them as possible while they are giving evidence. \nThe protections aim to reduce the exposure of vulnerable witnesses to the accused, to the formality of the courtroom, and to any fear they may feel as a result of giving evidence about a crime they have been a\ufb00ected by.\nLegislation was passed in 2017 which will mean that these special arrangements can also be available \nin cases involving family violence o\ufb00ences.\nIn South Australia, \nspecial arrangements for giving evidence are available to a wider group of people than in Victoria.

Often an accused \nhasn\u2019t had experience with the criminal justice system, doesn\u2019t know their rights, and doesn\u2019t understand \nkey concepts such as the burden of/uni00A0proof.\nThe High Court has ruled that if a person is charged with a serious indictable o\ufb00ence and, through no fault \nof their own, is unrepresented, they should be given the opportunity to seek legal representation. This is based on the principle that every accused person has the right to receive a fair trial, and that legal representation is necessary for a fair trial of a serious criminal o\ufb00ence. A/uni00A0court can adjourn a trial if the accused doesn\u2019t have legal representation, can\u2019t a\ufb00ord a lawyer and won\u2019t get a fair trial if they aren\u2019t represented.\nIf an accused can\u2019t a\ufb00ord legal representation, government- funded institutions such as Victoria Legal \nAid (VLA) and Victorian community legal centres (CLCs) may be able to help/uni00A0them.\nVictoria Legal/uni00A0Aid\nVLA is a government agency that provides free legal advice to the community, and low- co st or \nno- co st legal representation for people who can\u2019t \na\ufb00ord to pay for a lawyer. VLA helps people with legal problems, and focuses on people who need it the most and can\u2019t get legal assistance any other/uni00A0way.\nVLA \u2019s vision is a fair and just society where \nrights and responsibilities are upheld. Its purpose is to make a di\ufb00erence by resolving and preventing legal problems, and encouraging a fair and transparent justice system.\nRole/uni00A0of/uni00A0VLA\nThe objectives of VLA are/uni00A0to:\n\u2022 provide legal aid in the most e\ufb00ective, economic and e\ufb03cient/uni00A0manner\u2022 mana ge its resources to make legal aid available at a reasonable cost to the community and on an \nequitable basis throughout Victoria\n\u2022 provide the community with improved access to justice and legal remedies\u2022 pur sue innovative means to provide legal aid to minimise the need for individual legal services in the \ncommunity.\nThe most critical role VLA plays is to provide legal aid to accused people. In the 2015\u2013 16 \ufb01nancial \nyear, VLA helped 86 847 di\ufb00erent clients (i.e. people who accessed one or more legal services). Of these, \n48 511 clients were assisted in criminal/uni00A0cases.\n\u2018Legal aid\u2019 includes legal education and information, legal advice and legal representation. Legal \nadvice is normally limited to advice and information about the law and how it applies to a particular \ncase. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the lawyer giving that advice formally represents the accused. Legal representation means that VLA will \u2018represent\u2019 the accused in the case (that is, VLA will be on record as the accused\u2019s lawyer).Free legal aid has \nexisted in Victoria for more than 100/uni00A0years. In 1978, the Legal Aid Commission of Victoria was set up as an independent statutory body (after the Victorian Parliament passed the Legal Aid Act 1978 [Vic]). In 1995, it changed its name to Victoria Legal/uni00A0Aid.Did you know?Source 1 The high cost of the justice system and \nthe need for legal aid has been an issue in Victoria for more than 100/uni00A0years.\nVictoria Legal Aid/uni00A0(VLA) a government agency that provides free legal advice to the community and low-cost or no-cost legal representation to people who can\u2019t afford a lawyer\ncommunity legal \ncentre (CLC)/uni00A0 an independent organisation that provides free legal services to people who are unable to pay for those services.

The income test is for people who need advice or representation from a duty lawyer on a particular day.

While serving that prison sentence, on 28 May 2015 he was sentenced for several new offences, including rape, in the County Court after three separate trials were held. A/uni00A0new non- parole period of 43/uni00A0years was imposed on Bayley.\nBayley requested leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal against \nthe convictions in two of the three trials and the sentences imposed in all three trials. He applied to VLA for legal assistance.\nHis application was refused, and he asked for a review of the \ndecision of VLA. The independent reviewer confirmed the decisions to refuse legal assistance, and noted that the public needed to be confident in VLA, and that it was unreasonable to provide Bayley with legal assistance. \nBayley obtained pro bono (free) legal assistance and appealed \nthe reviewer\u2019s decision to the Supreme Court of Victoria. Justice Bell noted that the provision of legal aid is closely connected with human rights, and that legal aid can be critical for people who are seeking vindication of their rights through the legal process. Justice Bell found that it was unlawful to reject an application for legal assistance on the sole ground that the person is \u2018a notorious \nand unpopular individual who has already been convicted of and sentenced to heinous crimes\u2019. He concluded that the review was invalid and that Bayley\u2019s application should be heard before a different reviewer.\nBayley filed a second application with VLA, but that application was also refused. Pro \nbono lawyers represented him at his appeal in relation to the sentences and convictions. On \n13 July 2016, the Court of Appeal handed down its decision and fixed a new non- parole period of 40/uni00A0years, reducing Bayley\u2019s sentence by three years. In handing down its decision the Court of Appeal said (in/uni00A02016):\nWe wish to acknowledge the assistance given to the Court by senior and junior counsel who \nappeared pro bono on the applicant\u2019s behalf, as did their instructing solicitors. Legal aid \nwas, we were told, declined for the preparation and presentation of the applications in this Court. We were not told why that was/uni00A0so.\nIn our opinion, that decision was regrettable. The applicant\u2019s case required the \nassistance of experienced and competent counsel. He was in no position adequately to represent himself. Any proper appraisal of the available material would have made it abundantly clear that, at worst, the applicant had a strongly arguable case for acquittal in relation to the convictions that he sustained in the first trial. As regards the third trial, his application, though ultimately unsuccessful before this Court, was at least arguable.LEGAL\nCASE\nSource 4 Adrian Bayley was successful on \nappeal in reducing his total sentence for offences not related to Jill Meagher.The Adrian Bayley case is an example of VLA refusing to provide legal assistance because helping the \naccused wouldn\u2019t bene\ufb01t the public.\n04_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   80 9/10/2017   4:11 PM",

As \nindependent organisations they provide free legal services, including advice, information and representation, to people who are unable to access other legal services. There are two types of community legal centres:\n\u2022 generalist CLCs provide broad legal services to people in a particular local geographical area (e.g. \nBarwon Community Legal Service Inc and Monash Oakleigh Legal Service are generalist CLCs that \nserve their respective local/uni00A0areas)\n\u2022 specialist CLCs focus on a particular group of people or area of law (e.g. Y outhLaw provides free legal services for people under/uni00A025).\nThere are approximately 50 CLCs in Victoria.

In April 2017, the \nCommonwealth Government announced it would reverse the proposed 30 per cent cut and would provide an additional $39/uni00A0million for CLCs over three years. The Victorian Government in their May 2017 budget/uni00A0also pledged $29.5 million for VLA and CLCs.

At the committal \nhearing, the accused has the opportunity to question the prosecution\u2019s witnesses and make submissions about the charges. After the evidence and submissions, the magistrate decides whether or not to commit the accused (i.e. send the accused to trial).\nIf the magistrate \ufb01nds there is evidence (of a su\ufb03cient weight) to support a conviction at trial, the \naccused is committed to stand trial and released on bail to wait for the trial, or is held in remand.\nIf the magistrate decides there is not enough evidence (of su\ufb03cient weight) to support a conviction, \nthe accused is discharged and allowed to go free. If further evidence is found in the future, the accused can be brought before the court again, because the committal proceeding is not a trial and the accused has not been found guilty or not guilty.

The DPP \ufb01les an indictment in the Supreme Court or the County Court. The indictment is a written statement of the details of the charge against the accused. The \ufb01ling of an indictment will commence the criminal proceeding in the higher court and ultimately leads to a trial before a judge and jury to determine/uni00A0guilt.\nIf the accused pleads guilty at any time during the committal proceeding, the criminal case will be \nlisted for a plea hearing in the County Court or the Supreme/uni00A0Court.\nStrengths and weaknesses of committal \nproceedings\nSet out below are some strengths and weaknesses of committal proceedings. \nStrengths\n\u2022 Committ al proceedings help to save the time and resources of higher courts by \ufb01ltering out the \nweak cases that are unlikely to succeed because of insu\ufb03cient prosecution evidence.\n\u2022 T he committal process allows the accused to be informed of the prosecution\u2019s case against them. \nThis could help them decide whether to plead guilty or not guilty, and also help them to prepare their \ncase without being ambushed by unexpected witnesses.\n\u2022 T he onus is on the prosecution to establish to the court that there is enough evidence (of su\ufb03cient \nweight) to support conviction at trial. If they cannot do that, the accused is discharged. This onus supports the principle that the accused is innocent until proven guilty and doesn\u2019t need to prove anything at this/uni00A0stage.\n\u2022 T he prosecution is given the opportunity to withdraw some charges or combine charges  \nafter the evidence has been considered. This helps achieve a fairer trial and save the time of the higher/uni00A0court.\n\u2022 T he accused has the opportunity to test the strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. This includes \nthe opportunity to examine prosecution witnesses. This can lead to the accused pleading guilty or agreeing on some facts or issues with the prosecution, and saves the time and resources of the courts.\nWeaknesses\n\u2022 Committ al proceedings are very complicated. \nThey can involve cross- examination of witnesses and making submissions (arguments) to the court. The committal hearing is one of many hearings that take place in the committal proceedings. Without experience with the processes, and without the aid of a legal representative, the accused can \ufb01nd it hard to understand, which could increase the risk of an unfair outcome. It can also result in inequality between a very experienced prosecutor, and an inexperienced accused person.The DPP can skip the \ncommittal proceeding stage and file a direct indictment. However, this only occurs if the prosecution has a strong case and wants to avoid the distress, expense and time involved in committal proceedings.Did you know?\nIf you are answering a question about committal proceedings, link the strengths and weaknesses back to the three principles of justice in Chapter/uni00A03.

Only the courts have the power to determine if an accused is guilty and sentence an o\ufb00ender.\nThere are, however, two means that encourage an early determination of a criminal case without the \nneed to go to trial (or hearing in the Magistrates\u2019 Court). They/uni00A0are:\n\u2022 plea negotiations\n\u2022 sentence indications.Y ou will explore plea negotiations in this topic, and sentence indications in Topic 4.4. For each, you \nwill consider their purpose and appropriateness, and their strengths and weaknesses as a means used to \ndetermine a criminal case without going to trial (or a hearing). \nWhat are plea negotiations?\nPlea negotiations are discussions between the prosecutor and the accused about the charges against the accused. They can take place in relation to summary or indictable o\ufb00ences. Plea negotiations can result in an agreement being reached between the prosecutor and the accused about the charges that the accused will plead guilty to. Other terms for plea negotiations are \u2018plea bargaining\u2019 or \u2018charge negotiations\u2019 . \nPlea negotiations usually begin when the accused (or their lawyer) indicates to the prosecution that \nthey are willing to discuss the charges. Negotiations are conducted on a \u2018without prejudice\u2019 basis. This means that any o\ufb00ers made by either party during the negotiations can\u2019t be used against them if the negotiations aren\u2019t successful. Therefore, the accused is free to negotiate with the prosecutor without fear that whatever they say during the negotiations will be used against them at trial or a hearing if the negotiations/uni00A0fail.\nThe agreement reached between the prosecutor and the accused following plea negotiations may \nbe/uni00A0that:\n\u2022 the accused pleads guilty to fewer charges, with the remaining charges not proceeding\u2022 the accused pleads guilty to a lesser charge (a charge for an alternative o\ufb00ence with a lower maximum \npenalty). For example, a person charged with culpable driving causing death could negotiate to have this changed to dangerous driving causing death, which carries a lower maximum penalty than culpable driving, on the basis that they plead guilty to that charge.\nPlea negotiations do not determine the sentence. Following plea negotiations, the accused will still \nneed to be sentenced by a court. The court will be informed of the charges the accused has pleaded guilty \nto, and will decide what sanction to impose.\nPlea negotiations can happen at any stage, and even before the charges have been laid. Victims should \nbe consulted before the plea negotiations, and the victims\u2019 views should be taken into account when deciding to enter into an agreement with the accused. However, the victims\u2019 views are not a deciding factor for the prosecutor to enter into such an agreement.\nPurposes of plea negotiations\nPlea negotiations have two main purposes:\n\u2022 To resolve a criminal case by ensuring a plea of guilty to a charge that adequately re\ufb02ects the \ncrime that was committed. The charges must adequately re\ufb02ect the accused\u2019s wrongdoing. civil dispute \na dispute (i.e. disagreement) between two or more individuals (or groups) in which one of the individuals (or groups) makes a legal claim against the other\nplea negotiations \n(in criminal cases) pre-trial discussions that take place between the prosecution and the accused, aimed at resolving the case by agreeing on an outcome to the criminal charges laid (also known as charge negotiations)\nsentence indication \na statement made by a judge to an accused about the sentence they could face if they plead guilty to an offence\n04_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   88 9/10/2017   4:11 PM",

McVeigh boarded the vessel with other passengers, and on arrival at the swimming area, he and other passengers entered the water. Torie MacKinnon was in charge of the vessel.\nThe vessel drifted away from the swimmers and MacKinnon went to reverse the vessel. \nMcVeigh was on the vessel at the time and wanted a crew member to take a photo of him. Without warning he jumped into the water. Almost immediately, McVeigh was pushed underneath the vessel, was struck by a rotating propeller and suffered life- threatening injuries. He passed away as a result of the injuries.SENTENCE INDICATIONS 4.4 \nIn 2008, the sentence indication regime was introduced in Victoria. It is another method (other than plea negotiations) used to encourage an early determination of a criminal/uni00A0case. \nWhat are sentence indications?\nA sentence indication is given by a court to the accused to let the accused know what sanction is likely \nto be imposed on them. It is intended to give the accused a broad idea of the sentence they are likely to get if they plead guilty to the o\ufb00ence at a particular point in/uni00A0time.\nSentence indications can be given for either indictable o\ufb00ences or summary o\ufb00ences. It is a means, \nother than plea negotiations, that can be used to encourage an accused to plead guilty and possibly \ufb01nalise a criminal charge without the need for a full trial or hearing. Unlike plea negotiations, sentence indications involve the court, in that the court provides the accused with an idea of the likely sentence that would be imposed. \nSentence indications for indictable offences\nThe Criminal Procedure Act allows sentence indications to be given by the County Court and the Supreme \nCourt for indictable o\ufb00ences. At any time after the indictment is \ufb01led, the court (i.e. the judge) may indicate that if the accused pleads guilty to the charge, the court is (or is not) likely to impose an immediate term of imprisonment.\nA sentence indication can only be given if the accused applies for one and the prosecution agrees. It \ncan only be given once during the proceeding (unless the prosecution otherwise consents). The court can refuse to give a sentence indication; for example, if it considers there is insu\ufb03cient information about any impact of the o\ufb00ence on victims. The fact that the accused asked for a sentence indication cannot be used against him or her as evidence that he or she is guilty if the matter proceeds to trial. \nIf the court indicates that it is not likely to impose an immediate term of imprisonment and the accused \npleads guilty at the \ufb01rst available opportunity, then the court must not impose a sentence of imprisonment.\nIf the accused asks for a sentence indication but does not plead guilty at the \ufb01rst available opportunity, \na di\ufb00erent judge must preside over the trial. The sentence indication will not bind the trial/uni00A0judge.\nAn example of a sentence indication leading to a guilty plea can be seen in the R v MacKinnon [2015] \nVSC 619 case.sentence indication \na statement made by a judge to an accused about the sentence they could face if they plead guilty to an offence\nsummary o\ufb00ence \na minor offence generally heard in the Magistrates\u2019 Court\nimprisonment \na sanction that involves the removal of the offender from society for a stated period of time and placing them in prison\nLEGAL\nCASE\n04_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   92 9/10/2017   4:11 PM",

On 19 October 2015, the Supreme Court heard an  application by  MacKinnon for  a sentence indication on  the \ncharge of dangerous driving causing death.

The purpose of a sentence indication is to provide the accused with some clarity about the likely sentence that will be imposed, so that they can make an early decision to plead guilty and alleviate the fear that they will receive a custodial sentence.\nProviding the accused with a sentence indication can also save the time, costs, resources, stress \nand inconvenience of having a contested trial (or hearing) that may result in a higher sentence.\nEarlier guilty pleas are also desirable because they help to bring an earlier closure for the victims and \ntheir families, signify an accused\u2019s willingness to accept responsibility for their actions, reduce the need for lengthy trials and free up the resources of the justice system for other matters. The o\ufb00ender bene\ufb01ts from an early guilty plea because he or she is likely to receive a shorter sentence by avoiding the need for a trial or hearing.\nAppropriateness of sentence indications\nA sentence indication may be appropriate to encourage the early \ufb01nalisation of a criminal case, but whether it is appropriate in a particular case depends on a number of factors:\n\u2022 whether the accused has applied for a sentence indication \u2022 for indictable o\ufb00ences, whether a sentence indication has already been given. A/uni00A0sentence indication \nmay be given only once during a proceeding for an indictable o\ufb00ence, unless the prosecution consents \nto another indication being/uni00A0given \n\u2022 the type of o\ufb00ence and the court hearing the charges. Sentence indications are more likely to be \nappropriate in the Magistrates\u2019 Court and the County Court. O\ufb00ences heard in the Supreme Court are of such a severity that an accused who is found guilty will usually receive a custodial sentence\n\u2022 whether there is su\ufb03cient information for the judge or magistrate to make an indication, including information about the impact of the o\ufb00ence on the victim. If this information is not available to the judge or magistrate, a sentence indication may not be appropriate \n\u2022 whether the accused is charged with an indictable o\ufb00ence and the prosecution consents to the sentence indication. A/uni00A0sentence indication cannot be given for an indictable o\ufb00ence if the prosecution does not consent \n\u2022 the strength of the evidence against the accused, and whether the accused has raised a legitimate defence\n\u2022 the nature of the o\ufb00ence. The Sentencing Advisory Council has said that sentence indications may not be appropriate for sex o\ufb00ence cases, given their sensitivity, but they may be more useful in drug or fraud/uni00A0cases.\nThe article below is an example of an accused waiting to know a sentence indication before deciding \non a plea.\nSentencing Advisory \nCouncil an independent statutory body that provides statistics on sentencing in Victoria, conducts research, seeks public opinion and advises the Victorian Government on sentencing matters\nGeelong court:/uni00A0Alleged thief will fight charges\nKaren Matthews, Geelong Advertiser, 22 April/uni00A02015\nA BELL Post Hill man will contest multiple charges of burglary and theft after rejecting a \nsentence indication of 15/uni00A0months\u2019 jail with a non- parole period of nine months.\nShane Bausch, 23, of Ruhamah Ave, appeared in Geelong court facing multiple counts of \nburglary and/uni00A0theft.IN \nTHE \nNEWSSentencing Advisory \nCouncil an independent statutory body that provides statistics on sentencing in Victoria, conducts research, seeks public opinion and advises the Victorian Government on sentencing matters\n04_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   94 6/12/2017   12:42 PM",

This results in prompt justice rather than delayed justice. A/uni00A0prompt determination can bene\ufb01t everyone involved, including victims, witnesses, the accused, families and the community.\n\u2022 It can save money and resources. Not having to take the case to trial saves the prosecution and the community/uni00A0costs.\n\u2022 It can be conducted in open court. This means there is transparency in the indication that the judge gives, rather than the secrecy that may apply to plea negotiations.\n\u2022 T he accused is not bound to accept the indication and plead guilty. This provides procedural fairness \nto the accused.\n\u2022 T he indication is given by an experienced and impartial judge or magistrate who has expertise in the \narea of law and in sentencing. This may give the accused more con\ufb01dence about the appropriateness of the sentence.\n\u2022 T he accused has greater certainty about what sentence they will receive. This avoids the risk of going \nto trial and only \ufb01nding out at the end what sentence will be imposed.\n\u2022 It can minimise the trauma, stress and inconvenience of victims and witnesses if a sentence \nindication is given early, before they have to go through a full trial or hearing, or have to give stressful evidence.\n04_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   95 9/10/2017   4:11 PM",
  "Page 108": "96  UNIT 3  RIGHTS AND JUSTICE\u2022 Any victim impact st atement can be considered by a judge when giving an indication. This allows \nthe victim a voice in the process.\n\u2022 If  the accused pleads guilty at the earliest possible time after the sentence indication, they can\u2019t \nreceive a greater sentence than was indicated for a summary o\ufb00ence. They also can\u2019t receive a \nterm of imprisonment for an indictable o\ufb00ence if the judge indicated that there would be no term \nof imprisonment.\n\u2022 If  the accused asks for a sentence indication but does not plead guilty, a di\ufb00erent judge or magistrate \nwill hear the trial or hearing. This means that the accused won\u2019t be bound by the sentence indication, the judge or magistrate will not be informed of it, and the trial will be able to proceed fairly. For jury trials, the jury will also not know of the sentence indication.\n\u2022 An y application for a sentence indication, and the indication given by the judge or magistrate are not \nadmissible in evidence if the accused chooses to proceed to trial. This means that the accused can seek a sentence indication and not have to worry about the fact that seeking the indication, or the actual indication, may be used against him or her at the \ufb01nal hearing or/uni00A0trial.\nWeaknesses\n\u2022 T he judge is not obliged to grant the accused\u2019s request for the sentence indication. This may \nbe seen to be unfair if the accused is willing to consider pleading guilty on the basis of the sentence indication.\n\u2022 In the higher courts, the prosecutor must consent to the indication being given, therefore limiting the availability of the regime where the prosecutor, for whatever reason, does not consent. Some defence practitioners have indicated that the regime should be changed so that consent is not required.\n\u2022 Legisla tion allows the court to close a proceeding to the public when a sentence indication is given. \nThis means there will be a lack of transparency about what occurred.\n\u2022 F or indictable o\ufb00ences, the court only needs to give an indication if it would impose an immediate \nterm of imprisonment.  This means that the accused will not necessarily know what sentence \nmay be imposed (but will know whether a term of imprisonment will be imposed). This provides the accused with less certainty about the type of sentence that he or she will actually receive. \n\u2022 T he sentence indication may be given before all the facts have been admitted or proved. This may \ndisadvantage an o\ufb00ender who has pleaded guilty, because it commits them to a particular sentence that might turn out to be di\ufb00erent after all the facts are brought out in a/uni00A0trial.\n\u2022 It may lessen the impact or need for a victim impact statement because the court won\u2019t need to hear as much evidence to decide on the sentence (i.e. the sentence has already been indicated). However, the court can refuse to give a sentence indication if there is insu\ufb03cient information about the impact of the o\ufb00ence on any victim. So it can be assumed that a court will determine the impact on victims before giving a sentence indication.\n\u2022 It denies the victim their \u2018day in court\u2019.

They  are ranked based \non the severity and complexity of the cases they can/uni00A0hear. The  Magistrates\u2019 Court is at  the bottom of the \nhierarchy and the Supreme Court of Victoria (divided into the Trial Division and the Court of Appeal) \nis the highest state  court. It deals with the most serious (indictable) o\ufb00ences. Each court has its own  \njurisdiction (powers) to  hear criminal cases.\nJurisdiction can be broken down into two  types:\n\u2022 Original jurisdiction is the power of a court to  hear a case for  the \ufb01rst/uni00A0time.\n\u2022 Appellate jurisdiction is the ability of a court to  hear a case in which a decision is being reviewed or \nchallenged on a particular ground (i.e. being appealed to  a higher court).\nAs you  learned in Chapter/uni00A03, the Magistrates\u2019 Court hears summary o\ufb00ences. The  County Court and \nthe Supreme Court hear indictable o\ufb00ences, with the Supreme Court generally hearing the most serious \nindictable o\ufb00ences (e.g. murder, manslaughter, attempted murder).\nThe High Court is a federal court. The  High Court hears appeals from the state  and territory Courts of  \nAppeal. The  High Court needs to  give  leave (consent) to  a party who wants to  appeal. \nSource 1 The Victorian court hierarchy, including state  courts and the High Court (a federal court).\nThe opening of the \nlegal year takes place in February. Judges attend church services wearing formal robes, and there is a breakfast for practitioners in \nHardware Lane, Melbourne. In May each year the Victorian legal profession holds Law Week, which includes Courts Open Day with tours, exhibitions and mock trials.Did you know?There are  many reasons for  a court hierarchy, two  of which are  specialisation and appeals.\nSpecialisation of courts\nWithin the hierarchy of courts, the courts have  been able to  develop their own  areas of expertise or \nspecialisation. In relation to  criminal/uni00A0cases:\n\u2022 the Supreme Court (Court of Appeal) specialises in determining criminal appeals in indictable \no\ufb00ences, and has particular expertise in sentencing principles\n\u2022 the Supreme Court (Trial Division) hears the most serious indictable o\ufb00ences (e.g. murder and \nmanslaughter) and will have  developed its own  specialisation in those areas/uni00A0of/uni00A0law\n\u2022 the County Court and the Supreme Court have  developed expertise in hearing more complex cases \ninvolving indictable o\ufb00ences (e.g. rape  and homicide/uni00A0cases)Supreme Court of Victoria \n(Court of Appeal)High Court of Australia\n(Federal)\nSupreme Court of Victoria \n(Trial Division)\nCounty Court of Victoria  \nMagistrates\u2019 Court of Victoria  Children\u2019s Court Coroners Court Victorian hierarchy of courtsjurisdiction the lawful authority (i.e. power) of a court, tribunal or other dispute resolution body to decide legal cases\noriginal jurisdiction the power of a court to  \nhear a case for the first time (i.e. not on appeal from a lower  court)\nappellate jurisdiction the power of a court to  \nhear a case on appeal\n04_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   98 9/10/2017   4:11 PM",

Knowing how each of them are specialised in criminal cases, and their role in the appeal process, is important.\nStudy tip\u2022 the Magistrates\u2019 Court is familiar with cases involving summary o\ufb00ences that need to be dealt with \nquickly and e\ufb03ciently (e.g. drink- driving and tra\ufb03c o\ufb00ences)\n\u2022 other specialist courts such as the Children\u2019s Court and Coroners Court deal with specialised \ncases, including where young people have been charged with a/uni00A0crime.\nAppeals\nIf there are grounds for appeal, a party who is dissatis\ufb01ed with a decision in a criminal case can take the matter to a higher court to challenge the decision. A/uni00A0party who appeals is known as the appellant, and the other party is the respondent. The system of appeals provides fairness and allows for any mistakes made in the original decision to be corrected. If there were no higher courts, there could be no system of appeals, which would create unfairness if a court incorrectly determined a/uni00A0case. \nGrounds for appeal in a criminal case can include:\n\u2022 a ppealing on a question of law (where some law has not been followed, e.g. the court was allowed to \nhear inadmissible evidence)\n\u2022 appealing a conviction\n\u2022 a ppealing because of the severity (or leniency) of a sanction imposed. The prosecution will appeal \non leniency, and the o\ufb00ender will appeal because of severity. An o\ufb00ender will usually appeal the \nsentence on the basis that it was \u2018manifestly excessive\u2019 .\nIn some circumstances, the appellant will need the leave (consent) of the court. This includes where \nan o\ufb00ender is appealing a conviction or sentence to the Court of Appeal, or appealing a decision of the \nCourt of Appeal to the High/uni00A0Court.\nSummary of the criminal jurisdiction of \nVictorian/uni00A0courts\nThe following table sets out the criminal jurisdiction (both original and appellate) of the main Victorian \ncourts.\nAn example of an appeal on leniency is provided on the next page, where a man\u2019s sentence was \nincreased.\n04_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   99 9/10/2017   4:11 PM",

This can involve controlling witnesses and legal practitioners.\nThe judge has powers to give directions and make orders during the trial, including how evidence is \nto be given, what documents the jury should see, and whether there will be separate trials (if there is more than one accused).\nThe judge might ask occasional questions, recall a witness for a matter to be clari\ufb01ed, or call a new \nwitness with the permission of both sides. However, they are not active participants in the trial, and they do not take sides. They do not take an active part beyond clearing up ambiguities in points that have already been made. They do not try to make up for a barrister who is not doing an adequate/uni00A0job.\nCook v The Queen [2016] VSCA 174 is an example of the Court of Appeal considering whether the \njudge in a criminal case appropriately managed the trial.\nHeated exchanges between judge and barrister \nconsidered by Court of/uni00A0Appeal\nCook v The Queen [2016] VSCA 174 (25 July/uni00A02016)\nOn 25 March 2015 the applicant was convicted on two counts of armed robbery in the County \nCourt. He appealed against his conviction on various grounds, including that the trial judge repeatedly interrupted cross- examination in both trials, interjected on too many occasions, descended \u2018to the arena\u2019 and \u2018donned the mantle of the prosecution\u2019. He also appealed on the ground that the judge was biased. The applicant was self- represented at the appeal.\nThe Court of Appeal considered in detail the transcript of the trial and the dealings between \nthe judge and the barrister for the accused. Some parts of the transcript showed heated exchanges between the judge and the barrister for the accused (after the jury had been sent out). The Court of Appeal noted that \u2018it clearly emerges that the judge was highly unimpressed by forensic decisions being made by defence counsel\u2019. It stated:\nNo matter what view a judge has of the manner in which counsel is running the case, to \ninsult and demean counsel, even in the absence of the jury, is not only likely to offend and embarrass counsel but also to risk impeding counsel in conducting the trial and thus risk giving rise to a miscarriage of justice.\nIt went on to say that exchanges like those between the judge and the barrister may give rise \nto an apprehension that the accused is not being treated fairly by the/uni00A0judge.\nUltimately, the Court of Appeal decided that the grounds of appeal had not been made \nout, and there was no ground for considering that a reasonable apprehension of bias was \ndemonstrated.

  "Page 115": "103  CHAPTER  4 DETERMINING A/uni00A0CRIMINAL/uni00A0CASEIn trials, there are rules about how evidence can be given, and what evidence is admissible. \nThe Evidence Act 2008 (Vic) is the main statute that governs the admissibility of evidence. \nDuring a trial, the judge will often need to make decisions about whether evidence is \nadmissible. For example:\n\u2013 evidence must be relevant to the issues in dispute\u2013 in most instances, hearsay evidence is not admissible. Hearsay evidence is when a witness \nrelies on something that someone else said about a situation, but the witness did not actually see what happened. There are some exceptions to the hearsay evidence rule, including where the person who made the statement to the witness is not available to give evidence and certain circumstances exist (e.g. it is highly probable that the representation is reliable) \n\u2013 evidence of an opinion is generally not admissible. If someone \u2018thinks\u2019 that the accused \ncommitted the crime, this is not admissible. There are some exceptions to this/uni00A0rule.\n\u2022 Attend to/uni00A0jury matters\nAt the start of a trial, the judge will provide the potential jurors with information about the trial and the accused to make sure that any person can be excused from being a juror if something about the case will a\ufb00ect their ability to act as a juror (e.g. they know the accused or witnesses).\nAt any time during a trial, the judge may address the jury about the issues in the trial, the relevance \nof any admissions made, or any other matter that may be relevant to the jury, including giving a direction to the jury about any issue of law, evidence or procedure.\nA judge may have to discharge a juror if it appears that the juror is not impartial, is ill, can\u2019t continue \nto act as a juror, or shouldn\u2019t continue to/uni00A0act.\n\u2022 Give directions to/uni00A0the jury and sum up/uni00A0the/uni00A0case\nDuring trial, the judge may need to give directions to the jury to ensure a fair trial. This may include telling the jury that the accused is not required to give evidence, and the jury should not assume the accused must be guilty because he or she didn\u2019t give evidence. Legislative changes were made in 2015 to reduce the complexity of jury directions in criminal trials so that they are easier for jurors to understand.\nOnce trial has concluded, the judge will need to summarise the case to the jury. They must explain \nthe law involved, identify the evidence that will assist the jury and refer to the way the parties have put their/uni00A0cases.\n\u2022 Hand down/uni00A0a sentence\nIf a jury \ufb01nds an accused guilty, or the accused pleads guilty, the case will be set down for a plea hearing and the parties will make submissions about sentencing. Following that hearing, the judge must hand down a sentence. The judge must follow the sentencing guidelines established in the Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic) and comply with legislation about the sentence that should be imposed.\n\u2022 Other responsibilities\nIn addition to these main responsibilities, the judge must also:\n\u2013 order that the VLA provide legal representation \u2013 If a judge is satis\ufb01ed that the court can\u2019t \nprovide the accused with a fair trial unless the accused is legally represented, and the accused is \nunable to a\ufb00ord the full cost of obtaining their own private legal practitioner, the judge may order VLA to provide legal representation. They can then adjourn the trial until that legal representation has been provided.\n\u2013 be familiar with technology \u2013 Judges are expected to be able to use technology. As discussed in \nChapter/uni00A03, this includes closed- circuit television for vulnerable witnesses to give evidence.Source 2 You can\u2019t \nuse something someone told you as proof that what they said was true. That is hearsay evidence, and it is generally not allowed in court. There are some exceptions to this/uni00A0rule.\nCollect articles about criminal trials.

The jury system provides the opportunity for community \nparticipation in the legal process, and for the law to be applied according to community standards.\nAs you learned in Chapter/uni00A03, an accused person has a right to trial by jury where they have pleaded \nnot guilty to an indictable o\ufb00ence. Therefore, criminal trials in the County Court and the Supreme Court of Victoria are generally jury trials. A/uni00A0jury is not used for sentencing.\nThe criminal jury is the decider of the facts. In other words, it makes a decision about which facts it \nbelieves to be true. For example, was the accused actually at the scene of the crime, or at the cinema as she said? Did the witness actually see the accused or was the witness mistaken?\nComposition of/uni00A0a criminal/uni00A0jury\nA criminal jury comprises 12 jurors. They are chosen randomly from people eligible to vote and who are on the electoral/uni00A0roll.\nSome members of society are disquali\ufb01ed (e.g. some prisoners) or ineligible \n(e.g. lawyers and police o\ufb03cers) from being on a jury. Others can be excused if they have a valid reason (e.g. they are signi\ufb01cantly unwell). Potential jurors can also be challenged by the prosecution or the defence, with or without a reason (but they are limited in the number of people they can challenge without good reason).\nResponsibilities of/uni00A0a criminal/uni00A0jury\nThe jurors must take the job of being on a jury very seriously and make every e\ufb00ort to reach the right decision. Each juror must make their own decision without undue in\ufb02uence from other jurors.\nIn a criminal trial the jury has the following responsibilities:\n\u2022 Be objecti ve\nThe jury must be unbiased and bring an open mind to the task, putting aside any prejudices or preconceived ideas. A/uni00A0jury member must have no connection with any of the parties, and must also ensure they decide whether the accused person is guilty or not guilty based on the facts and not on their own biases.\nThe case below is an example of a jury being discharged because a jury member had a connection \nwith one of the parties in the case.Source 4  Twelve people are needed to \nform a jury in a criminal/uni00A0trial.\nTrial to restart after Vic jury discharged\nAAP, news.com.au, 6 October/uni00A02015\nThe trial of a former Melbourne Grammar student accused of murdering a homeless man will \nstart again after it was aborted.\nVictorian Supreme Court Justice Jane Dixon discharged the jury on Monday, the second \nmorning of the trial of Easton George Woodhead, 20, after one juror raised concerns about links shared with the Woodhead family.\nWoodhead is charged with murdering Morgan Wayne \u2018Mouse\u2019 Perry, 42, last/uni00A0year.\nHe has pleaded not guilty.Prosecutor Michele Williams applied for the jury to be discharged after the juror raised \nthese concerns.\nA new jury is expected to be empanelled on Tuesday.IN \nTHE \nNEWSIn a British murder trial \nin 1994, four jurors who were staying overnight in a hotel during deliberations conducted a s\u00e9ance to ask one of the victims who committed the murder.

The jury members will need to be able to make sense of all this/uni00A0evidence.\nJurors can take notes if it helps them to remember information, but they must make sure they \ncontinue to concentrate on what is taking place in the courtroom. In the past, a jury has been discharged because a jury member fell asleep.\nA jury mustn\u2019t undertake their own investigations of what happened, conduct any research on \nthe case, or make any enquiries about trial matters. This can include using the internet to search for information. Doing so can lead to penalties and the discharge of the/uni00A0jury.\n\u2022 Understand directions and summing/uni00A0up\nAt the conclusion of a trial, the judge will give directions to the jury about issues or points of law, and will sum up the case. The jury is required to listen to the directions and the summing up given by the judge, and can ask for an explanation about any legal point they don\u2019t understand.\nFor example, in sexual o\ufb00ence cases, the trial judge may give directions to the jury about the \nmeaning of \u2018consent\u2019 ,\n including a direction that just because a person did not protest or physically \nresist the accused before or during the sexual act does not mean they consented.\n\u2022 Deliver a verdict\nThe jury must take part in the deliberations in the jury room and form an opinion about which party\u2019s story or arguments they believe. Deliberations should be undertaken freely and without any coercion of one juror by another to reach a verdict. Deliberations are con\ufb01dential. Evidence about what happens during deliberations is not generally admissible or allowed to be disclosed, so that jurors can be free to be candid about their/uni00A0views.\nThe jury must make a decision on the facts of the case. In a criminal trial, this means the jury \nmust decide whether the accused is guilty. A/uni00A0criminal jury must aim to reach a unanimous verdict. If they are unable to agree on a verdict, the court may accept a majority verdict unless the accused is charged with murder, treason or certain drug o\ufb00ences. The court may also accept a guilty verdict for an alternative o\ufb00ence.\nAn interesting legal case that demonstrates the importance of jury deliberations being undertaken \nfreely and without coercion is provided below.\nJuror coerced into making decision\nSmith v Western Australia (2014) 250 CLR/uni00A0473\nIn Smith v Western Australia, a note was found in the jury room after the jury had decided \nthe case. The note implied that one juror had been physically threatened to agree with the majority so a decision could be reached. The jury had found the accused guilty on two counts of indecently dealing with a child under the age of 13/uni00A0years. The foreperson (i.e. the head juror chosen to be spokesperson for the jury) was asked, in accordance with usual practice, if the verdict was the verdict of all the jury, and he said it/uni00A0was.\nSmith appealed the conviction on the grounds that the \u2018trial had miscarried due to a juror \nbeing physically coerced into changing his verdict to one of guilty\u2019. The Court of Appeal dismissed Smith\u2019s appeal on the basis that the common law rule known as the \u2018exclusionary rule\u2019 applied. That rule prevents evidence of jury deliberations being given in a court. LEGAL  \nCASEIn a criminal trial, the \ncourt can order the empanelment of up to three additional jurors, so that there are up to 15 jurors.

The prosecutor can only speak to evidence that has been seen by the accused. \nIf an accused is legally represented, their \nlawyer must present to the jury a response to the prosecution\u2019s opening address. An accused who is not represented does not have to do this.\nLike the prosecution, the accused is restricted \nto relying on evidence set out in materials that have been \ufb01led and served.\n\u2022 Assist the/uni00A0judge in/uni00A0jury matters\nBoth parties assist in empanelling the jury (that is, deciding which 12 people will form the jury panel for the trial). Both parties have the ability to challenge potential jurors, with or without a reason. There is a limit on the number of challenges they can make to jurors without a reason, but there is no limit for challenges where there is a legitimate reason.\nEither party can also request during the trial that the trial judge give directions to the jury.

In a \ncriminal trial, prosecutors are legal practitioners.\nLegal practitioners are subject to various laws that impose duties and obligations on them. The most \nimportant duty is the duty to the court and the administration of justice. Legal practitioners can\u2019t mislead or deceive the court, they can\u2019t place incorrect facts before the court, and they must be honest about the law set out in previous cases (e.g. they shouldn\u2019t argue that the court should follow a particular decision when they know that decision has since been overruled). The legal practitioner\u2019s duty to the court is over and above their duty to the client. This means that they must put the court and the law \ufb01rst, even if it means acting against the client\u2019s wishes.\nThere are two types of legal practitioners that an accused is usually represented by at trial:/uni00A0the solicitor \nand the barrister. Part of the role of the solicitor before trial is to draft documents, communicate with the other party and the court, prepare the case, research the law and develop the evidence, and instruct the barrister (including at trial).

Like the prosecution, the accused is restricted to material already provided to the prosecution. The accused\u2019s legal representative will also address the jury to sum up the evidence after the close of all evidence and after the closing address of the prosecution.\nThe legal practitioner for the accused will also assist in examining and cross- \nexamining witnesses, and make submissions about the appropriate sentence if the \naccused pleads guilty or is found guilty.\n\u2022 Other responsibilities\nIn addition to these main responsibilities, legal practitioners must also take special care for some accused persons, advise the accused about their rights, defend the \naccused irrespective of any belief or opinion and act in a certain manner if the accused has confessed guilt.

The jury \nfound the two men guilty of obtaining a financial advantage by deception, and the judge sentenced them to imprisonment for five years (Gant) and three years (Siddique). However, the judge ordered a stay of the sentences until an appeal was heard. The judge also took the unusual step of writing a report for the Court of Appeal in which he stated that the jury decision was unsafe./uni00A0 \nBoth men appealed, and briefed counsel to prepare their cases. Late in the afternoon \nof the day before the hearing of the appeals, the Director of Public Prosecutions told the Court that he would concede the ground of each appeal.\nJustices Weinberg, Priest and Mcleish criticised the prosecution\u2019s delay in conceding a \nwrong verdict. They also took an unusual step \u2013   issuing an early statement separate from \ntheir judgment./uni00A0 \nIn their statement the Justices said although the Crown\u2019s concession was welcome, \ntheir work had been disrupted. Beyond inconvenience, it prejudiced the rights of other litigants to have their cases heard in a timely manner:\nit is a matter of considerable regret that this Court was not notified until 4.45pm last \nnight that the Crown proposed to make the concession that the applicants\u2019 convictions were unsafe, and should accordingly be quashed.\nA vast amount of time has been spent by the members of this Court, their staff and \nthe Registry in preparation for the hearing of this appeal.\nOn the appeal applications, the Court of Appeal accepted the prosecutor\u2019s concession, \nwhich they said was made \u2018with conspicuous fairness\u2019. They pointed out that the Crown\u2019s \nconcession was not binding on them, as it was \u2018the Court itself which must determine whether the convictions should be set aside.\u2019 However, they agreed that the prosecutor was correct. The convictions were quashed and verdicts of acquittal were entered by the/uni00A0court.\nThe judges also stressed that while the jury does not always \u2018get it right\u2019, it usually/uni00A0does:\nTrial by jury is of fundamental importance to both the rule of law, and to our system \nof criminal justice. It represents perhaps the greatest safeguard that we have of the rights of the individual against the State. There have been literally thousands of criminal trials conducted over the years without anyone being able to demonstrate that the jury, assuming they were properly directed, and the trial was otherwise properly conducted, had wrongly convicted an accused person. This case is a rare and almost unique instance of the system having failed in that regard.\nIt is fortunate that the mechanism of the appeal to this Court, coupled with the \nfairness of the prosecuting authorities in recognising that failure, has resulted in a rectification of that error. However, nothing can ever fully restore the applicants to their original position.LEGAL  \nCASEIn the legal case below, Justices Weinberg, Priest and Mcleish criticised the prosecution for their delay \nin conceding a wrong verdict.\n04_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   111 9/10/2017   4:12 PM",

  "Page 126": "114  UNIT 3  RIGHTS AND JUSTICETHE PURPOSES OF SANCTIONS 4.8 \nIf the accused is found guilty, or if they have pleaded guilty to the charge(s), the judge or magistrate will \ndecide on the appropriate sanction (i.e. sentence). A/uni00A0sanction is a penalty imposed by courts on a person who is guilty of an o\ufb00ence.\nThe Sentencing Act sets out the courts\u2019 powers to impose sanctions and establishes various types of \nsanctions. Two of the purposes of the Sentencing Act/uni00A0are:\n\u2022 to promote consistency of approach in sentencing\u2022 to provide fair procedures for imposing sanctions.\nThe nature of criminal sanctions has changed over time, from harsh, inhumane punishments aimed to \ndeter others and seek revenge for society, to a greater realisation of the needs of o\ufb00enders and the desire \nto reform and rehabilitate/uni00A0them.\nThe purposes of sanctions are set out in section 5(1) of the Sentencing Act. These purposes/uni00A0are:\n\u2022 rehabilitation\n\u2022 punishment\n\u2022 deterrence\n\u2022 denunciation\n\u2022 protection.\nA sentencing judge must take these purposes into consideration when imposing a sentence, but \nmust not impose a sentence that is more severe than necessary to achieve the purposes of the sentence \nimposed (called the principle of parsimony). The purposes often overlap and a sentence can seek to achieve a combination of two or more purposes.\nRehabilitation\nOne purpose of sanctions is rehabilitation (i.e. the treatment of the o\ufb00ender to address the underlying reasons for the crime).\nA court will consider sanctions that could help treat the o\ufb00ender and address the underlying reasons \nfor the o\ufb00ender committing the crime. This aims to assist o\ufb00enders to change their attitudes and behaviour with the goal of preventing them from reo\ufb00ending in future. This can be achieved by giving a community correction order (CCO) to encourage rehabilitation rather than sending o\ufb00enders to prison. A/uni00A0CCO can also help by requiring o\ufb00enders to participate in skills training. Y ou will learn more about CCOs in the next/uni00A0topic.\nAlthough prison is the sanction of last resort, rehabilitation programs are carried out within prisons. \nPrisoners are o\ufb00ered the opportunity to undertake life skills programs such as drug treatment and anti- violence programs (for violent, sexual and drug o\ufb00enders), and speci\ufb01c employment, education and training programs. For example, on 2 February 2016, the Aboriginal Art Policy Model was launched. It allows Australian Indigenous prisoners to sell their artwork through the prison art program.\nAn example of a case in which the judge decided the accused had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation \nis DPP v England on the next page.sanction \na penalty (e.g. a fine or prison sentence) imposed by a court on a person guilty of a criminal offence\nrehabilitation \none purpose of a sanction; a strategy designed to reform an offender in order to prevent them from committing offences in the future\npunishment \none purpose of a sanction; a strategy designed to penalise (i.e. punish) the offender and show society and the victim that criminal behaviour will not be tolerated\ndeterrence \none purpose of a sanction; a process by which the court can discourage the offender and others in the community from committing similar offences\ndenunciation \none purpose of a sanction; a process by which a court can demonstrate the community\u2019s disapproval of the offender\u2019s actions\nprotection/uni00A0 \none purpose of a sanction; a strategy designed to safeguard the community from an offender in order to prevent them from committing further offence (e.g. by imprisoning them)\ncommunity correction \norder (CCO) a non-custodial sanction (i.e. one that doesn\u2019t involve a prison sentence) that the offender serves in the community, with conditions attached to the order\n04_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   114 6/12/2017   12:47 PM",

She also stole a CD. Two weeks later, England attempted another armed robbery with a co- offender at a gaming venue, but failed after a man threw a computer mouse in the face of her co- offender. Two days later, England and the same co- offender committed an armed robbery at a bank. The robbery failed after a customer grabbed England. England stabbed another customer in the leg with a screwdriver and was eventually restrained.\nEngland pleaded guilty to several charges, including two charges of armed robbery, one \ncharge of attempted armed robbery, one charge of recklessly causing injury and one charge of being in possession of a firearm.\nHer Honour Judge Hampel noted that England had three children, had engaged in illicit \ndrug use and came from a loving and supportive family. Judge Hampel found that England had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation, saying:\nYou are of average intelligence and on the materials before me it would appear, unimpaired \nby mental illness or psychological conditions that would hold you back from rehabilitation. Should you choose to give up drugs and negative peer associations, that is to not to mix with bad people anymore, you should be able to turn yourself in to a useful law- abiding person who can live a meaningful and happy life; to have good relationships with family, good relationships with good friends and good relationships with your children. There is nothing in the material before me to suggest that you are not capable of doing that. So, that counts in your favour in terms of an assessment of your prospects for rehabilitation and should, I/uni00A0hope, make you feel a bit better about yourself rather than defeated.\nEngland was sentenced to seven years in prison. She is to serve a period of four- and- a- half \nyears before being eligible for release on parole. The 211/uni00A0days England had already served in \ndetention was to be counted as part of the sentence already served.LEGAL  \nCASE\nSource 1 Prisoners are offered the opportunity to undertake education and training programs in prison.\n04_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   115 9/10/2017   4:12 PM",
  "Page 128": "116  UNIT 3  RIGHTS AND JUSTICEDeterrence\nSome sanctions are aimed at discouraging other people from committing similar crimes. This is known \nas general deterrence because it is aimed at deterring the entire community from committing similar \no\ufb00  ences (because they see the severe consequences of committing the crime).A grave offence requires a heavy punishment\nR v Banek [2017] VSC 11 (1 February/uni00A02017)\nOn 13 March 2016, Abuk \u2018Jackie\u2019 Akek, 20, was murdered in her Melton home. Her killer was her former de facto partner Makeny \u2018Nelson\u2019 Banek, 24. They had a two- year- old son. The murder was callous and horrific. Banek had decided to kill Akek. He beat her mercilessly, punching and kicking her, and then he choked her, took a knife and stabbed her three times in the abdomen. Akek tried to defend herself, but she died within a very short time of the attack.\nBanek carried Akek\u2019s body to her bed and covered her with a blanket, then covered up his \ninvolvement. He later returned to her home and placed a plastic rose on the bed beside her. Banek\u2019s mother and brother later found Akek. Police arrested Banek later that evening. He confessed immediately and extensively, and he was charged with her murder. He pleaded guilty at an early/uni00A0stage.\nAt his sentencing hearing, Justice Croucher of the Supreme Court/uni00A0said:\nThis is a grave example of murder. A/uni00A0 young mother has been brutally bashed and \nstabbed to death for no reason other than her killer\u2019s judgment that, because she \ndid not want him, she was not entitled to live. It is sickening. General deterrence, \ncurial denunciation and just punishment compel a heavy sentence. The \nmurder occurred against the background of previous instances of violence \nsufficiently serious to result in prison sentences for a first offender. Thus, \nspecific deterrence also looms large as a sentencing purpose.\nIn light of Banek\u2019s full confession, early plea of guilty and other \nconsiderations, Banek was sentenced to 23/uni00A0years\u2019 imprisonment with a \nnon- parole period of 18/uni00A0years.LEGAL\nCASE\nAt his sentencing hearing, Justice Croucher of the Supreme Court/uni00A0said:\nThis is a grave example of murder.

General deterrence, \nSource 2 After the murder Mr Banek \nreturned to Ms Akek\u2019s home and placed a plastic rose on the bed beside her/uni00A0body.Punishment\nPunishment is one of the purposes of sanctions. It gives the community some revenge against the \no\ufb00  ender. When a crime has been committed, an o\ufb00  ender has done something unacceptable to society, especially if someone has been hurt, and must be punished so that the victim of the crime and the community feel justice has been done. O\ufb00  enders should be punished to an extent and in such a manner that is just in all the circumstances so the community can feel it has achieved retribution.\nThis process of punishment through the courts avoids the need for the victim of a crime to take \nthe matter into their own hands and seek revenge. But punishment must be appropriate to the o\ufb00  ence committed.\nMore often than not, the purpose of punishment is combined with another purpose such as \ndeterrence.\nThe heavy punishment handed down in the case below was appropriate because of the nature of \nthe o\ufb00  ence. You must be familiar \nwith each of the five purposes of sanctions because they are listed in the VCE Legal Studies Study Design.Study tipIn 1788, sentencing options in the colony of New South Wales included execution, flogging with a cat of nine tails whip, and confinement in/uni00A0irons.Did you know?\n04_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   116 9/10/2017   4:12 PM",

A/uni00A0particular sanction may be given to show the \ncommunity that the court disapproves of the o\ufb00ender\u2019s conduct. For example, the judge may give a harsher sentence for a particularly violent rape and make comment about how the court is showing disapproval of this type of behaviour. This is demonstrated in the case of DPP v Granata [2016] VSCA 190 on the next page.General deterrence for tax evasion/uni00A0case\nDPP v Keefer [2016] VCC 1805 (25 November/uni00A02016)\nDaniel Keefer operated a business in Maidstone, Victoria. He ran into financial difficulties and decided to allow his premises and businesses to be used to assist in the importation of a container of goods that concealed a large amount of tobacco. Concealment of the tobacco would avoid taxes being imposed. The container was said to contain \u2018600 cartons of toilets\u2019 and was to be delivered to Keefer\u2019s business. Keefer would be provided with a certain sum of money to help with the importation on behalf of someone/uni00A0else.\nOn 19 August 2013, the container arrived in Australia, was examined, and 17 009/uni00A0 kg of \ntobacco was found. Customs decided to proceed with a controlled delivery, which meant they removed the tobacco, replaced it with ballast, and delivered the container. In December 2014, Keefer was charged under the Customs Act with importing goods (tobacco products) with an \nintent to defraud the revenue. At his committal hearing Keefer pleaded not guilty and the matter proceeded to trial. Keefer ultimately entered a plea of guilty.\nAfter considering Keefer\u2019s circumstances, Her Honour Judge Gaynor noted that his \nprospects of rehabilitation were excellent, and she doubted that the courts would ever see him again. She/uni00A0said:\nAs I/uni00A0 doubt that a court will ever see you again, I/uni00A0 do not regard the aspects of specific \ndeterrence, punishment or protection of the community to be relevant to the sentencing exercise before me. But the issue of general deterrence, that is, the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment which is designed to deter other people minded to behave in the criminal fashion that you did, is a very live issue in this sentencing exercise. That is, ordinarily I/uni00A0would be expected to impose a sentence upon you which would effectively frighten and deter other persons from behaving in the way you/uni00A0have.\nHer Honour decided that the general deterrence purpose could be best achieved by the \nimposition of a term of 18/uni00A0months\u2019 imprisonment. However, Her Honour immediately released \nKeefer from prison upon Keefer agreeing to be of good behaviour for two years. If he were not of good behaviour, he would be resentenced.LEGAL  \nCASE\nDesigner note: I tried keep all legal case boxes together on \nthe same page. /T_here are some empty spaces le/f_t, see if we can have more text to be inserted.

Sometimes it is necessary to remove an o\ufb00ender \nfrom the community (put them in prison) to achieve this aim, because the o\ufb00ender is physically prevented from reo\ufb00ending.\nA non- cust odial sentence (when an o\ufb00ender isn\u2019t put in prison), \nsuch as a CCO, can also protect the community from o\ufb00enders because they keep o\ufb00enders busy when they might otherwise be engaged in criminal activity. However, o\ufb00enders sometimes abuse CCOs and o\ufb00end while carrying out community/uni00A0work.\nUnder section 6D of the Sentencing Act, a court can give a \nserious o\ufb00ender a longer sentence that is more appropriate to the gravity of the o\ufb00ence. A/uni00A0serious o\ufb00ender is an arsonist or a drug, sexual or violent o\ufb00ender who has previously been convicted of a similar o\ufb00ence and has served time in prison.

Over a period of six weeks, Granata \nkept the victim confined to a hotel room, repeatedly assaulted and raped her, and stole her personal belongings. A/uni00A0medical examination showed that the victim had more than 50 injuries.\nIn January 2015, Granata pleaded guilty to various charges, including nine charges \nof rape. Judge Gucciardo in the County Court sentenced him on 25 May 2015 to 17/uni00A0years\u2019 imprisonment, with a non- parole period of 13/uni00A0years. The DPP appealed against the sentence on three grounds, one of which was that the sentence of imprisonment for the rape offences was manifestly inadequate.\nThe Court of Appeal found that there was a need \nto impose an appropriate punishment, express unequivocally the Court\u2019s denunciation of the offending, and impose a sentence that reflected the need for general and specific deterrence.

You must learn these three sanctions and their purposes, as well as the ability of these sanctions to achieve their purposes. It is possible that you will be asked to demonstrate your understanding of these sanctions in your assessment/uni00A0tasks.Study tip\nCrimes Act/uni00A01958 (Vic)\n317A Bomb/uni00A0hoaxes\n(1) A person must/uni00A0not/uni00A0\u2014 \n(a) place an article or substance in any place;/uni00A0or\n(b) send an article or substance by any means of transportation/uni00A0\u2013  \nwith the intention of inducing in another person a false belief that the article or substance is \nlikely to explode or ignite or discharge a dangerous or deleterious matter.  Penalty:/uni00A0Level 6 imprisonment (5/uni00A0years maximum) or a level 6 fine (600 penalty units maximum) or/uni00A0both.EXTRACT\nThe Sentencing Act expresses \ufb01nes in levels (1\u2013 12). Level 2 is the highest level, and level 12 is the lowest \nlevel. Each level refers to a number of penalty units. Level 2 attracts a \ufb01ne of 3 000 penalty units, whereas \nlevel 12 attracts a \ufb01ne of 1 penalty unit. The court cannot order a \ufb01ne at level 1 (very serious o\ufb00ences \nsuch as murder).\nThe use of \u2018penalty units\u2019 instead of \ufb01xed monetary \ufb01nes allows the government to increase all \ufb01nes \nby increasing the value of a penalty unit each year without changing all statutes. Using the example for a bomb hoax o\ufb00ence, setting the \ufb01ne to a maximum of 600 penalty units will mean that the maximum \ufb01ne that can be imposed will increase annually, because the value of penalty units will increase.\nUnder the Sentencing Act, when \ufb01xing a \ufb01ne a court must consider the \ufb01nancial circumstances of the \no\ufb00ender and the nature of the burden that payment will impose. The court may also consider any loss or destruction of, or damage to, property su\ufb00ered by a person as a result of the o\ufb00ence and the value of any bene\ufb01t to the o\ufb00ender as a result of the o\ufb00ence.\nIf a \ufb01ne is not paid, the o\ufb00ender can be imprisoned or ordered to undertake community/uni00A0work.\nThe case below is an example of the court imposing a \ufb01ne as a general deterrence against employers \nfailing to address safety risks.A fine is not paid to \nthe victim of a crime. Instead, it is paid to the state of Victoria. However, a court can make a restitution order or compensation order which may involve a payment to the victim.Did you know?\nCompany found guilty and/uni00A0fined \nDPP v Bilic Homes Pty Ltd [2016] VCC 810 (14 June/uni00A02016)\nIn March 2014, Bilic Homes, a registered company, was engaged to build two units on a site in \nBrighton East.

Bilic Homes entered \nan early plea of guilty.\nThe Court accepted that general deterrence was an \nimportant sentencing consideration. In sentencing, the judge referred to a previous judgment which noted that sentences in such cases draw attention to the importance of workplace safety, and there was a need to send a message to employers that failure to address safety risks will attract significant punishment. The company was convicted and fined $300 000.LEGAL  \nCASE\nSource 2 In 2014,/uni00A0a brick wall in Brighton East \ncollapsed during strong winds, killing Michael Klanja. \n04_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   121 9/10/2017   4:12 PM",
  "Page 134": "122  UNIT  3 RIGHT S AND JUSTICESentencing purposes of/uni00A0fines\nFines serve  to punish o\ufb00enders by  requiring them to  pay money to  the state.  Therefore the \ncircumstances of each o\ufb00ender are  important when a magistrate or judge is deciding on an \nappropriate sanction. The  \ufb01nancial circumstances of  the o\ufb00ender are  important because the \namount of the \ufb01ne needs to  be high enough to  act as a punishment. \nFines can act as a speci\ufb01c deterrence to  discourage an o\ufb00ender from reo\ufb00ending, but they \ncan also act as a general deterrence to  other members of the public who know they will have  \nto pay a \ufb01ne if they are  caught committing a similar act.\nFinally, \ufb01nes can also act as a form  of denunciation (i.e. a clear public declaration that \ncertain acts and behaviours are  unacceptable). A court may  give  a very  high \ufb01ne to  a person or \norganisation as a way  of denouncing certain actions and showing strong disapproval.  \nThe ability of/uni00A0fines to/uni00A0achieve their purposes\nNo single sanction will be able to  achieve the purposes of all sanctions. Some factors to  consider when \ndetermining whether a \ufb01ne can achieve its purposes include:\n\u2022 the wealth of the o\ufb00ender \u2013 For  example, if the o\ufb00ender has signi\ufb01cant wealth, then the \ufb01ne may  not \npunish them or act as a speci\ufb01c deterrent\n\u2022 the ability to  denounce the crime \u2013 For  example, a level 2 \ufb01ne (the highest level) is just over  $460 \n000, which may  not send a strong enough message to  some of the community about the court\u2019s \ndisapproval\n\u2022 whether a \ufb01ne is su\ufb03cient to  act as a general deterrent for  the whole community \u2013 For  example, a \ufb01ne \nthat is too  small may  only deter people without much/uni00A0money\n\u2022 whether there is a more appropriate sanction \u2013 For  example, a sanction that protects the community \nor rehabilitates the o\ufb00ender might be more useful to  the community.\nThese are  not the only factors you  could take  into account when determining if a \ufb01ne is able to  achieve \nits purposes.

The Youth Control Order operates similarly to a CCO.Did you know?A community correction order (CCO) is a supervised sentence served in the community that includes \nspecial conditions, such as treatment of the o\ufb00ender and unpaid community work for a number of hours. A/uni00A0CCO is a non- custodial sentence. It can be used as a sanction for a range of o\ufb00ences. \nCCOs give o\ufb00enders the opportunity to stop their criminal behaviour and undergo treatment or take part \nin educational, vocational or personal development programs. This is known as \u2018tailor- made\u2019 sentencing.\nA court can only impose a CCO if the o\ufb00ender has been convicted or found guilty of an o\ufb00ence \npunishable by more than 5 penalty units, the court has received a pre-sentence report, and the o\ufb00ender consents to the order.\nThe court must also be satis\ufb01ed that the CCO is appropriate for the particular o\ufb00ender. If the \no\ufb00ender doesn\u2019t comply with the order, it can be cancelled, and the o\ufb00ender will be resentenced for the original o\ufb00ence. This could mean a tougher sentence because the o\ufb00ender has failed to comply with the/uni00A0CCO.\nA CCO can be imposed for up to two years in the Magistrates\u2019 Court for a single o\ufb00ence, and no more \nthan \ufb01ve years in any of the Victorian courts.\nA CCO can be combined with a \ufb01ne or up to one year in prison. When combined with a prison \nsentence, the CCO will commence on the o\ufb00ender\u2019s release from/uni00A0jail.\nIn 2016, Victorian legislation was passed to restrict the use of/uni00A0CCOs for o\ufb00ences committed after \nMarch 2017:\n\u2022 a CCO cannot be a sanction for \u2018category 1 o\ufb00ences\u2019 . Category 1 o\ufb00ences include murder, causing \nserious injury intentionally or recklessly, rape, incest and some drug o\ufb00ences\n\u2022 a CCO cannot be a sanction for \u2018category 2 o\ufb00ences\u2019 unless in certain circumstances (e.g. where the o\ufb00ender is over the age of 18, but under 21 at the time of the o\ufb00ence, or where the o\ufb00ender has a mental impairment). Category 2 o\ufb00ences include manslaughter, child homicide, kidnapping, arson causing death and some drug o\ufb00ences. \nSource 1 Unpaid community work is one of the conditions \nthat may be imposed as part of/uni00A0a Community Correction Order (CCO).\nFederation of Australia the union of separate colonies that gave up some of their powers to a central authority to form the Commonwealth of AustraliaIn 2017, the Sentencing Advisory Council released \u2018A Quick Guide to Sentencing\u2019 on its website.

Conditions such as requiring the person to  \nreceive visits from a community corrections o\ufb03cer, obtaining permission before leaving Victoria and \ncomplying with directions by  community corrections o\ufb03cers can be a limitation on the freedom of the \no\ufb00ender.\nConditions such as an alcohol exclusion and treatment and rehabilitation aim to  rehabilitate the \no\ufb00ender by  treating the underlying causes of the o\ufb00ending.\nThe \ufb01ndings of a South Australian study suggest that positive self- ima ge is the most important factor \nin predicting lower recidivism. This was  relevant to  the o\ufb00ender\u2019s perception of the sanction and the \nsetting in which it was  imposed. CCOs, supported by  programs designed to  assist the o\ufb00ender, emphasise \nthe \u2018good citizen\u2019 aspects of the sanction and help the o\ufb00ender\u2019s self- ima ge. In contrast, a custodial \nsanction (e.g. imprisonment) tends to  emphasise fear and remorse.\nA CCO can also act as a speci\ufb01c deterrence. Having to  do unpaid community work  and comply with \nburdensome conditions may  discourage the o\ufb00ender from committing the same crime/uni00A0again.\nThe ability of/uni00A0CCOs to/uni00A0achieve their purposes\nSome factors to  consider when determining whether a CCO is able to  achieve its purposes include:\n\u2022 whether there is a condition that will achieve the right purpose for  the particular type of o\ufb00ending\n\u2022 the most appropriate condition to  be imposed, and  whether the court imposes that condition\n\u2022 whether the o\ufb00ender will comply with the conditions\n\u2022 whether a CCO properly protects the community where protection is a relevant purpose\u2022 whether there is another or better sanction that will achieve the necessary purposes.\nAs with \ufb01nes, these are  not the only factors you  should take  into account when considering whether a \nCCO is able to  achieve its purposes.

A/uni00A0concurrent sentence runs at the \nsame time as another sentence. For example, someone who has been found guilty of theft and assault and sentenced to six months for theft and two years for assault \u2018to be served concurrently\u2019 will be in prison for only two years because the two sentences are served at the same time. Sentences are usually ordered to be served concurrently.\nA cumulative sentence is served straight after another sentence. In the above example, the o\ufb00ender \nwould serve two years and six months. A/uni00A0cumulative sentence must be/uni00A0given:\n\u2022 for certain serious o\ufb00enders (as de\ufb01ned, and which includes o\ufb00enders who commit arson, and certain \ndrug, sexual and serious violent o\ufb00ences)\n\u2022 where the imprisonment is in default of payment of a \ufb01ne or sum of/uni00A0money\u2022 for an o\ufb00ence by a prisoner or an escape o\ufb00ence\u2022 for an o\ufb00ence committed by a person released on parole or on/uni00A0bail.\nAggregate sentences\nIf an o\ufb00ender has been convicted of multiple, related o\ufb00ences, the court has the option of imposing \nan aggregate sentence that applies to more than one o\ufb00ence, rather than separate sentences for \neach o\ufb00ence. For example, a judge may hand down a sentence of three years in prison for all of the o\ufb00ences, and may not specify how much of that sentence is with respect to each individual o\ufb00ence. This enables the court to impose a sentence that re\ufb02ects all of the o\ufb00ender\u2019s conduct, and provides a clearer explanation of the total sentence. Aggregate sentences are not available for serious o\ufb00ences where there is a presumption that sentences will be served cumulatively.\nAn aggregate sentence cannot exceed the total e\ufb00ective sentence that would have been imposed if a \nseparate sentence were imposed for each o\ufb00ence.\nIndefinite sentences\nIf a person (other than a young person) is convicted by the Supreme Court or the County Court of a serious o\ufb00ence, the court may sentence them to an inde\ufb01nite term of imprisonment. Serious o\ufb00ences include murder, manslaughter, child homicide, threats to kill, rape, kidnapping, armed robbery and sexual o\ufb00ences with children under/uni00A016.\n04_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   127 9/10/2017   4:13 PM",

He also pleaded guilty to five summary charges, including three charges of driving while disqualified.\nHer Honour Judge Campton sentenced Smith to three years and eight months in prison, \nwith a non- parole period of two years. He had already served 155/uni00A0days in prison, which was taken off his sentence. His licence was also cancelled for a period of 12/uni00A0months. In sentencing Smith, her Honour stated the following in relation to mitigating factors:\nThe offences were committed during a period of your life when you were suffering \nconsiderable personal strain and had recommenced using drugs in the context of the still \nbirth of your daughter, Phoebe, in December 2012. You had pleaded guilty and expressed remorse for your offences. You suffered from autism spectrum and the court should take into account the principles in R v Verdins.\nYou are still a relatively young man and have some prospects of rehabilitation. You \ncontinue to enjoy the support of your partner, Tess Edwards, and she was a positive influence on you. The birth of your son was submitted to have been a stabilising influence on you and to have given you motivation to rehabilitate.\nCounsel also relied on the short period when you were on bail where you demonstrated \nsome ability to lead a positive lifestyle. She referred to the courses that you had completed while you were in prison, in addition to the terms of imprisonment that you had served in Queensland and then in Victoria which were of a recent/uni00A0time.\nIn a letter to the court, your partner, Tess Edwards, urged the court take into account \nthat you are making a real effort to complete courses while in custody to help with your prospects of rehabilitation. She also mentioned that you were engaging with the psychologist at Fulham Correctional Centre who helped you organise ongoing help and treatment.\nWith respect to the charge of arson, your counsel urged the court to take into account \nthat it was unsophisticated and involved little planning. It involved an uncompleted house in an unoccupied housing estate and, therefore, did not pose a risk to the safety of any people. It was submitted that it was not motivated by revenge, malice or anger, which were aggravating features frequently seen in cases of/uni00A0arson.LEGAL  \nCASE\nGuilty/uni00A0pleas\nOne of the factors a court must take into account when sentencing an o\ufb00ender is whether the o\ufb00ender \npleaded guilty to the o\ufb00ence and, if so, how far into the case. A/uni00A0guilty plea at an early stage before trial (or hearing) or at the start of the trial can result in a less- severe sentence.\nThe Sentencing Act allows the court to take into account a guilty plea when sentencing an o\ufb00ender \nfor a number of reasons. First, if the o\ufb00ender knows that an early guilty plea is taken into account in sentencing, it may encourage them to plead guilty rather than going to trial. Second, an early guilty plea can have signi\ufb01cant bene\ufb01ts to the criminal justice system, including the prosecution, the victims, society, the accused and his or her families, by avoiding the time, expense and stress of a trial. Criminal trials can As shown in the case below, a judge can take into account a number of di\ufb00erent mitigating factors \nwhen sentencing an accused.\n04_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   132 9/10/2017   4:13 PM",

They can also be signi\ufb01cant for a victim of a criminal case who needs legal assistance and advice.\nIn this topic you will explore the way the following costs factors a\ufb00ect the criminal justice system:\n\u2022 costs of legal representation\n\u2022 availability of legal/uni00A0aid\u2022 assistance given to self- represented parties.\nThe \ufb01rst two factors restrict the criminal justice system\u2019s ability to achieve justice, while the third factor \nto some extent enhances/uni00A0it.\nThe costs of/uni00A0legal representation\nThe main costs a person is likely to incur in a criminal \ncase are the costs of engaging a lawyer to provide legal services such as legal advice or representation. The greatest impact tends to be on the accused, who is likely to need legal representation to navigate the criminal justice system. Victims can also be impacted, as they may require legal assistance to assert their rights, make contact with investigative and prosecution agencies and understand procedures such as giving evidence.\nWhile everyone has the right to legal representation, not \neveryone can a\ufb00ord it. This can be particularly damaging for an accused person, because our criminal trial system relies on the parties presenting their own case before the decider of facts (the judge, magistrate or jury). The Law Council of Australia has previously stated that access to legal advice is essential to upholding the rule of/uni00A0law:\nAccess to adequate legal advice is an internationally \nrecognised human right and a fundamental pillar of the \nrule of law. It is something that the Law Council considers should be available to everyone, particularly those people who face criminal charges or other potential restrictions on their liberty.Chapters/uni00A03 and 4 \nexplored various ways that the criminal justice system can be expensive.

They \nmight also be able to obtain pro bono legal representation from a private legal practitioner or pro bono institution. However, those who cannot get assistance through these institutions will have to represent themselves.\nEvery accused person has the right to a fair hearing. This right is now enshrined in the Charter of \nHuman Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic) (Human Rights Charter), and has been recognised by a number of courts, including the High Court in Dietrich v The Queen (1992) 177 CLR/uni00A0292.\nThe courts have recognised in the past that for a person to receive a fair trial, legal representation may \nbe necessary. Most recently, the Supreme Court of Victoria in Matsoukatidou v Yarra Ranges Council [2017] VSC 61 (28 February 2017)/uni00A0recognised the right to a fair trial and that the lack of legal representation can inhibit a fair/uni00A0trial.

Both the mother and daughter were self- represented at the hearing in the Magistrates\u2019 Court. They were ultimately fined. When they appealed to the County Court, the appeals were struck out because they did not appear. They sought an application to reinstate the appeals, and again they were self- represented at the hearings.

They struggled to explain themselves to the judge and were given limited assistance. They did not fully understand what was going on at the hearing. They sought a review of the decision in the Supreme Court, arguing that they did not get a fair hearing, and their rights to equality were not ensured.\nIn the Supreme Court, Justice Bell found in favour of the mother and daughter, and made \norders that their appeal be reinstated and heard by a different judge. The judgment is an important and useful summary of the rights to a fair hearing and to equality before the law. LEGAL  \nCASE\n05_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   141 9/10/2017   5:22 PM",
  "Page 154": "142  UNIT 3  RIGHTS AND JUSTICEThe principles of/uni00A0justice\nThe cost of legal representation can a\ufb00ect the principles of justice. A/uni00A0summary is set out in Source/uni00A03.Justice Bell in particular stated the following in relation to a fair hearing and the ability to \nachieve one without legal representation:\nParticipation by self- represented parties in criminal or civil legal proceedings, including \nbut not only where the other party is represented, gives rise to human rights challenges. \nTheir lack of legal representation creates serious risk of unfairness by reason of ineffective participation in the proceeding or participatory inequality between the parties. This risk arises because self- represented parties lack the professional skill and ability and objectivity usually necessary for effective participation in legal proceedings and adequately to respond to other parties who are represented.\nPRINCIPLE COST OF LEGAL REPRESENTATION\nFairness If an accused person can\u2019t properly participate in a hearing, it may lead to an \nunfair result. In particular, the following can have an impact:/uni00A0\n\u2022 lack of familiarity with the language of criminal/uni00A0trials\u2022 lack of objectivity and emotional distance from what is happening in the/uni00A0case\u2022 lack of knowledge of courtroom facilities\u2022 lack of understanding of procedure.\nEquality If parties can\u2019t afford representation, they are at risk of not being treated \nas equal before the law. For example, they might come up against skilled and experienced prosecutors who understand the law and its procedures, formalities and language. This places an unrepresented accused at risk of not being able to perform at the same level as their opponent. \nAccess An accused who cannot pay for legal representation may have trouble accessing the courts and mechanisms that are used to determine the criminal charges. This may result in an accused person having to plead guilty to a crime they may not have committed because they do not have the means or ability to defend the case.\nSource 3  The cost of legal representation and the principles of justice\nThe availability of/uni00A0legal/uni00A0aid\nWhen VLA was \ufb01rst established, its aim was to repair an unjust system that provided greater opportunities \nto those who could a\ufb00ord legal services. But due to a lack of funding, a large part of the community is not eligible for legal aid, and CLCs are stretched in their ability to o\ufb00er legal aid to people a\ufb00ected by crime. \nAs a result, these people can be denied access to legal services. The extract on the next page is from \na campaign called Legal Aid Matters which provides some indication of the number of people eligible for legal/uni00A0aid.The tables in this \nchapter provide you with some points you can make when evaluating the criminal justice system. Remember, however, that your answers to assessment tasks will need to be more fulsome to get full marks. Study/uni00A0tip\n05_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   142 9/10/2017   5:22 PM",
  "Page 155": "143  CHAPTER  5 REFORMING THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE/uni00A0SYSTEMA lack of funding for legal aid has been a problem for decades. Even though a 2014 Productivity \nCommission report recommended that an extra $200/uni00A0million a year be given to legal assistance \nservices, this amount has not yet been/uni00A0met.\nThe lack of adequate funding for legal aid agencies such as VLA and CLCs \ncan result in those agencies tightening their criteria as to who is eligible for legal aid. This leaves many accused persons in a vulnerable position because they can\u2019t pay for a lawyer and won\u2019t receive legal aid. In 2014\u2013 15, CLCs in Australia turned away more than 159 220 people \nbecause they did not have the resources to help them. This is likely to impact vulnerable and disadvantaged people who rely on legal aid for help, such as those with a disability and those who are homeless. Legal aid is currently available to less than 8 per cent of Australia\u2019s population.\nSome of the most vulnerable people who are disadvantaged \nby a lack of funding and availability of legal aid services are domestic violence victims and their children. These victims often reach out to legal aid services, and if they are turned away it means they are left in unsafe situations, or risk being put into \ufb01nancial di\ufb03culty by having to borrow money to be able to help them through the criminal justice system. Rosie Batty, the 2015 Australian of the Y ear and family violence campaigner who lost her son in 2014 after he was murdered by his father, has spoken publicly about the need for adequate funding for these people. \nSource 4 Rosie Batty, the 2015 Australian of the \nYear, wrote to the prime minister about proposed \nfunding cuts. She was delighted when the cuts were reversed in the May 2017 federal budget.So if you can't afford a lawyer you can access legal/uni00A0aid?\nIn short, probably/uni00A0not.\nEvery year, one in four Australians will experience a legal problem substantial enough \nto require a lawyer.\nIn 2014, 2.5/uni00A0million Australians were living below the poverty line. At current funding \nlevels, however, many people living below the poverty line cannot access legal aid. Fewer \nthan 74 000 legal aid grants were offered in/uni00A02014.\nSo that's 25 per cent of the population with serious legal problems. 10 per cent living \nbelow the poverty line. 0.3 per cent granted legal/uni00A0aid.\nIt's not just the restrictive means tests:/uni00A0 because of the legal aid funding crisis \nperpetuated by the Federal Government's funding model, legal aid just isn't available for many types of legal problems.\nSource: Law Council of Australia, So if you can\u2019t afford a lawyer you can access legal aid?

A/uni00A0summary is set out in Source 5 .\nAssistance to/uni00A0self- represented parties\nThe criminal and civil justice systems are seeing growing numbers of self- represented parties. Some \nchoose to self- r epresent, while others have no choice \u2013  that is, they cannot a\ufb00ord a lawyer, and they are \nnot eligible for legal/uni00A0aid.\nAccording to the Victorian Access to Justice Review Report, the Chief Magistrate of the Magistrates\u2019 \nCourt estimates that up to 50 per cent of all accused persons in criminal matters are now self- represented.\nThis can create challenges for the courts and for the parties, because a self- r epresented party often \n\ufb01nds law unfamiliar and lacks understanding of the law and its formalities, procedure, evidence and \nlanguage.\nAs a result of the rise in self- r epresented parties, courts and judges have to adapt by changing their \nprocesses. Court personnel, judges and magistrates can provide assistance to self- r epresented accused \npersons in a criminal trial, which may enhance their ability to achieve justice.PRINCIPLE AVAILABILITY OF LEGAL AID\nFairness \u2022 Legal aid can assist a person to understand the criminal justice system, \nobtain legal advice and legal representation. This helps to ensure an accused \nreceives a fair trial or hearing, as they are assisted with presenting the case before the judge, jury or magistrate.\n\u2022 Limits on access to free legal services can impact an accused\u2019s ability to \npresent their case in the best possible light and receive a fair hearing. Lack of legal aid may result in people having to represent themselves.\n\u2022 The lack of legal aid can also impact on victims and their families who want \nto assert their rights in the criminal justice system, understand criminal processes and need information about matters such as giving evidence. This can particularly hurt the most vulnerable such as domestic violence victims, Indigenous and Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander people and people with mental health issues. \nEquality \u2022 Legal aid aims to ensure that an accused is not disadvantaged because of \ntheir lack of legal representation.\n\u2022 An accused who is not eligible for legal aid is at risk of not being treated the \nsame as the prosecution. It is usually the most vulnerable in our society who need legal aid, and therefore the ones most likely to be denied legal/uni00A0aid.\n\u2022 A victim or their families who cannot afford legal representation may also be \nat a disadvantage by not being able to assert or understand their legal rights at the same level as someone who has private representation. \nAccess \u2022 Victoria Legal Aid (VLA) and community legal centres (CLCs) aim to ensure \nthat there is access to justice.\n\u2022 A party who can\u2019t get any form of legal aid through these institutions is at \nrisk of not being able to access information, legal help, advice, assistance or representation, and may not be able to understand the processes involved.\nSource 5 The availability of legal aid and the principles of justice\nself- represented/uni00A0party \na person with a matter before a court or tribunal who has not engaged (and is not represented by) a lawyer or other professional\n05_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   144 9/10/2017   5:22 PM",

This was  an unusual step, \nas the Supreme Court\u2019s involvement in CASE\nSTUDY5.2 TIME FACTORS\nAs examined in Chapter/uni00A03, an accused has a right under the Victorian Human Rights Charter to  be \ntried without unreasonable delay. Where possible, delays should be avoided and parties should work  with \npractical speed to  ensure an accused is tried within a reasonable time. What  is considered a reasonable \ntime will, however, depend on the/uni00A0case.\nThe motto \u2018justice delayed is justice denied\u2019 is just as relevant today as it was  when the idea was  \nexpressed in the Magna Carta in 1215 (in which it is stated \u2018to  no one will we  sell, to  no one will we  \nrefuse or delay, right or justice\u2019). Delays in having a trial heard and determined can a\ufb00ect the ability of  \nthe criminal justice system to  achieve justice. In this topic you  will explore the following four time factors:\n\u2022 the delays in preparing a case for/uni00A0trial\n\u2022 court/uni00A0delays\u2022 the use of plea negotiations and sentence indications\u2022 appeals in the Court of Appeal.The \ufb01rst two  factors listed restrict the ability of the criminal justice system to  achieve justice, while the \nthird and fourth factors enhance the ability of the criminal justice system to  achieve justice.\nDelays in/uni00A0preparing a case for/uni00A0hearing or/uni00A0trial\nMost criminal cases involve  a range of tasks such as gathering evidence, locating and interviewing \nwitnesses, determining what happened, and determining what charges should be laid against an accused. \nHow  long these tasks take  to complete will be di\ufb00erent from case to/uni00A0case.\nThe more complicated the case is,  the greater the resources that the O\ufb03ce of Public Prosecutions \n(OPP) needs to  invest in preparing the matter for  trial. The  2015\u2013 16 annual report of the Director of  \nPublic Prosecutions (DPP) and the OPP stated that the average  time taken to  complete criminal matters \nwas 19.2/uni00A0months.\nAn example of delays in a criminal case can be seen in the charges laid against Dimitrious Gargasoulas \nin relation to  the Bourke Street incident that occurred in January/uni00A02017.\nSource 1 A complex criminal case is difficult to  bring \nto court without delay.

  "Page 161": "149  CHAPTER  5 REFORMING THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE/uni00A0SYSTEMPRINCIPLE DELAYS IN PREPARING A CASE FOR TRIAL\nFairness \u2022 Delays in criminal cases can result in emotional strain for the accused and his or \nher family, the stigma of being charged with a crime, the possible loss of a job, and \ndisruption of family life. The impact on the victim and his or her family can be just as significant \u2013  victims have to wait for the case to be heard, and may not be able to move on until it is over.\n\u2022 If the accused is being held on remand, there are the physical and mental effects of \nspending time in prison, and it may be difficult to prepare a case adequately. Delays could also mean that witnesses may be unavailable, or their memories may become cloudy. This can reduce the likelihood of a fair outcome.\nEquality \u2022 Delays can impact on those who are most vulnerable, putting them at risk of not being treated equally before the law. For example, delays can be particularly distressing for people with a mental illness or disability, those who are aged, or victims who have suffered significant trauma. Delays can therefore place someone in a more disadvantageous position than they otherwise would have been.\nAccess \u2022 The greater the wait in having a case heard and determined, the less the courts become \naccessible to the parties. The negative impact of delays can be particularly difficult for victims of trauma or sexual offences.\n\u2022 On the other hand, a timely and speedy determination of a criminal case can ensure \nthat the courts remain accessible to people, and people have confidence in the criminal justice system.Many, however, see the delays in preparing a case for trial to be a result of the nature of our \njustice system, which relies on the prosecution gathering evidence, an over- r eliance on hard copy \ndocuments, and the need for committal proceedings in what may be seen to be straightforward \ncases. \nIn May 2017, the family of murdered mother Kylie Blackwood expressed dismay at the fact that they \nwould have to wait an additional seven months for her alleged murderer to face a committal proceeding. Scott Murdoch, the accused, was granted additional time to gather evidence. His legal representatives agreed that the delay was unacceptable, but it was due in part to the fact that Murdoch had changed legal representatives three times. These delays can be particularly frustrating to a victim, a victim\u2019s family, and society, who all have an interest in the outcome of a case./uni00A0/uni00A0 \nThe principles of/uni00A0justice\nDelays in preparing a case for trial can a\ufb00ect the principles of justice.

A/uni00A0summary is set out in Source 5.\nPlea negotiations and sentence indications\nThe use of plea negotiations and sentence indications have helped signi\ufb01cantly in addressing the delays \nfaced by the courts and the prosecution in criminal matters.\nPlea negotiations can reduce delays by achieving an early guilty plea in a case. This ensures a quicker \ndetermination of the case and allows resources to be used elsewhere. Sentence indications can also reduce delays by providing an accused with an opportunity to plead guilty once they know what sentence is likely to be imposed.\nIn their 2015\u2013 16 annual report, the DPP and OPP stated that guilty pleas were achieved in 77 per/uni00A0cent \nof matters (see the extract below).guilty plea \nwhen an offender officially admits guilt which is then considered by the court when sentencing\nEarly resolution\nThe resolution of matters through guilty pleas contributes to effective, economic and \nefficient prosecutions. OPP solicitors assess each matter as early as possible for a potential guilty plea to appropriate charges \u2013  that reflect the accused\u2019s criminality, based on what can be proved beyond reasonable doubt, and that allows for a sentence that adequately reflects the criminality \u2026\nAs well as achieving fair and just outcomes in an efficient way, guilty pleas relieve \nvictims and witnesses of the burden of giving evidence before a trial, and provide certainty of outcome. In 2015/ 16, 77 per cent of prosecutions were finalised as a guilty plea \u2013  the \nhighest level recorded at the OPP since comparable records began 20/uni00A0years ago.

The accused does not have to accept any negotiation or sentence indication. He or she has an opportunity to decide whether to plead guilty.\n\u2022 Plea negotiations are intended to ensure that the charges reflect \nthe accused\u2019s criminality, ensuring that there is fairness in what is being negotiated. Similarly, sentence indications are based on the information available to the judge or magistrate.\n\u2022 Plea negotiations and sentence indications avoid the burden of \ntrial for victims and witnesses.\n\u2022 Victims and members of society may see both of these methods \nas unfair in that the accused is seen as being \u2018let off\u2019.\nEquality \u2022 Plea negotiations and sentence indications are generally \navailable to all accused persons, therefore everyone has an equal opportunity to negotiate with the prosecution or seek a sentence indication.\n\u2022 Victims may feel they are themselves disadvantaged because \nan accused does not have to face trial (though equally they may avoid the trauma and stress involved in a trial).\nAccess \u2022 Guilty pleas avoid the trauma, stress and inconvenience of \ntrial, which enables better access to parties and victims to the criminal justice system.\n\u2022 In plea negotiations, victims are often consulted about their \nviews, ensuring the prosecution considers their views when negotiating charges. The victim\u2019s views, however, do not determine plea negotiations.\nSource 6 The use of plea negotiations and sentence indications and the principles of justice\n05_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   152 9/10/2017   5:23 PM",

But this is not always the case, particularly for di\ufb00erent cultural groups in society. These include people for whom English is not their \ufb01rst language and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.\nCulturally- bas ed di\ufb03culties include lack of knowledge of the legal system, lack of understanding of \nEnglish, legal system failures to account for di\ufb00erences, and cultural misunderstandings.\nIn this topic you will explore the following four factors relating to cultural di\ufb00erences:\n\u2022 di\ufb03culties faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in questioning and giving evidence\n\u2022 the o ver- representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the criminal justice/uni00A0system\n\u2022 the use of the Koori Court in sentencing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples\u2022 the use of translators.\nThe \ufb01rst two factors listed inhibit or restrict the ability of the criminal justice system to achieve justice, \nwhereas the third and fourth factors enhance the ability of the criminal justice system to achieve justice.\nProblems during/uni00A0questioning and giving evidence\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have a complex system of law and customs, handed \ndown from generation to generation. Those from traditional areas who are not familiar with contemporary Australian society are likely to experience di\ufb03culties in giving evidence in courts. They may experience problems in clearly understanding the English language, as well as complicated evidence presented in court. These di\ufb03culties are made worse by cultural or language barriers, embarrassment and/uni00A0fear.\nThe following are some of the di\ufb03culties faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples:\n\u2022 langua ge barriers \u2013  There are subtle di\ufb00erences in the way language is used by Indigenous people \nthat can cause misunderstandings. For example, \u2018kill\u2019 may mean to hit someone, probably causing injury, but not necessarily killing them; \u2018story\u2019 in Aboriginal usage usually means the truth, the real account of an event, not something that has been made/uni00A0up.CULTURAL FACTORS\nKoori Court \na division of the Magistrates\u2019 Court, Children\u2019s Court and County Court that (in certain circumstances) operates as a sentencing court for Aboriginal people\nThe VCE Legal Studies Study Design requires you to know factors that affect the ability of the criminal justice system to achieve justice, including in relation to cultural differences.

Her partner had subjected her to physical and sexual torture and was about to rape her/uni00A0niece.\nThe accused did not give or call evidence at trial, which lasted less than a day. She found it \ndifficult to talk to her legal representative and to the police. She was scared, embarrassed and shy. It would have been unlikely for her to reveal sensitive or significant information unless a person communicated with her in the traditional way, which does not involve direct questions. Her sense of family responsibility would have obstructed her ability or willingness to discuss the threats made by her de facto husband, who said he was going to have sex with her niece, which was one of the provoking factors.\nThe jury took 50 minutes to reach a guilty verdict. The defendant appealed to the Queensland \nCourt of Appeal on the basis that she did not receive a fair trial. The Court of Appeal held that there was a miscarriage of justice, noting there were a number of interacting factors which presented difficulties of communication between the woman and her legal representatives.LEGAL  \nCASE\u2022 direct questioning \u2013  The question and answer method of obtaining evidence, which is often the way \nevidence is obtained in criminal matters, can be inappropriate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander witnesses who are not used to this method. In many Indigenous cultures, group agreement through long, sometimes roundabout discussion and telling with stories is the polite way to settle di\ufb00erences, and directness is impolite. The criminal justice system, with its forced yes/ no answers, sets Aboriginal \npeople up to look evasive or dishonest when they are actually being respectful.\n\u2022 body language \u2013  Direct eye contact is seen as disrespectful to some Aboriginal and Torres Strait \nIslander peoples, who try to avoid it by looking down or to the side. This may make them appear uninterested or unreliable to those who do not understand Indigenous customs.\n\u2022 shyness and submissiveness \u2013  Indigenous people answer questions posed by non-Indigenous \npeople in the way in which they think the questioner wants, rather than necessarily what actually happened. Some may also be submissive to authority even to the extent of admitting guilt, without realising the consequences and implications of the admission.\n\u2022 cultur al taboos \u2013   Within some Indigenous cultures it is forbidden to speak of certain things, such \nas the names of dead people, or someone the community holds in disgrace. In some instances it is \nforbidden to mention gender- based knowledge in front of the other gender. These traditional laws can \ncause di\ufb03culties and misunderstandings for Indigenous people who have been charged with an o\ufb00ence.\n\u2022 lack of understanding of court procedures \u2013  Some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples \nmay not understand why they have to tell the same story over and over, such as during examination- \nin- chief and then cross- examination. In an attempt not to o\ufb00end the authorities, they may think they are required to change their story for each telling. This makes it easier for the barrister to make a witness appear inconsistent. A/uni00A0Darwin magistrate has been quoted as saying that Indigenous witnesses give their view of the facts honestly during evidence- in- c hief, but they do badly in cross- examination \nbecause they do not understand its purpose.\nSome of the di\ufb03culties that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples may face in their involvement \nwith the criminal justice system are highlighted in the case below.\n05_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   155 9/10/2017   5:23 PM",

According to  the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Prisoners \nin Australia as at  June 2016, the total Aboriginal and Torres Strait \nIslander population aged  18/uni00A0years and over  was  approximately 2 per \ncent of the Australian population, yet  Aboriginal and Torres Strait \nIslander prisoners accounted for  27 per cent of  the total Australian \nprisoner population.\nThe prisoner population varies across states. In Victoria, 8/uni00A0per cent  \nof the prison population identi\ufb01es as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander,  \nwhereas in the Northern Territory, the rate  was 84 per/uni00A0cent.\nThe over-  representation is not limited to  o\ufb00enders. Research in \n2002 by  Gardiner and Takagaki showed that Indigenous women in \nVictoria are  two to four times more likely to  be the victim of certain \ntypes of crime than non- Indigenous/uni00A0women.\nThe reasons for  the over-  representation have  been the subject  \nof academic debate and research. In October 2016, the Federal \nGovernment announced an Australian Law Reform Commission \n(ALRC) inquiry into the factors leading to  over-  representation in order \nto make recommendations for  reform.

In 1991, Indigenous Australians made up 14 per cent of our nation\u2019s prison population; by 2015, this had increased to 27 per/uni00A0cent.\nOther worrying statistics include the fact that Indigenous children and teenagers are \n24 times more likely to be incarcerated than their non- Indigenous peers, while Indigenous women are 30 times more likely to be incarcerated.\nThe ALRC\u2019s inquiry is a critical step for breaking through these disturbing trends. The \nterms of reference will be subject to consultation, particularly with Indigenous Australians, state and territory governments who have primary responsibility for our criminal justice frameworks, as well as the broader legal profession.\nThe Turnbull Government is committed to reducing Indigenous incarceration and has \ncommitted $256/uni00A0 million in 2016\u201317 through the Indigenous Advancement Strategy for activities to address the drivers and improve community safety.\nSource: Attorney-General\u2019s Department, \u2018ALRC inquiry into incarceration rate of Indigenous Australians\u2019 \n(Media Release, 27 October 2016) <https://www.attorneygeneral.gov.au/Mediareleases/Pages/2016/\nFourthQuarter/ALRC-inquiry-into-incarceration-rate-of-indigenous-australians.aspx>.EXTRACT\nPRINCIPLE OVER/hyphen.case  REPRESENTATION OF ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER PEOPLES\nFairness \u2022 Language and other issues can lead to misunderstandings between Aboriginal and \nTorres Strait Islander peoples and their lawyers and court personnel, resulting in unfair \nprocesses and a possible unfair trial or hearing.\nEquality \u2022 The o ver- representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples demands \ngreater attention by courts and those involved in the justice system to the complexity of their legal needs.

The o\ufb03ce includes seven lawyers and support sta\ufb00 with specialist skills in criminal and family law, including family violence and child protection matters. The o\ufb03ce is intended to serve a signi\ufb01cant population in the Hume region including Shepparton, Cobram, Wangaratta, Wodonga and Myrtleford. A/uni00A0new courthouse has also been designed as the headquarters for the Hume/ Goulburn region for delivery of justice and to reduce court delays, provide more accessible and responsive services for regional Victoria and o\ufb00er a safe, secure environment.\npro bono \na Latin term meaning \u2018for the public good\u2019; a term used to describe legal services that are provided for free (or at a reduced rate)\npractice note \na document issued by a court which guides the operation and management of cases\nunanimous verdict  \na verdict or decision where all the jury members are in agreement and decide the same way (for example they all agree the accused is guilty) \nmajority verdict \na jury verdict where all but one of the members of the jury agree with the decision\u2022 Free online tool \u2013 In 2016 lawyers Doogue O\u2019Brien George, as part of their pro bono work, \nreleased a free online tool called Robot Lawyers, designed to help people who cannot a\ufb00ord a private lawyer and do not qualify for legal aid. It is aimed at \ufb01lling the gap in the legal services industry by helping people who cannot a\ufb00ord a lawyer to represent themselves if required. The online tool has a number of \u2018robots\u2019 \u2013  assault robot, drug robot and theft robot as examples/uni00A0\u2013  which are speci\ufb01cally designed to help accused people face particular charges.\nRecent reforms addressing time factors\n\u2022 Increase in use of court technology \u2013  The County Court and the Supreme Court are increasingly \naiming to become paperless, or increase their use of digital processes to ensure they are more e\ufb03cient in dealing with cases. The County Court re- r eleased its criminal division practice note in \nFebruary 2017, requiring particular documents to be \ufb01led electronically. The County Court is also now recording evidence in a format that allows it to be played if there is a retrial to avoid the cost, time and inconvenience of witnesses having to give evidence/uni00A0again.\n\u2022 \nRemoval of time limit for jury deliberations \u2013  Previously, it was mandatory for jurors to take six \nhours in a criminal trial to get to a unanimous verdict before a majority verdict was accepted. The Juries Act 2000 (Vic) was amended in 2017 so that the mandatory six- hour timeframe (the previous minimum \ntime required to get to a unanimous verdict) was removed and a majority verdict could be accepted earlier. This is intended to help reduce delays and deliver shorter trials. \n05_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   162 9/10/2017   5:23 PM",

This followed the introduction of the hearing of Koori Court matters in Geelong from June 2016, which will be for both Magistrates\u2019 Court and Children\u2019s Court matters.\n\u2022 Funding for Aboriginal prisoners\u2019 programs \u2013  In 2017 the Victorian Government \nannounced grants worth almost $2.5 million to support programs designed to rehabilitate Aboriginal prisoners by focusing on cultural strengthening, tackling family violence, healing, parenting and women\u2019s programs. The aim is to help drive down the over- r epresentation of \nAboriginal people in Victorian prisons.\nRecent reforms addressing other factors\n\u2022 Chang es to bail laws \u2013  The Victorian Parliament in 2016 and 2017 made changes to the Bail Act \n1977 (Vic). The changes mean that persons charged with certain o\ufb00ences, including murder and aggravated home invasion, can only be granted bail in exceptional circumstances. The changes reverse the presumption of bail for people charged with certain o\ufb00ences. \n\u2022 Chang es to jury directions in sexual o\ufb00ence cases \u2013   The Victorian Parliament amended the Jury \nDirections Act 2015 (Vic) in 2017. Judges are now required to direct a jury that victims in sexual o\ufb00ence \ntrials do not remember all the details of a sexual o\ufb00ence, may describe it di\ufb00erently at di\ufb00erent times, and that does not mean that the witness is being untruthful. This is aimed at helping ensure that the jury acts fairly and equally in relation to victims of sexual o\ufb00ences giving evidence. \nThe ability of/uni00A0recent reforms to/uni00A0achieve \nthe/uni00A0principles of/uni00A0justice\nFor each of the recent reforms, you should be able to discuss them in light of their ability to achieve the \nprinciples of justice, and the extent to which they have overcome the factors that a\ufb00ect the achievement of justice.\nTo do so, you should consider the following questions for each recent reform:\n\u2022 What problem, di\ufb03culty or issue is it designed to overcome?\n\u2022 Is it a short- term or long- term solution?\u2022 What principles of justice is the reform achieving?\u2022 Ar e there any statistics, data or evidence to show that the reform has improved the criminal justice \nsystem?\n\u2022 W hat else needs to be done in addition to the reform, or is it a \u2018total solution\u2019 to the problem, di\ufb03culty \nor issue it is trying to overcome?Source 2 The opening of the County Koori Court in Mildura in October 2016\n05_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   163 9/10/2017   5:23 PM",

Some of the recommended reforms are discussed here. For each of the recommended reforms, you should consider the extent to which it will be able to improve the ability of the criminal justice system to achieve the principles of justice.\nRecommended reforms addressing costs factorsRECOMMENDED REFORMS\nIn your exam, you \ncannot make up or invent reforms. You should only use reforms that have been recommended by a formal law reform body such as the VLRC, a formal inquiry, a professional organisation such as the LIV or a professional advocate, spokesperson or individual, or a recommended reform which is receiving media attention.Study/uni00A0tip\n\u2022 Increase in funding for legal assistance \u2013 \nThe Victorian Access to Justice Review Report \nrecommended that additional state funding be provided for legal assistance, with priority for duty lawyer services, family violence- r elated services \nand Aboriginal legal services. It also recommended that the proportion of Commonwealth funding for legal assistance be increased, and that a transparent funding model with the Commonwealth Government be entered into which takes into account population growth and service demand. Although the Commonwealth and Victorian Governments have agreed to increase funding, that funding is unlikely to meet demand for legal/uni00A0aid.\n\u2022 Impr oving the availability of pro bono services \u2013 The Victorian Access to Justice Review Report \nrecommends that the Victorian Government, Justice Connect and the legal profession work together to improve pro bono services, which includes developing an online tool or website portal on which community legal centres or other organisations that require pro bono assistance can advertise their \nneed and be matched with lawyers who can assist. The Victorian Government in May 2017 agreed to implement this recommendation.\n\u2022 Alternative funding options \u2013 The Australian Bar Association (ABA) and other organisations \nare considering and investigating sources of funding other than government funding. This is to ease the pressure of the growing need for legal services. The ABA is considering alternatives such as legal assistance funds that build up money from special levies, such as a \u2018speeding \ufb01nes/uni00A0levy\u2019 .\nRecommended reforms addressing time factors\n\u2022 Abolition of committal proceedings \u2013 In 2012, it was reported that the Victorian Government \nwas considering abolishing committal proceedings, saying they were causing backlogs because of an unnecessary examination of cases. Some people believe that committal proceedings remain a problem and add to delays in the criminal justice system. Committal hearings were abolished in New Zealand in 2011 and there remains some support for their abolition, but it is not currently a government priority.\n\u2022 Case management by Supreme Court \u2013 In a 2017 discussion paper on reforms to criminal \nprocedure, the Victorian Government sought public submissions on \ufb02exible early case management. It proposed reforms for some indictable o\ufb00ence cases to allow the Supreme Court to manage those cases from the time a person is charged through to trial. The proposal would reduce delays, for example, by eliminating the need to revisit issues in di\ufb00erent courts and resolving issues early in proceedings.Australian Bar \nAssociation (ABA), the the main organisation that represents barristers in Australia. It aims to promote the rule of law and advocates for fair and equal access to justice for all\ncase management \na method used by courts and tribunals to control the progress of legal cases more effectively and efficiently.

The Victorian Government has accepted this recommendation and has committed additional funds for interpreter services, but it is unclear whether this funding will be adequate. \n\u2022 Continued focus and expansion of Koori Court system \u2013 There continues to be calls for the Koori Court to be expanded into other areas of Victoria. It is expected that the County Koori Court will expand so that it sits in additional parts of Victoria.\nRecommended reforms addressing other factors\n\u2022 Trials by judge alone \u2013 In 2017, following the charging of Cardinal \nGeorge Pell for historic sex o\ufb00ences, it was reported that two senior barristers had questioned whether there should be an option for trials by judge alone in high-pro\ufb01le cases. They suggested that jurors might be unable to act impartially at Cardinal Pell\u2019s trial, and that Victoria should adopt a model that allowed a judge to determine guilt in some/uni00A0trials. \n\u2022 Appointment of professional intermediaries \u2013 The Victorian \nLaw Reform Commission recommended that a scheme be established to appoint professionals who would assist in obtaining evidence from child victims and victims who have a disability. A/uni00A0 similar scheme operates in England and Wales. In May 2017, the Victorian Government announced that it would invest money to introduce intermediaries who will work with victims to help them give evidence.\nThe ability of/uni00A0recommended reforms to/uni00A0achieve \nthe/uni00A0principles of/uni00A0justice\nY ou should be able to discuss each of your recommended reforms in light of their ability to achieve the \nprinciples of justice, and the extent to which they can overcome the factors that a\ufb00ect the achievement of justice.\nTo do so, you should consider the following questions for each recommended reform:\n\u2022 What problem, di\ufb03culty or issue is it trying to overcome?\n\u2022 Is it a short- term or long- term solution?\u2022 What principles of justice is the reform intended to achieve?\u2022 Are there any criticisms of the recommended reform?\u2022 W hat else needs to be done in addition to the reform, or is it a \u2018total solution\u2019 to the problem, di\ufb03culty \nor issue it is trying to overcome?Before your exam, \nyou should check to find out whether these recommended reforms have been implemented.

June has been the subject of violent beatings from her ex- husband, from whom she separated 3/uni00A0months ago.  They have  no children.\nOne night, June\u2019s ex- husband arrived at her house \ndrunk. He pushed his way  into the house and started \nbeating her.

June managed to get  up, walked \nto the co\ufb00ee table where there was  a large ornament \nshe had bought on a recent trip to  Daylesford, and \nhit her ex- husband over  the head. He fell and was  \nunconscious. June called the police. She has been arrested for  attempted murder after her ex- husband \nsurvived. He has su\ufb00ered signi\ufb01cant brain injuries as a/uni00A0result.\nJune does not have  a lawyer, and has been relying \non people around her to  tell her what her options are.  \nOne of her friends told her that there is a new Koori Court that has opened up in Mildura which will enable June to  be sentenced there. Another friend told her that she\u2019s sure that June will have  to give  evidence \nvia closed- circuit television because she\u2019s a victim. Another friend has told her that she\u2019s heard that June can access legal aid and it\u2019s pretty easy to get  a lawyer.\nPractice assessment/uni00A0task questions \nPrepare a paper which addresses the following issues:\n1 An explanation to  June about who the main parties in \nthe trial are, including who she will be known as. \n(3/uni00A0marks)\n2 Whether or not each of June\u2019s friends is right in their \nsuggestions, and the reason for your answer. \n(6/uni00A0marks)\n3 The two difficulties that June will most likely face  \nduring her trial, the reason why you say these \nare most likely, and how they will impact on the \nachievement of justice. \n(8/uni00A0marks)4 Two aspects of the criminal justice system  that may \naddress those two difficulties, and the reasons why you say that is so. \n(4/uni00A0marks)\n5 The extent to  which one recent reform or \nrecommended reform to  the criminal justice system  \nmay as \nsist in achieving justice in June\u2019s trial. \n(4/uni00A0marks)\nTotal:/uni00A025/uni00A0marks\nSource 1 After beating her, June\u2019s ex-husband sat down \non her couch and turned on the TV.\n05_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   171 9/10/2017   5:25 PM",

  "Page 186": "174  UNIT 3  RIGHTS AND JUSTICE6.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE CIVIL \nJUSTICE/uni00A0SYSTEM\nThe civil justice system is a set of methods, processes and institutions used to resolve civil disputes. It \nincludes dispute resolution bodies and processes such/uni00A0as:\n\u2022 pre- trial procedures (such as providing documents to the other side which are relevant to the dispute)\u2022 dispute resolution methods (such as mediation)\u2022 dispute resolution bodies, such as complaints bodies, tribunals and/uni00A0courts\u2022 the ordering and enforcement of remedies.\nSome of the key purposes of the civil justice system are to enable a person to enforce their legal rights \nor take action over legal wrongs, determine whether the defendant is liable to that person, and award a \nremedy where the defendant has been found liable.\nAs in the criminal justice system, the resolution of a civil dispute has a number of key stages. However, \nbecause there are di\ufb00erent ways to resolve a civil dispute, the stages can be di\ufb00erent from case to case. An example of the stages that a civil dispute resolved in a court may go through is provided in Source/uni00A01.\nCivil cases in/uni00A0Victoria\nThe law- making power in civil law is generally held by the six states and two territories of the \nCommonwealth of Australia.

For example, the Australian Consumer Law is a law passed by the Commonwealth Parliament and adopted as state legislation, so it operates at both Commonwealth and state levels to provide for fair trading and consumer protection. Civil disputes may arise because the Australian Consumer Law has not been complied with (for example, if a person makes a representation about the quality of goods sold, which is found to be false). The Commonwealth Parliament also has some law- making powers in relation to industrial disputes (employee disputes) that are beyond the limits of any/uni00A0state.remedy \na term used to describe any order made by a court designed to address a civil wrong or breach.

  "Page 187": "175  CHAPTER  6 INTRODUCTION TO THE/uni00A0VICTORIAN CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM Parties to/uni00A0a civil dispute\nEvery civil dispute involves two parties:\n\u2022 the plainti\ufb00 \u2013 i.e. the party who commences a civil action. The plainti\ufb00 is also known as the \naggrieved/uni00A0party.\n\u2022 the defendant \u2013 i.e. the party who is alleged to have infringed the rights or caused wrongdoing.\nSometimes there can be multiple plainti\ufb00s, and multiple defendants, in a civil action. For example, \nif two people both own a property that has been damaged, they both may be plainti\ufb00s. Similarly, if two \npeople have damaged another person\u2019s property, they both may be defendants.\nA party who has a valid legal claim can bring a civil action against the defendant, also known as suing \nor litigating. The aim of a civil action is to obtain a remedy that will compensate the plainti\ufb00 if they are successful (e.g. by restoring them to the position they were in before the breach occurred, or ordering the defendant to do something). When a defendant has done something that can\u2019t be reversed (e.g. if a \ufb01nger was cut o\ufb00 in an accident they caused), the only legal solution may be compensating the person whose rights have been infringed, and who has su\ufb00ered loss or injury as a result, by paying an amount of money. This is the civil remedy known as damages.\nThe parties to a civil dispute can be one of the following:\n\u2022 an individual suing or being sued in their own name, or a group of individuals suing or being sued together\n\u2022 a corporation, otherwise known as a company \u2013  a separate legal entity from the directors or individuals \nwho run the company, which can sue and be/uni00A0sued\n\u2022 a government body (e.g. the state of Victoria, a local council or a statutory authority such as Victoria Police).\nChildren\nA child under the age of 18 can sue another person or group through a litigation guardian, often known as a \u2018next friend\u2019 . This is usually a parent or guardian. The action they bring on behalf of the child is called a representative action.\nChildren can also be sued. The extent of their legal liability depends on the child\u2019s level of maturity \nand the behaviour expected of a child of that/uni00A0age.\nEmployers\nIf an employee infringes a person\u2019s rights while acting in the course of his or her employment, the injured person may be able to sue the employer. This is because of the concept of  vicarious \nliability (responsibility for the actions of another person). The reason for making the employer liable is that employers have a right, ability and duty to control the activities of their employees. For example, if an employee chef is negligent in the preparation of food, which then poisons someone, the employer is likely to be sued. The important fact that must be established is that the employee was acting \u2018in the course of employment\u2019 .\nY ou will learn more about vicarious liability in \nTopic 6.4 of this chapter.\nvicarious liability \nthe legal responsibility of a third party/uni00A0for/uni00A0the wrongful acts of another (e.g. an employer\u2019s liability for what their employees do)plainti\ufb00 (in civil disputes) the party who makes a legal claim against another person (i.e. the defendant) in court\ndefendant \n(in a civil case) a party who is alleged to have breached a civil law and who is being sued by a plaintiff\nliability \nlegal responsibility for one\u2019s acts or omissionssue \nto take civil action against another person, claiming that they infringed some legal right of the plaintiff (or did some legal wrong that negatively affected the plaintiff)\ndamages \nthe most common remedy in a civil claim; an amount of money that the court (or tribunal) orders one party to pay to another\nDid you/uni00A0know?\nIn some dispute resolution bodies, words other than \u2018plaintiff\u2019 and \u2018defendant\u2019 are used to describe the parties involved. For example, in the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, \u2018applicant\u2019 is used to describe the person bringing a civil action, and \u2018respondent\u2019 is used to describe the person defending the action.\nSource 2 A child under the age of 18 can sue another person or group through a litigation guardian.\n06_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   175 10/10/2017   10:36 AM",

For example, when parents get a divorce or separate, they will need to  sort out the way  they will share property and arrange \nfor the care of children.Breach of contract actions arise where someone has failed to  \ndo something they promised in a legally binding agreement. For example, you might pay in advance for a new car, but when \nthe time comes for delivery you find out the dealer sold it to  \nsomeone else for more money, in breach of your contract.TYPES OF CIVIL DISPUTES\nDefamation relates to  saying or publishing material which \ncauses damage to  another person\u2019s reputation. For example, \na newspaper article might falsely report that a business owner has committed fraud, which drives customers away.Nuisance claims are made by people that have lost  enjoyment \nor use of property (either public or private). For example, a stench coming from a nearby factory is a legal nuisance because it interferes with a person\u2019s ability to  enjoy their\n home.\nTrespass occurs when someone goes onto another person\u2019s land without permission. For example, a news photographer who refuses to  leave your home when asked to  go is\ntrespassing on the property.\nWills and inheritance claims involve disputes over  a will. For example a frail old man might be pressured into making a will that \nleaves all his money to  a scam artist. The family could go to  court to  claim that the will was not valid.Negligence occurs when someone owes a duty of care to  \nanother and breaches that duty, causing harm or loss to  them. \nFor example, a doctor might carelessly cut an artery during a \nmedical procedure.\nCheck your obook assess for  these additional resources and more:\n\u00bb Student book \nquestions\n6.1 Check your learning\u00bb Video Tutorial\nIntroduction to  Chapter 6\u00bb Video\nCivil justice\u00bb Video worksheet\nCivil justice\n06_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   177 10/10/2017   10:36 AM",
  "Page 190": "178  UNIT 3  RIGHTS AND JUSTICE6.2 \nIn Unit 3 \u2013 Area of Study 1 you studied the principles of justice when looking at the criminal justice \nsystem, and evaluated the ability of the criminal justice system to achieve the principles of justice. The principles of justice/uni00A0are:\n\u2022 fairness\n\u2022 equality\n\u2022 access.A brief overview of the three principles of justice, and how they relate to the civil justice system, is \nprovided/uni00A0below.\nFairness\nIn the civil justice system, fairness means fair processes and a fair hearing (or trial). This means/uni00A0that:\u2022 both parties should know the case against them and be given the opportunity to present their/uni00A0case\u2022 the dispute resolution processes should operate so that neither party is disadvantaged, and that people \nare treated impartially without fear or favour\n\u2022 \nthe parties should be able to understand court processes and be able to participate in the hearing or trial.\nFor example, if the plainti\ufb00 claims that the defendant signed a contract and breached that contract, \nthe/uni00A0defendant should have an opportunity to know what documents and evidence support those claims. They should also have an opportunity to present their side of the story. \nFairness in a civil case does not mean that every plainti\ufb00 should have the same outcome or remedy for \nevery dispute of the same nature. As in the criminal justice system, \u2018one size \ufb01ts all\u2019 can lead to an unfair outcome. For example, if a famous young concert violinist loses a \ufb01nger, the impact on their career will be much worse than the impact on a retired postal worker with the same injury. Therefore, it is possible that the remedy awarded for the violinist will be greater than that given to the postal worker. \nFairness in a civil dispute also means that there should be a fair hearing or trial, and that the processes \ninvolved at every step should be fair.

Throughout Chapters/uni00A06, 7 and 8, you should keep these principles in mind when considering whether the civil justice system achieves justice. Make notes when you identify aspects of the civil justice system that achieve or do not achieve one or more of/uni00A0these principles.\nSource 2 Fairness and equality are sometimes the same thing \u2013 but not always\nEquality\nIn the civil justice system, equality means that all people should be treated equally before the law, with an \nequal opportunity to present their case. No person or group should be treated favourably or unfavourably because of a certain attribute or characteristic. \nThat is, the processes should be free from bias or prejudice, and the people who help to resolve a civil \ndispute, or make orders in a case, should be impartial. They should not be deciding for reasons that are not relevant to the case. The Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic) states that every Victorian has the right to be equal before the law and the right to equal protection of the law without discrimination.\nIn Unit 3 \u2013 Area of Study 2, you will learn about the civil justice system and make some assessments \nabout whether it achieves equality for parties in civil disputes. Some of the aspects of the civil justice system that relate to equality include:\n\u2022 the impartiality of a judge and jury when resolving civil disputes\u2022 the extent to which the civil justice system is available to everyone\u2022 the disadvantage that particular groups in society may su\ufb00er because of features of the civil justice \nsystem (such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, vulnerable witnesses or people with disabilities) \n\u2022 the extent to which the availability and skill of legal representation impacts on people being treated equally before the/uni00A0law \n\u2022 the ability of people to be equally represented and able to present their/uni00A0case\n\u2022 the availability of legal representation to individuals who have little or no/uni00A0money.\n06_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   179 10/10/2017   10:36 AM",

  "Page 194": "182  UNIT  3 RIGHT S AND JUSTICE6.3 KEY CONCEPTS IN THE VICTORIAN CIVIL \nJUSTICE/uni00A0SYSTEM\nThere are  three key  concepts in the Victorian civil justice system that you  need to  become familiar with. \nThey/uni00A0are:\n\u2022 the burden of proof \u2013 which side has to  prove  the/uni00A0case\n\u2022 the standard of proof  \u2013 the level of certainty the judge, magistrate or jury must have  in deciding the \ndispute\n\u2022 representative proceeding \u2013 a proceeding in the name of one person, on behalf of a group. \nThe burden of/uni00A0proof\nAs you  learnt in Chapter/uni00A03, the burden of proof refers to  the onus or responsibility that one party has to  \nprove  the facts of the case.  The burden of proof lies with the person or party who is bringing the case.  In \na civil dispute, this is the plainti\ufb00. When a plainti\ufb00 sues a defendant, it is the plainti\ufb00 who has to  show that \nthe defendant was  in the wrong. This follows the principle that the party who brings the case has to  satisfy \nthe court (or tribunal) that their claim is supported by  the facts they can/uni00A0prove.\nThere are  times when the defendant has the burden of proof in a civil dispute. This is normally when \nthe defendant makes a counterclaim against the plainti\ufb00. The  defendant is then making a direct claim \nagainst the plainti\ufb00, and will have  the onus of proving that claim. Further, if a defendant raises a particular \ndefence (e.g. the defence of contributory negligence in a negligence claim, claiming that the plainti\ufb00  \ncontributed to  the harm su\ufb00ered), then the defendant will also be responsible for  proving that defence.\nThe standard of/uni00A0proof\nThe standard of proof refers to the strength of \nevidence needed to  prove  the case.  In a civil dispute, \nthe plainti\ufb00 must prove  the case (or the defendant \nmust prove  the counterclaim or a certain defence) \non the balance  of probabilities. This means that \nthe party must prove  that they are  most probably or \nmost likely in the right, and the other party is most \nprobably in the wrong. This is a less strict standard of proof than \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 in criminal/uni00A0cases.\nRepresentative proceedings\nIf a group of people all have  claims against the same party, they may  be able to  join together to  commence \na civil action known as a class action. A/uni00A0class action is the main type of representative proceeding, which \nis brought in the name of one person on behalf of someone else. It can be commenced/uni00A0if:\n\u2022 seven  or more people have  claims against the same/uni00A0person\n\u2022 tho se claims relate to  the same, similar or related circumstances,/uni00A0and\n\u2022 the same issues need to  be decided (e.g. whether the defendant owed  a duty of  care  to those plainti\ufb00s).\nIf those three things apply, a representative proceeding may  be commenced by  a person who is part of  \nthe group. They  will \u2018represent\u2019 the group in the proceeding. That  person is known as the lead plainti\ufb00. \nThe persons who are  part of the group are  known as group members. burden of/uni00A0proof  \nthe obligation (i.e.  \nresponsibility) of a  \nparty to  prove  a case.  \nThe burden of proof  \nusually rests with the  \nparty who initiates the  \naction (i.e. the plaintiff  \nin a civil dispute and  \nthe prosecution in a  \ncriminal case)\nstandard of proof  \nthe degree or extent to  \nwhich a case must be  \nproved  in court\nrepresentative  \nproceeding  \na legal proceeding in  \nwhich a group of people  \nwho have a claim based  \non similar or related  \nfacts bring that claim  \nto court in the name of  \none person; also called  \na class action or a  \ngroup proceedingcounterclaim \na separate claim  \nmade by the defendant  \nin response to  the \nplaintiff\u2019s claim (and  \nheard at the same time  \nby the court)\nbalance of probabilities  \nthe standard of proof  \nin civil disputes.

A/uni00A0person or group who does so might not win the case, and \nthe legal fees may be expensive. It can also be time- consuming and stressful, and might lead to negative \npublicity. It is therefore important for a person initiating a civil claim to consider factors such as who they \nshould sue, whether they are restricted from suing, and whether they can try and resolve the claim before doing/uni00A0so.\nSomeone deciding whether to initiate a civil claim may consider the following \ufb01ve factors before \ndoing/uni00A0so:\n\u2022 negotiation options\n\u2022 costs\u2022 limitation of actions\n\u2022 the scope of liability\u2022 enforcement issues.\nOne or more of these factors may impact on whether a party decides to sue, and if so, who they sue. \nA/uni00A0consideration of the \ufb01rst two factors is/uni00A0set out in this topic. The last three factors are explored in Topic 6.5.\nNegotiation options \nOne of the considerations for a plainti\ufb00 is whether the dispute can be resolved out of court or tribunal. In \nsome circumstances, it may be available to the plainti\ufb00 to try and negotiate a resolution of the dispute directly with the defendant without initiating a claim, or the parties may be able to agree on what the issues are during negotiation.\nNegotiation normally involves the parties interacting directly with each other to try and resolve the \ndispute. This may be with or without legal representation, and normally involves informal discussions between themselves about the issues in dispute, what the plainti\ufb00 is seeking, and what the other party is prepared to do to resolve the dispute.\nHowever, other possible negotiation options may include:\n\u2022 arranging between themselves, with or without legal representation, an independent third party, \nsuch as a mediator, to help resolve the dispute. The independent third party or mediator is neutral and impartial and will help the parties come to their own agreement about how to resolve the dispute. This is often known as a \u2018facilitated negotiation\u2019 .negotiation \ninformal discussions between two or more parties in dispute, aiming to come to an agreement about how to resolve that dispute\nlimitation of actions \nthe restriction on bringing a civil claim after the allowed time\nmediator \nan independent third party who does not interfere or persuade but helps the parties in a mediation as they try reach a settlement of the matterStudy/uni00A0tip\nThese five factors are specifically listed in the VCE Legal Studies Study Design. You should be familiar with each of these five factors, and you should be able to analyse them. Try and think of and use as many scenarios as you can in which one or more of these factors may be a consideration for a plaintiff in deciding whether or not to sue a defendant. This will help you analyse any series of facts in which these factors are present.\n06_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   186 10/10/2017   10:36 AM",

Though this depends on the case and the parties involved, some of those reasons include:\n\u2022 one or both of the parties does or do not want to resolve the dispute, or \nis or are not interested in negotiating\n\u2022 ther e have already been attempts to negotiate the dispute, and they \nhave/uni00A0failed\n\u2022 one of the parties has been harmed or threatened by the other party, there has been violence involved, or there is distrust or fear among the parties\n\u2022 ther e are no issues or dispute to be negotiated (for example, a neighbour is annoyed by a one- o\ufb00  event \nwhen his or her neighbour played loud music, and that neighbour has now/uni00A0moved)\n\u2022 it is unlikely that negotiation will result in a successful outcome (for example, the claim made by the plainti\ufb00 is unreasonable)\n\u2022 ther e is an urgency in having the matter resolved through court (for example, a construction company \nis about to destroy a local heritage site and the plainti\ufb00 wants an urgent court order stopping that from happening)\n\u2022 ther e is a signi\ufb01cant power imbalance between the parties, and so the parties are not on an equal \nfooting to be able to negotiate (for example, a young employee who has a claim against his or her employer who has signi\ufb01cant legal representation).\nThese reasons will need to be considered when determining whether a party should try and negotiate \nbefore initiating a/uni00A0claim.\nSome of these reasons why negotiation may not be an option are demonstrated in the below example \nabout Mary\u2019s dispute with her neighbour.\nPersistent abusive messages\nMary\u2019s neighbour has set up a music studio in his backyard shed. Between midnight and 3 am \nevery morning, he plays loudly on the drums and other musical instruments. Mary has been unable to sleep at night, and her work is suffering as a result.\nOn at least five occasions, Mary has approached her neighbour and asked that he stop. Her \nneighbour laughs every time and asks Mary \u2018who does she think she is\u2019 and insists that he has a right to play music on his own property. On the last occasion, Mary told her neighbour she would go and see a lawyer.\nSince that time, Mary has received abusive messages from her neighbour. Her lawyer has \nadvised her not to approach him again, and that she is not to try and negotiate any resolution.EXAMPLE\nSometimes, it might be necessary to show to a court that there have been steps taken to try and \nresolve the dispute. For example, the Federal Court of Australia requires a person to take genuine steps to resolve a dispute before issuing a claim. One of the steps that could be taken is attempting to negotiate \n06_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   187 10/10/2017   10:36 AM",

In the County Court and the Supreme Court, the daily jury fee is from $550 to more than $1 000, depending on how long the jury trial/uni00A0is.\nTribunal costs are generally less than court costs, but usually include application fees and hearing fees.\nMediation/uni00A0fees\nWhen a plainti\ufb00 initiates a claim in court, the court will often order the parties to attend mediation to try \nand resolve the case before trial. They are likely to share the costs of the mediator. Mediators\u2019 fees can vary depending on the mediator and the nature of the claim, but can be anywhere between $2 000 and $20  000 per/uni00A0day.\nExpert witness/uni00A0fees\nThe plainti\ufb00\u2019s claim may require an expert to give an opinion, depending on the nature of the claim. For example, if the plainti\ufb00 claims that she has su\ufb00ered a severe spinal injury, she may need to engage a \nmedical expert to prove this injury.\nAdverse costs/uni00A0orders\nIf the plainti\ufb00 initiates a claim in court, and is unsuccessful, then not only will they have to pay for their \nown legal costs, but they may be ordered to pay for some of the defendant\u2019s costs. This is known as an adverse costs order.\nThe general rule in civil disputes is that a successful party should receive an order from the court that \nhis or her costs are paid by the losing/uni00A0party. \nOften the fear of having an adverse costs order made against them will deter a plainti\ufb00 from initiating \na civil claim.

For  example, legal aid is not available for  business and commercial  \ndisputes, employment disputes, disputes on behalf of  corporations, internal disputes in organisations and wills  \nand deceased estates. In addition, legal aid provided by  VLA largely goes to  criminal and family matters, with  \nvery little left for  those who are  defending a  civil claim, or want to  initiate a  civil claim.  \nFurther, the strict tests applied by  VLA means that many people are  not eligible to  receive legal aid. \nFor example, the Productivity Commission in 2014 estimated in its Access to  Justice Arrangements \nreport that only 8 per cent of households would likely meet the tests for  legal aid.

Limitation of actions refers to the restriction placed on the time within which a civil action can be commenced. \nFor most types of claims, the plainti\ufb00 will need to commence the proceeding within a certain number of months or years. Once that period has passed, the defendant may be able to raise a defence that the plainti\ufb00 is out of time and can no longer bring the/uni00A0claim.\nThe rationale for imposing limitations on the plainti\ufb00 is so/uni00A0that:\n\u2022 the defendant does not have to face an action after a signi\ufb01cant amount of/uni00A0time\n\u2022 evidence is not lost and people can still remember what happened\u2022 disputes can be resolved as quickly as possible, so as to promote social cohesion.\nIn Victoria, the main statute that imposes limitations on actions is the Limitation of Actions Act 1958 \n(Vic). Source 1 below is a summary of the time limits within which an action for certain types of civil \nclaims must be issued. The date from which the time starts running depends on the type of claim. For example, for a breach of contract claim, the time starts running from the date of the breach.\nAlthough there are time \nlimits for commencing most civil claims, there is no time limit for prosecuting an accused for an indictable offence. However, for summary offences, generally, the proceeding must be commenced within 12/uni00A0months of the offence.Did you/uni00A0know?\nThe e\ufb00ect of the expiry of any limitation period means that the plainti\ufb00 will be barred from obtaining \nany remedy. However, the defendant will be required to raise it as a defence (that is, the defendant will \nneed to say that the plainti\ufb00 is time- bar red from issuing the claim). In some situations, the limitation \nperiod can be extended.\nIn 2015, Victoria became the \ufb01rst state to remove limitation periods for persons who su\ufb00ered \nphysical or sexual abuse as a minor, or psychological abuse that arose out of that abuse. The \nchanges to the law followed a Victorian parliamentary inquiry into the handling of child abuse by \nreligious and other non- g overnment organisations which found that time limitations were a major \nhurdle for victims who wished to initiate civil claims. On the next page is an example of a case \nwhere the limitation period was extended.\nSource 2 The changes to limitation periods in cases of sexual and physical abuse inflicted on minors \ncame about following a parliamentary committee report into the handling of child abuse by religious and other non- government organisations, which was handed down in November/uni00A02013.limitation of actions/uni00A0 the restriction on bringing a civil claim after the allowed time\nsocial cohesion \na term used to describe the willingness of members of a society to cooperate with each other in order to survive and prosper\nstatute \na law made by parliament; a bill which has passed through parliament and has received royal assent (also known as an Act of Parliament)\n06_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   191 10/10/2017   10:36 AM",

In a contract claim, this will be the other party to  the contract. In a \nnegligence claim, the defendant will be the person who breached his or her duty of  care  to the plainti\ufb00.\nSometimes there may  be two  or more persons who have  infringed the plainti\ufb00\u2019s rights or caused harm \nto the plainti\ufb00, and both of them may  become liable for  loss or damage su\ufb00ered by  the plainti\ufb00.\nHowever, there may  be a party other than the person who directly infringed the plainti\ufb00\u2019s rights who \nthe plainti\ufb00  may  sue, and may  be liable to  compensate the plainti\ufb00. Those  parties may  include:\n\u2022 an employer (under the principle of vicarious liability)\n\u2022 an insurer\u2022 a person who was  involved in the wrongdoing (under the principle of accessorial liability).\naccessorial liability \na way  in which a person \ncan be found to  be \nresponsible or liable for the loss or harm \nsuffered to  another \nbecause they were directly or indirectly involved in causing the loss or harm (for example, encouraging another person to  \ncause that harm)\nSource 3 If a person slipped on spilt milk in a supermarket the plaintiff could sue the employer, an insurer \nand the worker who ignored the spill.EMPLOYERS\n INSURERS\nPERSONS INVOLVED IN\nWRONGDOING\nLimitations extended in child abuse/uni00A0case\nGGG v YYY [2011] VSC 429 (1 September/uni00A02011)\nIn GGG  v YYY, the plaintiff was  a 45- year- old man who claimed damages for  sexual abuse \nallegedly inflicted upon him by the defendant between 1977 and 1979. The defendant was  one \nof the plaintiff\u2019s uncles, who was 81/uni00A0years old in/uni00A02011.\nOne of the issues the Supreme Court of Victoria had to  decide was  whether the limitation \nperiod should be extended. This case was  heard before the Victorian Parliament had passed \nlaws which removed limitation periods for  persons who suffered physical or sexual abuse as \na/uni00A0minor.\nThe Court found that the claim was  statute- barred, but decided to  extend the limitation \nperiod. Justice Osborn accepted that one of the reasons for  the delay was  because the plaintiff \nwas not physically able to  publicly acknowledge the fact of the abuse, and was not aware of his \npsychiatric injury, until 2009. Justice Osborn did not consider that the delay had prevented a  fair \ntrial and had not resulted in any real prejudice. He ultimately awarded a  total  of $267 000 in \ndamages to  the victim.LEGAL\nCASE\n06_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   192 10/10/2017   10:36 AM",

This means there must have been some connection between the act and the employment. If the employee was acting in an unauthorised way, then the employer may not be found liable.\nAs demonstrated in the legal case below, the plainti\ufb00 must show that the defendant was acting in the \ncourse of employment to sue on the principle of vicarious liability.\nA prank gone/uni00A0wrong\nBlake v J R Perry Nominees Pty Ltd [2012] VSCA 122 (14 June/uni00A02012)\nTrevor Blake was a fuel tank driver employed by J R Perry Nominees Pty Ltd. On 16 October 2001, Blake was at the Portland dockyards waiting for a ship which was due to be refuelled, whose arrival had been delayed. Two other employees were also waiting. While Blake was looking out to sea, Jones, one of the other employees, drove his fuel tanker at Blake as a prank, and hit him behind the knees. The blow caused severe damage to Blake\u2019s back, and Blake has never recovered from the damage. Blake sued his employer, claiming it was vicariously liable. The judge disagreed, and Blake appealed to the Court of Appeal in the Supreme/uni00A0Court.\nBlake lost on appeal. The Court of Appeal stated that if vicarious liability is to arise, there \nmust be some connection between the wrongdoer\u2019s wrongful act and his or her employment. In this case, the Court held that the actions of Jones were not authorised by his employer, and were not done to further the employer\u2019s interests. It held that it was the spontaneous act of a prankster and the act did not take place within the course of his employment.LEGAL\nCASE\nSource 4 Prince Alfred College in South Australia was at the centre of a 2016 High Court decision in \nrelation to vicarious liability.\nIn the 2016 case of Prince Alfred College Incorporated v ADC (2016) 335 ALR 1, the High Court ruled \nthat it is possible for an employer to be vicariously liable for a criminal o\ufb00ence committed by an employee. Whether the employer is liable for a criminal o\ufb00ence will depend on any special role of the employee. For example, if the employee was in a position of authority, power or trust and was able to be intimate with the victim, the employer may be vicariously liable. In this case, the victim was a boarder at a college who was sexually abused by Dean Bain, employed by the school as a housemaster. However, the High Court did not \ufb01nd the employer vicariously liable because it held that the victim was out of time to bring his/uni00A0claim.High Court \nthe ultimate court of appeal in Australia and the court with the authority to hear and determine disputes arising under the Australian Constitution\nvictim  \na person who has suffered directly or indirectly as a result of a crime\n06_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   193 10/10/2017   10:36 AM",

The plainti\ufb00 can\u2019t make a direct \nclaim against the defendant\u2019s insurer, but if the plainti\ufb00 is successful, the defendant will then claim on the \ninsurer for the loss.

For example, if a person was harassed at work, and somebody else encouraged or \nactively in\ufb02uenced the harasser to keep doing it, then the other person may be seen to also be responsible for the harm su\ufb00ered by the person.\nIn the below example, Andrew could sue Sally\u2019s husband Ian because of accessorial liability./uni00A0 \nAndrew\u2019s bakery\u2019s not so scrumptious\nAndrew recently purchased a bakery business from Sally. During his research on the business, he was told by Sally that the bakery made $200 000 profit a year. Andrew attended the bakery several times during the course of three months. Every time he attended, Ian, Sally\u2019s husband, was working at the bakery and would often rave about how much money they were making. Ian at some time showed Andrew some statements which indicated that the profit was about $200 000 a/uni00A0year.\nAfter a few months of business, Andrew is struggling to make money. He later finds out that \nIan\u2019s statements were not true, and that Ian\u2019s handwritten statements contained false profit numbers. Andrew believes he has been misled about the true value of the/uni00A0bakery.EXAMPLE\nThe extent of/uni00A0the defendant\u2019s liability\nOne of the other issues that may arise for a plainti\ufb00, and which he or she will need to consider before bringing an action, is the extent to which the defendant is liable. That is, the defendant may argue that if they are found liable, then they are only liable for a part or a portion of the plainti\ufb00\u2019s loss or damage.\nThis often arises in negligence claims, when the defendant may claim contributory negligence. This \nis when the defendant may try to prove that the plainti\ufb00 is in part to blame for the harm done.

Kalos sued her employer and the owner of the premises for negligence, claiming that she fell on a protruding and exposed metal plate on the/uni00A0floor.\nOne of the defendants claimed that Kalos was contributory negligent because she failed \nto keep a proper lookout and failed to pay attention to where she was walking. The County Court found that there was no evidence to support a finding of contributory negligence. A/uni00A0total amount of $688 000 in damages was awarded to Kalos against Kalos\u2019 employer, but found there was no breach by the owner of the premises.LEGAL\nCASE\nEnforcement/uni00A0issues\nNormally, there are two ways that a plainti\ufb00 will obtain a settlement or remedy:\n\u2022 by settling with the defendant before the court or tribunal hands down a decision\u2022 by obtaining a remedy from a dispute resolution body such as a/uni00A0court.\nBut what happens if a court orders an amount of money to be paid to a plainti\ufb00, or the defendant \nagrees to pay a sum of money, but the defendant does not/uni00A0pay? That is, will the plainti\ufb00 be able to enforce \nthe remedy they have been awarded?\nThe plainti\ufb00 will need to consider whether the defendant is able to pay, and if so, whether or not the \ndefendant will pay. Some of the issues that the plainti\ufb00 will need to consider/uni00A0are:\n\u2022 the defendant may be bankrupt, which means that he or she will not have any assets or money to pay \nanything to the plainti\ufb00\n\u2022 even if the defendant is not bankrupt, he or she may still be unable to/uni00A0pay \n\u2022 the defendant may be in jail, particularly if the civil dispute arose out of a criminal action, and the \ndefendant has been found guilty and imprisoned. It will therefore be more di\ufb03cult to enforce the remedy \n\u2022 if the defendant is a company, that company may not have any/uni00A0assets\n\u2022 the defendant may be overseas or uncontactable, in which case it may be di\ufb03cult to force them to pay \nany/uni00A0money\n\u2022 the plainti\ufb00 may not even know who the defendant is. For example, the plainti\ufb00 may have been harassed in a public park late at night and has su\ufb00ered anxiety and depression as a result, but the police have not been able to locate the defendant.\nEven if the defendant is able to pay, the plainti\ufb00 may have to issue enforcement proceedings to force \na defendant to comply with a remedy. An example of an enforcement mechanism is obtaining from the \ncourt a warrant to direct the court sheri\ufb00 to seize (take) the defendant\u2019s goods and sell/uni00A0them.defendant is successful, then the defendant\u2019s liability for the loss or damage is likely to be reduced, often signi\ufb01cantly.\nThe defendant may also argue that someone other than the plainti\ufb00 was liable, and therefore try to \nreduce his or her liability. For example, the defendant may argue that somebody else caused the loss su\ufb00ered by the plainti\ufb00.\nIn the case of Kalos v Goodyear & Dunlop Tyres (Aust) Pty Ltd [2016] VSC 715, the defendant attempted \nto claim contributory negligence to reduce their liability but was unsuccessful.\n06_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   195 10/10/2017   10:36 AM",

They had a lovely ceremony in the Botanic Gardens, followed by  a cocktail evening at the local \nrestaurant, Insightful Nights. The local restaurant had arranged catering from a local catering company, Snailed Bottles Pty Ltd. Snailed Bottles Pty Ltd  put on \na huge spread of food and drink. One of the signature dishes of the night was  a warm  chocolate mousse served \nin a chocolate nest, which was  created by  a local dessert \nchef, Andrea McChock.\nThe next day,  Penny felt awful and was  diagnosed with \ngastroenteritis. She vomited all day  and all night, and \nwas eventually hospitalised due to  severe dehydration \nand a high fever.  She spent \ufb01ve/uni00A0days in hospital. She \ndiscovered a few  weeks later that at least \ufb01ve  other \nguests of hers also su\ufb00ered the same thing, and with the same severity. They worked out that they had all eaten the chocolate mousse. Penny is not sure whether there is anyone else who also got  sick from her wedding, \nbut hasn\u2019t yet  contacted everyone. One of the guests who did fall sick was  a pregnant woman who has since \nsu\ufb00ered issues with her pregnancy, and an elderly male who has su\ufb00ered from anxiety when eating food since the incident.\nPenny goes to  see a lawyer. As a result of the gastro, \nshe has su\ufb00ered ongoing health problems and has lost her job, due to  her time o\ufb00 work. Penny\u2019s lawyer tells \nher that she has a good case and that he is happy to  \nhelp her issue a claim in court at a fee  of $350 per hour. \nHe estimates that Penny will need to  pay $45 000 in \nlegal fees, for  him and a barrister, for  Penny to  take the \nmatter to  trial. Penny doesn\u2019t have  that sort of money \nsaved. She\u2019s also concerned because she\u2019s recently heard that the local restaurant has gone out of business, and nobody knows where the owner is.  However, she has \nbeen told that both Snailed Bottles Pty Ltd  and Andrea \nMcChock\u2019s businesses are  thriving. She has also been \ntold that Andrea doesn\u2019t have  any assets in Australia \nand spends most of her time in New Jersey, USA.

It can institute proceedings against businesses in court if it has evidence that they have acted contrary to their legal obligations. For example, in 2017 CAV took action against various real estate agents for \u2018underquoting\u2019 properties to buyers (giving market estimates well below the price at which they ultimately sold). \nAppropriateness of Consumer Affairs Victoria\nNot all civil disputes can be resolved by CAV . CAV uses certain criteria to determine whether it is an appropriate dispute resolution body for a particular dispute. Three of those criteria are as follows:\n1 Whether the dispute is within CAV\u2019s jurisdiction.\n2 Whether the dispute is likely to settle.\n3 Whether there are other or better ways to resolve the dispute (that is, there is another alternative).In addition to the above criteria, CAV will not conciliate disputes that the courts or the Victorian \nCivil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) have already made a decision on, or disputes where there \nis a case pending (yet to be decided) in the courts or VCAT. It will also only accept complaints if the person complaining has \ufb01rst tried to resolve the dispute themselves, and if the complaint warrants CAV\u2019s involvement (for example, it is not a trivial complaint).\nWhether the dispute is within Consumer Affairs Victoria\u2019s \njurisdiction\nCAV is limited to assisting in the settlement of disputes that are within its jurisdiction.

  "Page 217": "205  CHAPTER  7 RESOLVING  A CIVIL DISPUTEWhether the dispute is likely to  settle\nCAV  will help resolve a dispute if there is a reasonable likelihood that the dispute will settle. The  following \nfactors may  be taken into consideration to  determine whether the dispute may  settle:\n\u2022 there has been no delay in the person complaining/uni00A0to/uni00A0CAV\n\u2022 CA V\u2019s database of complaints does not show that the other party has previously refused to  participate \nin conciliation\n\u2022 the person complaining has not contributed to  the dispute through inappropriate behaviour\n\u2022 the dispute is not overly  subjective (e.g. where the consumer has complained about services which are  \npersonal in nature, such as hairdressing, because this would call for  opinions about whether something \nas personal as a haircut was  \u2018good\u2019 or/uni00A0not)\n\u2022 the trader hasn\u2019t already made a reasonable o\ufb00er that was  rejected by  the consumer.\nIf none of these factors are  present, CAV  may  consider the matter likely to  settle.\nAhmad and his landlord\nAhmad rents a  house in Essendon from Lachlan. He has been renting the property for  more than \ntwo years now, and he hasn\u2019t had many problems with the landlord.\nRecently, the house has developed foundation problems. The walls are  cracking, the pipes have \nburst, and Ahmad now  has no  hot water.  He has contacted Lachlan to  ask him to  repair the house, \nbut Lachlan has told  Ahmad he\u2019s short of money, so if Ahmad wants  the house repaired, he will \nneed to  pay for it himself.\nLachlan owns at  least  10 other rental properties in  Victoria. CAV\u2019s  database shows that Lachlan \nhas been the subject of complaints in the past from tenants, and has refused every  attempt in the \npast by tenants to  try to  resolve disputes with him through/uni00A0CAV.EXAMPLE\nOther or better ways to  resolve the dispute\nThe parties will need to  consider whether there are  other or better ways  to resolve the dispute. Other than \ndetermining whether the dispute is within CAV\u2019s jurisdiction, and whether the matter is likely to  settle, \nother matters that the parties need to  consider include:\n\u2022 whether they will be able to,  or have  tried to,  resolve the dispute themselves (e.g. through negotiation)\n\u2022 whether the dispute is best resolved by  a court or tribunal making a binding order on the parties, \nrather than reaching a resolution themselves\n\u2022 whether the other party is unlikely to  take  the conciliation process seriously, or may  not show up,  so \nissuing a claim in a court or tribunal is more likely to  force them into realising the seriousness of the \ndispute\n\u2022 whether one party would prefer the formality of the tribunal or court processes to  resolve the dispute\n\u2022 whether the matter is too  big or complex to  be appropriate for/uni00A0CAV\n\u2022 whether resolution of the matter is urgent, so  a court is a better option (e.g. an order to  stop a trader \nselling a car to  someone else).When you are \nanswering a question about CAV  conciliation \nservices, remember that these government agencies are not courts or tribunals.

Parties may be more likely to accept an outcome if it has not been imposed or forced on/uni00A0them.\nIf you are asked to \nevaluate CAV, you should link each of the strengths and weaknesses to one or more of the principles of justice.

CAV will also normally refer a matter which is only \npartly in its area, and partly in another body\u2019s area, to that other body. This narrows the range of disputes it covers even further.\n\u2022 CA V has no power to compel parties to undergo conciliation. A/uni00A0willing party to a dispute may \nnot be able to use CAV\u2019s dispute resolution services if the other party is not also willing.\n\u2022 CA V also has no powers to enforce any decisions reached by the parties in conciliation. Unless the \nparties have entered into a binding agreement at conciliation, then one of the parties may just ignore the outcome. This can leave the parties no better o\ufb00 than they were before conciliation.\n\u2022 Not all cases are accepted by CAV . This is because of CAV\u2019s criteria and its prioritisation of cases. \n\u2022 T he informal nature of the conciliation process, and lack of a binding decision, may mean that one or \nmore parties may fail to take the matter seriously.\n\u2022 CAV is not appropriate for large and complex disagreements, including those with di\ufb03cult legal \nquestions or several di\ufb00erent parties, which can only be resolved by a court or tribunal which has greater expertise in the/uni00A0law.\n07_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   206 10/10/2017   11:33 AM",

  "Page 220": "208 UNIT  3 RIGHTS AND JUSTICE7.2 THE VICTORIAN CIVIL AND \nADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL\nThe Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) is a tribunal (rather than a court). Tribunals are \ndispute resolution bodies which deal with a limited area of law, and build up expertise in that area. The process of dispute resolution is less formal than the courts, and is intended to be a cheaper and more e\ufb03cient way of resolving disputes.\nEstablished in 1998, when the Victorian Parliament passed the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal \nAct 1998 (Vic), VCAT hears and determines a range of civil and administrative cases in Victoria. VCAT is one of Australia\u2019s busiest tribunals, receiving more than 85 000 claims per/uni00A0year.\nStructure of the Victorian Civil and Administrative \nTribunal\nThe governing body of VCAT consists of the President, a number of vice-presidents, deputy presidents, \nsenior members and ordinary members. The President is a judge of the Supreme Court, and vice-\npresidents are judges of the County Court. They are responsible for the management and administration of/uni00A0VCAT.\nVCAT is divided into four divisions. Each contains one or more lists, which hears certain types of \ndisputes. The divisions and lists as of 2017 are shown in Source 1/uni00A0below.\nDIVISION TYPES OF DISPUTES LISTS\nAdministrative Deals with professional conduct inquiries and applications from \npeople seeking a review of decisions made by government and \nother authorities.\u2022 Legal Practice\u2022 Planning and Environment\u2022 Review and Regulation\nCivil Deals with a range of civil disputes relating to consumer matters, domestic building works, owners\u2019 corporation matters, retail tenancies, sale and ownership of property, and use or flow of water between properties.\u2022 Civil/uni00A0Claims\u2022 Building and Property\u2022 Owners Corporations\nHuman Rights Deals with matters relating to guardianship and administration, \nequal opportunity, racial and religious vilification, health and privacy information, disability matters and decisions made by the Mental Health Tribunal.\u2022 Guardianship\u2022 Human Rights\nResidential TenanciesDeals with tenancy disputes, including disputes between residential tenants and landlords, rooming house owners and residents, caravan park owners and residents, and site tenants and owners.\u2022 Residential Tenanciesmember \nthe person who presides over final hearings and compulsory conferences at VCAT.

The three most popular lists appear in Source 2 below. These cases made up 89 per cent of the cases lodged with VCAT. Residential tenancies disputes (disputes between landlords and tenants) alone made up more than 65 per cent of claims filed with/uni00A0VCAT.\nSource 2 Most popular lists at VCAT in the financial year 2015\u201316\nLow/uni00A0cost methods of resolving disputes\nVCAT provides a low-cost method of resolving disputes in a number of/uni00A0ways:\n\u2022 generally, the parties need only pay a small amount for \ufb01ling their claim, although costs vary from list \nto list. VCAT fees generally increase from year to year. Until 1 July 2018, the standard fee was $62.70 \nfor smaller claims. Y ou can access VCAT\u2019s website to get up to date information about/uni00A0fees\n\u2022 fr om 1 July 2016, VCAT changed its fee structure to create three tiers or levels of fees:/uni00A0corporate \n(businesses with a turnover of more than $200 000 per year and government agencies), standard (individuals and small businesses) and health care card holders. The aim of this was to make corporate applicants pay higher fees, and to make those who are less able to pay (being health care card holders) pay only nominal fees (or for some type of disputes, no/uni00A0fee)\n\u2022 ther e are no hearing fees for some claims, such as small civil claims (e.g. a claim of less than \n$15 000); however, for other disputes a hearing fee is payable\n\u2022 in many lists, the parties do not have to go through pre-trial procedures which can often add to the legal costs incurred by the parties. Y ou will study court pre-trial procedures in the next/uni00A0topic\n\u2022 co sts are further reduced because the parties can represent themselves, rather than paying lawyers. \nMore than 80 per cent of people represent themselves at VCAT. In some situations, VCAT may not allow a person to be legally represented, particularly where the other party is not represented.\nThere has been a decline in the number of civil claims lodged in the Civil Claims List with VCAT since \na fee rise in 2013. Further fee changes were made in July 2016. They included additional hearing fees for \nsome matters, as well as creating a three-tiered system of charging/uni00A0fees.\nThe accessibility of the Victorian Civil and Administrative \nTribunal\nVCAT conducts hearings in various locations in Victoria. Its main centre is in Melbourne, but it has a \nnumber of venues across the state.

  "Page 222": "210 UNIT  3 RIGHTS AND JUSTICEEfficiency of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal\nVCAT constantly aims to reduce waiting times. Reducing the \nwaiting time for parties to have their disputes resolved makes the process more e\ufb03cient. The average time for a case to be \ufb01nalised in VCAT varies from list to list. In 2015\u201316, the Civil Claims List had a median wait time of 10/uni00A0 weeks, while the Residential Tenancies List had a median wait time of 2 weeks. The Planning and Environment List, however, had a median wait time of around 6/uni00A0 months. Information about current estimated waiting time is available on VCAT\u2019s website.\nVCAT has also recently focused on technology and upgraded \nits computer systems to ensure greater e\ufb03ciency in handling claims.\nIndependence of the Victorian Civil and Administrative \nTribunal\nVCAT\u2019s members are independent, and will act as unbiased adjudicators. VCAT is also supported by Court \nServices Victoria (CSV), established in 2014. CSV is independent of parliament and government.\nDispute resolution methods used at the Victorian \nCivil and Administrative Tribunal\nVCAT uses three main types of dispute resolution methods:\n\u2022 mediation, including a SMAH process for small civil/uni00A0claims\n\u2022 compulsory conferences\u2022 a \ufb01nal hearing before a member.\nMediation \nMediation is a cooperative method of resolving disputes. It is a tightly structured, joint problem-solving \nprocess in which the parties discuss the issues involved, develop options, consider alternatives and reach an agreement through negotiation. Parties may bring support people or legal representatives with them.\nThe parties attempt to reach an agreement with the help of a mediator. A/uni00A0 mediator does not \ninterfere, but allows the parties to have control of their dispute, explore the options and attempt to reach an agreement that satis\ufb01es the needs of both parties. The role of the mediator is to aid discussion between the disputing parties, and ensure that both parties are being heard. The mediator does not need to be an expert in the \ufb01eld of the dispute, but does need to possess a high level of con\ufb02ict resolution skills. They will not make decisions about whether there has been a breach of the law, and will not o\ufb00er legal advice.\nAlthough mediation is not legally binding, in most situations a deed or terms of settlement is drawn \nup once the parties reach a resolution. The deed of settlement is then enforceable through the courts if Source 3 VCAT\u2019s main office at \n55/uni00A0King Street, MelbourneCourt Services Victoria (CSV)  an independent body that provides services and facilities to Victoria\u2019s courts and the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal\nparliament \na formal assembly of representatives of the people that is elected by the people and gathers together to make laws\ngovernment \nthe ruling authority with power to govern, formed by the political party that holds the majority in the lower house in each parliament.

In some situations, VCAT may make an order which gives e\ufb00ect \nto the terms of settlement, so that the terms will become a formal order of the tribunal and be binding.\nMost disputes at VCAT will go to mediation before a \ufb01nal hearing. If the matter settles at mediation, \nthen there is no need for a hearing.\nShort mediation and hearing\nDisputes about goods and services in the Civil Claims List valued at less than $3000 may be listed for a short mediation and hearing (SMAH). A/uni00A0quali\ufb01ed VCAT sta\ufb00 mediator conducts the mediation. If the dispute does not settle at mediation, then the matter will go straight to hearing on the same day before a di\ufb00erent VCAT member. In the \ufb01nancial year 2015\u201316, about half of the cases that went to mediation as part of the SMAH process settled.\nCompulsory conferences\nCompulsory conferences are con\ufb01dential meetings during which the parties discuss ways to resolve their dispute in the presence of a VCAT member.\nCompulsory conferences use a conciliation process. The VCAT member who assists in the process \nmay suggest forms of settlement, and may explore the likely outcomes of the case if it goes to a hearing. That is, a member may give a view as to the possible decision that may be reached at hearing. The VCAT member who assists in the compulsory conference generally will not hear the case at the \ufb01nal hearing, and will not tell the member presiding over the hearing what happened at the compulsory conference.\nFinal hearing\nIf the matter has not settled at mediation, compulsory conference or in any other way, then it will be listed for a \ufb01nal hearing before a VCAT member. At the hearing, the parties will be given an opportunity to present their case, which will include giving and hearing evidence, asking questions of witnesses and providing documents which support their case.

Often the parties will have no \nchoice but to bring their disputes to VCAT, because it has exclusive jurisdiction to hear certain types of claims. Exclusive jurisdiction means that only VCAT has the power to hear and determine that type of dispute, and not a court. \nWhere VCAT does not have exclusive jurisdiction, parties can use VCAT or another dispute resolution \nbody such as a court.\nThe types of claims that can be heard by VCAT include claims/uni00A0about:\n\u2022 pur chases or sales of goods and services (unlike CAV , VCAT accepts claims made by sellers and \nbusinesses as well as purchasers)\n\u2022 disput es between tenants and landlords relating to renting a house, unit or \ufb02at, a room in a rooming \nhouse or a site or a caravan in a caravan/uni00A0park\n\u2022 o wners\u2019 corporations (bodies which manage the shared or common property of a property)\n\u2022 discrimination, sexual harassment, victimisation or vili\ufb01cation\n\u2022 domestic building/uni00A0works\u2022 lawyers, lawyers\u2019 conduct and the provision of legal services\u2022 the \ufb02ow of water between properties\u2022 retail tenancies\u2022 the use or development of land, including objections in relation to permits granted for use of/uni00A0land.\nVCAT also has a review jurisdiction to revisit decisions made by certain authorities. This means it \ncan a\ufb03rm, vary or set aside the decision made. This jurisdiction was used to determine the application \nmade by Bendigo residents about the granting of the permit to build a mosque in Bendigo.\nDisputes that VCAT cannot/uni00A0hear\nThere are a number of disputes that VCAT cannot hear, and so it will not be an appropriate body to resolve these types of disputes. Examples include:\n\u2022 representative proceedings (class actions)\u2022 disputes between employers and employees\u2022 disputes between neighbours (unless it is also a dispute about an owners\u2019 corporation)exclusive jurisdiction \nthe lawful authority or power of a court, tribunal or other dispute resolution body to decide legal cases to the exclusion of all others \nreview jurisdiction \nthe power of a body to consider a decision made by an agency or authority in order to either confirm, change or set aside (i.e./uni00A0overturn) that decision\n07_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   214 10/10/2017   11:34 AM",

Zoran Ivanovic was compensated with 3000 frequent flyer points, but he was not satisfied.\nThe VCAT member dismissed the claim. VCAT held that it did not have \nfederal jurisdiction that would allow it to hear and determine a claim such as this, because the flight was an international flight and the ticket was subject to international rules. VCAT therefore found that any claim by Ivanovic needed to be brought in a court which had federal jurisdiction, and \nVCAT did not have jurisdiction in this particular instance.LEGAL \nCASE\nSource 1 What happens when your \ninflight entertainment system doesn\u2019t work and you\u2019ve paid money to use/uni00A0it?\nOther or better ways to/uni00A0resolve disputes\nThe parties will need to consider whether there are other or better ways to resolve the dispute. Other than \ndetermining whether the dispute is within VCAT\u2019s jurisdiction, parties should also consider:\n\u2022 whether the parties are able to resolve the dispute themselves through negotiation or mediation\u2022 the nature of the fees (for some lists, the fees are just as high as court fees, or even higher)\u2022 whether the parties wish to have greater avenues of appeal (appeals from VCAT decisions are limited \nto appeals on a question of/uni00A0law)\n\u2022 whether one or more of the parties are unlikely to take VCAT seriously, and so a court is a preferred dispute resolution/uni00A0body\n\u2022 whether one or more of the parties would prefer the formality of the courtroom\n\u2022 whether the matter is of a complexity or size that is not appropriate for/uni00A0VCAT\u2022 whether the party prefers the court to resolve the dispute because of the doctrine of precedent. \nVCAT is not a court, and it cannot make new law:/uni00A0it can only apply law made by parliament or the courts. Its own decisions are not binding on anyone. This means the parties may have no certainty that VCAT will decide their case in the same way as in a previous/uni00A0case.\nStrengths and weaknesses of the Victorian Civil \nand Administrative Tribunal\nWhen you are considering the appropriateness of VCAT for a particular case, and assessing the extent to \nwhich it helps the civil justice system achieve the principles of justice, you should consider its strengths and weaknesses.doctrine of precedent \nthe common law principle by which the reasons for the decisions of higher courts are binding on courts ranked lower in the same hierarchy in cases where the material facts are similar\n07_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   215 10/10/2017   11:34 AM",

The VCAT member, in their \nfinal judgment, made reference to the role of VCAT in ensuring that both fairness and equality are upheld when a party is not represented. Below is an extract of the member\u2019s judgment:\n1 The applicant in this matter appeared without representation.\n2 The Tribunal is required to ensure that parties are provided with procedural fairness \nand equality before the/uni00A0law.\n3 Where one party is represented and the other is not, it may be necessary during a \nhearing to provide an unrepresented party with explanation or direction about the processes and procedures of the Tribunal. This cannot be an intervention in the form of advice or guidance in the substance or conduct of the case, and may not put the unrepresented person in a position of advantage.LEGAL \nCASEStrengths\nVCAT has a number of strengths in resolving disputes:\n\u2022 V CAT is normally cheaper than courts due to low application fees, usually lower hearing fees, \nthe costs saved by not having to undertake expensive pre-trial procedures and parties being able to \nrepresent themselves\n\u2022 it generally o\ufb00ers a speedy resolution of disputes \u2013 the average time from application to resolution \nof disputes in its busiest list, the Residential Tenancies List, is approximately two/uni00A0weeks\n\u2022 an informal atmosphere ensures that parties can put their case forward in their own way, which can \nmake people feel more comfortable with the process\n\u2022 the \ufb02exibility of VCAT\u2019s hearing processes ensure fairness and equality for an unrepresented \nparty, because the member can aim to ensure an unrepresented party has an equal opportunity to understand processes and present their case\n\u2022 eac h list operates in its own specialised jurisdiction, resulting in tribunal personnel developing \nexpertise in resolving disputes in that area/uni00A0of/uni00A0law\n\u2022 par ties are encouraged to reach a resolution between themselves, and often VCAT will refer \nmatters to mediation or a compulsory conference before the matter is determined by a \ufb01nal hearing. This saves costs and time, making it more accessible to the parties.\n\u2022 smaller claims bene\ufb01t from the more streamlined process (court cases have more steps, which can often be complex, time-consuming and expensive)\n\u2022 a decision made in a \ufb01nal hearing is binding on the parties, which means it is enforceable (unlike a decision that may have been reached by the parties themselves).\nBelow is an example of VCAT\u2019s processes ensuring unrepresented parties are treated fairly and equally.\nFor each of the \nstrengths and weaknesses of VCAT you should identify the principle(s) of justice that it most aligns/uni00A0to.Study/uni00A0tipWeaknesses \nVCAT has a number of weaknesses to consider:\n\u2022 due to increased use of legal representation, the costs of taking a matter to VCAT can often be as \nhigh as, if not higher than, court costs.

They  \nset out and clarify the claims and the defences of the parties and help to  de\ufb01ne the issues that are  in \ndispute. The  two main documents exchanged during the pleadings stage/uni00A0are:\n\u2022 a statement of claim, which is \ufb01led with the court by  the plainti\ufb00, and served (formally given) to  \nthe defendant. It sets out in detail the claims made against the defendant and the remedy sought by  \nthe plainti\ufb00. For  example, if the plainti\ufb00 makes a claim that the defendant has breached a contract, \nthen the statement of claim will set out (in paragraph form) what the contract was,  how  the defendant \nbreached it, and what loss the plainti\ufb00 su\ufb00ered because of the/uni00A0breach\n\u2022 a defence, which is \ufb01led by  the defendant. It s ets out the defendant\u2019s response to  each of the plainti\ufb00\u2019s \nclaims. In the above  example, the defendant may  (in the defence) admit that there was  a contract, but \nmay deny that he or she has breached that contract. \nIn general, if claims and defences are  not included in the parties\u2019 pleadings, they cannot make new \nclaims and raise new defences later in court, except with the leave (permission) of the court or with the consent of the other/uni00A0party.\nPurposes of/uni00A0pleadings\nThe purposes of pleadings are/uni00A0to:\n\u2022 require the parties to  state  the main claims and defences of their case.

For  example, if a claim or defence \nis so compelling, it might force the other party to  pursue a strategy to  settle the claim before/uni00A0trial.\nThe purposes of pleadings are  highlighted in Former Chief Justice Mason and Justice Gaudron\u2019s \nstatement in the case below.Source 2 The two main documents exchanged during the \npleadings/uni00A0stage.\nThe purposes of pleadings\nBanque Commerciale SA, En liquidation v Akhil Holdings Pty Ltd (1991) 69 \nCLR/uni00A0279\nIn the High Court case of Banque Commerciale SA,  En liquidation v  Akhil Holdings Pty Ltd , Chief \nJustice Mason and Justice Gaudron stated as follows about the purpose of pleadings:\nThe function of  pleadings is to  state  with sufficient clarity the case that must be  met:/uni00A0 Gould \nand Birbeck and Bacon v/uni00A0Mount Oxide Mines Ltd  (in liq) (1916) 22 CLR 490 per Isaacs and \nRich JJ at 517. In this way,  pleadings serve to  ensure the basic requirement of procedural \nfairness that a  party should have the opportunity of meeting the case against him or \nher and, incidentally, to  define the issues for  decision.

For example:\n\u2022 if  the plainti\ufb00 claims that there is a written contract, you  would expect that the plainti\ufb00 will have  a \ncopy of that contract\n\u2022 if  the plainti\ufb00 claims to  have  su\ufb00ered physical injuries, you  would expect there to  be medical records \nwhich show the nature and extent of the injuries\n\u2022 if  the plainti\ufb00 claims to  have  su\ufb00ered loss because of payment of medical expenses, then they should \nbe able to  show invoices and receipts of those medical expenses\n\u2022 if  the plainti\ufb00 claims to  have  su\ufb00ered abuse  and humiliation in a workplace because of emails being \nsent around, those emails must be made available for  the other/uni00A0side.\nThis is very  di\ufb00erent from what is often portrayed in TV shows, where a party may  for the \ufb01rst time \nat trial \u2018reveal\u2019 a document or put to  a witness a document that the other party has never seen. Instead, \nthe parties will have  a copy of each other\u2019s documents before trial, and there is now  an obligation on the \nparties to  disclose the existence of critical documents at  the earliest reasonable/uni00A0time.Plaintiff DefendantStatement of Claim \nDefence \nThe word \u2018document\u2019 is \ngiven a broad definition and means any record of information.

Approximately 4/uni00A0million electronic documents had been scanned by the plaintiff, which it estimated could be reduced to 1 400 000 as potentially being relevant. Justice Vickery found that the cost of manually reviewing 4/uni00A0 million or even 1.4/uni00A0 million documents was unrealistic, as it would take over 583 working weeks for one junior solicitor to review/uni00A0them.\nJustice Vickery ordered that the use of predictive coding technology, or Technology Assisted \nReview, was appropriate in this case for the purposes of discovery. Predictive coding technology would involve the use of computer software which would be \u2018trained\u2019 to review documents and identify those that are relevant.\nHis Honour referred to overseas cases which \nhad recently approved the use of such technology, noting that the use of technology is just as accurate as, and probably more accurate than, a person manually reviewing documents.\nFollowing the decision in this case, the Supreme \nCourt issued new guidelines for technology on 30 January 2017 which state that in larger cases, Technology Assisted Review will be an accepted method of conducting searches of documents for \nthe purposes of completing discovery.LEGAL \nCASE\nSource 3 When it comes to discovery, will \ntechnology replace much of the role of lawyers in the future?\nPurposes of/uni00A0discovery \nThe purpose of the discovery stage/uni00A0is/uni00A0to:\n\u2022 require the parties to disclose or reveal all relevant documents to the other side so that all parties \nhave access to the documents, ensuring fairness in the process\n\u2022 reduce the element of surprise at trial and avoid a \u2018trial by ambush\u2019 , since the parties have seen \nthe relevant documents well in advance at trial and have had time to prepare their arguments\n\u2022 allo w each party to determine the strength of the other side\u2019s case and their own likelihood of \nsuccess\n\u2022 ensur e that the parties and the court have all the relevant material and documents required to \nachieve a just outcome (some of the documents will then be submitted in evidence to support a \nparty\u2019s/uni00A0case)\n\u2022 assist in reaching an out-of-court settlement where appropriate.

  "Page 233": "221  CHAPTER  7 RESOLVING A CIVIL DISPUTEExchange of/uni00A0evidence\nTo prove their case, the plainti\ufb00 and defendant will generally \nneed to rely on evidence. This is particularly the case where the documents are unable to speak for themselves.\nFor example, imagine a breach of contract case where the \nplainti\ufb00 has listed in discovery a contract with alterations in pen, marked with the initials \u2018LJ\u2019 . Either party may wish to rely on oral evidence as to who crossed out the contract, and who initialled it, unless they are able to agree on that fact, as the contract itself may not give that information.\nThere are generally two types of evidence:/uni00A0lay evidence and expert evidence.\nLay evidence\nLaypersons or ordinary people give lay evidence. They do not give evidence about their opinion or expertise about a matter, but rather about what they know about the factual circumstances. \nThe type of evidence from laypersons will depend on the case. For example, in a negligence case \nin which the plainti\ufb00 alleges she slipped and fell on some oil left by the defendant outside her shop, the plainti\ufb00 may rely on evidence given by a layperson who saw the plainti\ufb00 falling.\nDepending on what the court has ordered, laypersons might give evidence as follows:\n\u2022 as a witness outline \u2013 An outline is a brief description of the topics the witness will give evidence on when they attend trial. The outline allows the other parties to know in advance what the evidence will be about.\n\u2022 by \ufb01ling a witness statement \u2013 A/uni00A0witness statement is the written form of evidence that the witness \nwould have given orally. A/uni00A0witness who provides a witness statement may only need to attend trial for cross-examination (that is, being questioned by the other party) and re-examination (that is, being questioned by the party that called that witness following cross-examination).\n\u2022 orally (also known as giving viva voce evidence) \u2013 The witness will need to attend trial and will be asked questions under oath or a\ufb03rmation. They will not have to provide a witness outline or statement before giving that evidence. This is the traditional way of giving evidence at trial.\nThere are three types of examination of witnesses. The \ufb01rst is examination-in-chief, which is a \nseries of questions put to the witness by the party that has called that witness. This is followed by cross-\nexamination, which is where the other party questions that witness (and tries to point to holes in their evidence), and re-examination (which is where the party calling the witness tries to clarify anything put to the witness during cross-examination).\nExpert evidence\nExperts are often called by parties in a civil claim to give an opinion about an issue in the case. Depending on the nature of the/uni00A0case, the person may have expertise in a particular \ufb01eld such as medicine, accountancy, \ufb01nance, engineering or law.\nExpert evidence is often submitted through a written report by an independent expert. Experts must \nonly give an opinion within their area of expertise. Experts, even though engaged by a party, are under oath and have a primary duty to the court. That means they cannot argue the case for the party, but instead must give an opinion within their area of expertise, even if it means that it is not helpful for the party he or she is engaged by. They must ensure they remain independent and help the court resolve the issues in dispute.\nExpert evidence is often given in cases involving personal or mental harm (where a medical professional \nmay give evidence about the nature and extent of injury), and in cases involving loss or damage (where an expert may be asked to give an assessment of the amount of loss su\ufb00ered).lay evidence \nevidence given by a layperson (i.e. an ordinary person) about the facts in dispute\nexpert evidence \nstatements of fact given by an independent expert about an area within his or her expertiseLay\nevidenceLayperson\n(non-expert)Evidence about\nwhat happened\nExpert\nevidenceIndependent\nexpertOpinion evidence\nin area of\nexpertise\nSource 4 Types of evidence\nFor your assessment tasks, you need to know the purposes of pre-trial procedures, and you must explain those purposes using examples.

This means they are  graded or \nranked in order of the complexity and severity of  \ncases that they hear. The  Magistrates\u2019 Court is at  the \nbottom of the hierarchy and deals with less-serious issues. The  Supreme Court of Victoria is the highest \nVictorian/uni00A0court.\nThe High Court is a federal court. It can hear \nappeals from the Court of Appeal, but a/uni00A0party must \ufb01rst get  the High Court\u2019s leave (consent) to  appeal.\nTwo of the main reasons for  a court hierarchy \nin the resolution of civil disputes are to ensure \nadministrative convenience, and to  allow appeals.\nSource 1 The Victorian court hierarchy\nStudy/uni00A0tip\nThe VCE Legal Studies \nStudy Design requires you to know these two \nreasons (administrative convenience and appeals) for a court hierarchy in determining civil cases. These two reasons are different to  those that \nyou need to  know for \nUnit 3 \u2013 Area of Study 1 in relation to  the \ncriminal justice system,  \nwhich are specialisation and appeals. Make sure you remember which \ntwo reasons you need \nto know for each Area \nof Study.

Less serious and less complex cases are  heard in lower courts, while more serious and more \ncomplex cases are  heard in the higher courts.\nMinor civil disputes (claims where the plainti\ufb00 is seeking less than $100 000)/uni00A0can be heard in the \nMagistrates\u2019 Court. These cases can be heard quickly and less expensively in the Magistrates\u2019 Court. \nBecause there are  a signi\ufb01cant number of smaller disputes in Victoria, there are  a greater number of  \nmagistrates, and there are  more Magistrates\u2019 Courts across the state.  If smaller claims had to  be heard in \nthe higher courts along with larger claims, then they would take  longer to/uni00A0hear.\nThe more serious and complex civil disputes are  heard in the County Court and the Supreme Court, \nwhich have  an unlimited jurisdiction. Class actions (representative proceedings) are  normally large and \ncomplex, and these are  heard only in the Supreme Court. They  take  longer to  hear and require judges \nwho are  experts in complicated points of  law. By being part of a court hierarchy, the County and Supreme \nCourts can more easily manage the allocation of time for  the longer, more complicated/uni00A0cases.\nAppeals\nSomeone who is dissatis\ufb01ed with a decision in a civil trial can, if there are  grounds for  appeal, take  the \nmatter to  a higher/uni00A0court.\nGrounds for  appeal in a civil case can include:\n\u2022 a point of  law (also known as a question of/uni00A0law) \u2013  where some law  has not been followed; for  example, \nthe court was  allowed to  hear inadmissible evidence\n\u2022 a question of/uni00A0fact \u2013 whether the facts of the case had been applied appropriately to  reach the decision\n\u2022 the remedy awarded \u2013 the way  in which a court enforced a right, or the order that was  made by   \nanother court.High Court \nthe ultimate court of appeal in Australia and the court with the authority to  hear and \ndetermine disputes arising under the Australian Constitution\n07_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   224 10/10/2017   11:34 AM",

Therefore, having a court hierarchy ensures there is a system by which a \ndecision can be reviewed by a more superior court. \nMost civil disputes now require leave to appeal (i.e. nearly all appeals to the Court of Appeal, and all \nappeals to the High Court). Getting the court\u2019s consent to hear an appeal in a civil case will usually require the party to satisfy the court that there is a reasonable chance of success.\nBoth the Court of Appeal and the High Court can determine special leave applications \u2018on the papers\u2019 , \nwhich means that no formal hearing may be required.

The judge must not favour either side, and must be independent (i.e. have no connection with the parties). Where there is no jury to decide on the facts, the judge must make a decision on the facts as well as the law, and assess damages where necessary.\nResponsibilities of/uni00A0the/uni00A0judge\nThe judge must ensure that justice is upheld in a civil trial. This means ensuring that a trial is conducted fairly, equally, and with both parties having access to the procedures and mechanisms used at trial. The use of an independent and impartial judge ensures that the rule of law is upheld \u2013 that is, judges are independent of government and/uni00A0the parties.\nSome of the main responsibilities of a judge in a civil trial are as follows.\n\u2022 Manage the/uni00A0trial\nThe judge has signi\ufb01cant powers of case management to ensure the trial is conducted in a just, timely and e\ufb03cient manner. Generally, a trial will be conducted according to a set procedure (for example, the plainti\ufb00 will present the case, followed by the defendant), but the judge has the power to change this procedure.\nThe judge also has power to give directions and orders in the trial, ask a witness questions to clarify \nhis or her evidence, and hand down rulings throughout the trial where necessary. For example, there may be a need in the middle of trial to decide a point of law, such as whether a particular witness can give hearsay evidence. The judge may make a ruling in the middle of trial about whether this is allowed by the/uni00A0rules.\n\u2022 Decide on/uni00A0the admissibility of/uni00A0evidence\nLike a judge in a criminal trial, the judge in a civil trial is responsible for deciding which evidence is to be permitted under the rules, and can exclude evidence from the trial, thus ensuring fairness in the way evidence is allowed.\n\u2022 Attend to/uni00A0the jury (if/uni00A0there/uni00A0is/uni00A0one)\nIn most civil trials, there is no jury. However, if there is a jury, the judge may need to address the jury during trial, give directions to the jury, and sum up the case to the jury at the conclusion of/uni00A0trial.Source 1 Chief Justice \nSusan Kiefel of the High Court of Australia.

This means that the judge, not a jury, is the decider of/uni00A0facts.\nJudges will generally \u2018reserve\u2019 their decision and deliver it a later time. In doing so, they will \nnormally provide their written reasons for their decision. These written reasons, known as \u2018judgments\u2019 , should be delivered in a timely manner and in a way that is accessible and readable. What is timely will depend on the complexity of the case, but parties should not have to wait signi\ufb01cant months or years for judgment.\n\u2022 Make a decision on/uni00A0costs\nAfter each hearing in a civil case the judge will decide which party should bear the costs. The general rule is that working out the costs is left to the end, and the successful party is entitled to costs, but that is not always the/uni00A0case.\nThe scenario below is an example of costs in a dispute being decided at a later date.\nLawyer must pay police officer $150 000 over claim \nteenager Tyler Cassidy was \u2018executed\u2019\nMark Russell, The Age, 6 May/uni00A02016\nA police officer has been awarded $150 000 in damages after a Supreme Court jury found he \nhad been defamed by a lawyer who claimed he executed teenager Tyler Cassidy at a Northcote skate park in/uni00A02008.\nSupreme Court Justice Kevin Bell on Friday said he wanted to demonstrate to the world \nthat the defamatory online comments by Queensland barrister Michael McDonald \u2013 who claimed Sergeant Colin Dods should have been charged with manslaughter \u2013 were a \u2018baseless challenge\u2019 to the police officer\u2019s integrity and public standing.\nJustice Bell said Sergeant Dods deserved to keep his good name as a respected member \nof the community and as a/uni00A0police officer.IN \nTHE \nNEWSContractual dispute between a builder and a subcontractor\nA subcontractor sued a builder for $2/uni00A0million in damages in the Supreme Court of Victoria.

The subcontractor ignored the letter and pursued the dispute to/uni00A0trial.\nThe Supreme Court of Victoria found in favour of the subcontractor, but found that the damages \nthe subcontractor had suffered was only $500 000. Judgment was entered for the subcontractor for $500 000. The judge asked the parties to make submissions about costs, which would be decided at a later date. The builder made submissions that the subcontractor should not be entitled to any costs after the date of the letter, because the subcontractor would have been better off had it accepted the builder\u2019s offer of/uni00A0$1 million.EXAMPLE\nThe article below is an example of a jury determining liability and the judge deciding what remedy \nshould be awarded in a civil trial.judgment \na statement by the judge at the end of case that outlines the decision and the legal reasoning behind the decision\nliability legal responsibility for one\u2019s acts or omissions\n07_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   228 10/10/2017   11:34 AM",

Juries may be used in two situations:\n\u2022 either the plainti\ufb00 or the defendant can specify during the pleadings stage that they wish to have \nthe proceeding tried by a jury, though the court can still direct that the trial be without a jury if it decides a jury is not required. The party who wishes a civil dispute to be tried by a jury must pay the applicable/uni00A0fee\n\u2022 the court may order that a proceeding be tried with a jury, though this is/uni00A0rare.\nLike a criminal jury, the civil jury makes a decision about which facts it believes to be true. For example, \ndid an article written in a newspaper actually damage the reputation of the plainti\ufb00 in a civil case? Was it actually untrue? The jury must also apply the facts to the law as explained by the judge. The judge makes decisions on points of/uni00A0law.\nThe jury may also be required to assess damages. However, juries in defamation cases (cases which \ninvolve untrue statements made about a person which have damaged that person\u2019s reputation) no longer decide on the amount of damages.\nComposition of/uni00A0a civil/uni00A0jury\nIf a civil trial is to be tried by a jury, the jury is made up of only six jurors. The jurors are chosen randomly from persons eligible to vote and who are on the electoral roll, and following a lengthy selection process.\nResponsibilities of/uni00A0a civil/uni00A0jury\nMany of the responsibilities of a civil jury are the same as those in a criminal jury. The main ones are set out/uni00A0below.\n\u2022 Be objecti ve\nThe jury must be unbiased and bring an open mind to the task, putting aside any prejudices or preconceived ideas. Each juror (jury member) must have no connection with any of the parties, and must also be careful to decide on the facts, not on their own biases.\n\u2022 Listen to/uni00A0and remember the/uni00A0evidence\nAs you learnt in Chapter/uni00A04, evidence can be very complicated. For example, a case about a business valuation may include complicated He said a jury found Mr McDonald had defamed Sergeant Dods in \n2012 by claiming in online posts on a website that the police officer had executed Tyler; shot and killed Tyler without any adequate reason; had gunned down Tyler like he was a monster and dangerous mongrel dog; and had used excessive force out of proportion to any threat posed by/uni00A0Tyler.\nMr McDonald had also claimed Sergeant Dods chose to shoot \nTyler,/uni00A0a slightly built, inexperienced and partially blinded boy [after being capsicum sprayed], six times when he knew he and other police could have overpowered Tyler without anybody being harmed; and by shooting Tyler he had committed manslaughter.\nJustice Bell described the defamatory comments as \u2018very grave\u2019.\nCivil juries are far less \ncommon than criminal juries. In 2014\u201315 there were 93 civil jury trials in the County and Supreme Courts, compared with 523 criminal jury trials in the same period.Did you/uni00A0know?\nIn a civil trial, the court can order the empanelment of up to two additional jurors, so that there may be up to eight jurors. However, when it comes to the jury reaching its verdict, only six jurors will be required.Did you/uni00A0know?Source 2 Sergeant Dods was awarded damages in his civil dispute.\nSource 3 A civil jury will only have six jurors\n07_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   229 10/10/2017   11:34 AM",

  "Page 243": "231  CHAPTER  7 RESOLVING A CIVIL DISPUTETHE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PARTIES \nAND LEGAL PRACTITIONERS IN A CIVIL TRIAL7.7 \nIn addition to the judge and the jury, the parties and the legal practitioners also have responsibilities in a \ncivil/uni00A0trial.\nThe parties\nThe main parties in a civil trial are the plainti\ufb00 and the defendant. As discussed in Chapter/uni00A06, there can be more than one plainti\ufb00 and defendant, and in representative proceedings, the lead plainti\ufb00 will represent the group members.\nThe trial system in Victoria operates such that each party controls its own case and has complete \ncontrol over decisions about how the case will be run, as long as the rules of evidence and procedure are followed. This is known as \u2018party control\u2019 . This is di\ufb00erent from a system with an external investigator who seeks out the truth to determine liability.\nThe Civil Procedure Act 2010 (Vic) was introduced in Victoria to reform and modernise the laws and \nprocesses relating to civil proceedings in courts, as well as to impose some overarching obligations on the parties and their legal practitioners. These obligations are designed to improve standards of conduct. They include a duty to act honestly and to cooperate in the conduct of the proceeding.\n\u2192 GOING FURTHER\nThe trial system in Australia is often called the adversary system. In this type of system two parties (or adversaries) \u2018battle\u2019 each other to win \u2013 much like a duel or a football match. The parties are responsible for deciding how to present their case as they attempt to win.\nA different type of system is the \u2018inquisitorial system\u2019, used in some European countries, which \ninvolves the judge playing an investigative role in deciding the winner or loser. Parties have less control over the conduct of the case. \nAlthough there are generally two types of systems, they share some features. Many parts \nof our adversary system are not \u2018adversarial\u2019, and the trend is towards using less adversarial processes overall.\nResponsibilities of/uni00A0the parties\nThe plainti\ufb00 has the speci\ufb01c responsibility of proving the facts of the case, given that he or she has the burden of proof. The defendant will have to show that the defence gives a good answer to the claim. A/uni00A0defendant who has \ufb01led a counterclaim will have to prove the claims it makes. The facts will need to be established on the balance of probabilities.\nThe parties have a number of other responsibilities in a civil trial. The main responsibilities are set \nout/uni00A0below.\n\u2022 Make opening and closing addresses\nBoth parties will give an opening and closing address, which will outline and summarise the case for the party. The general procedural rules are that the plainti\ufb00 will present their case \ufb01rst, and then the defendant will present their case. However, the judge can require something di\ufb00erent from these general procedural/uni00A0rules.lead plainti\ufb00 \nthe person named as the plaintiff on behalf of the group members in a representative proceeding (i.e. class action)\nparty control \neach party in a civil trial has control over the way the case will/uni00A0run\nburden of proof \nthe obligation (i.e. responsibility) of a party to prove a case.

  "Page 244": "232 UNIT  3 RIGHTS AND JUSTICE\u2022 Present the/uni00A0case to/uni00A0the judge or/uni00A0jury\nThe parties will present their case to the judge or jury (if there \nis one). Most of the trial is taken up with presenting their case through lay witnesses and expert witnesses. Each witness may give evidence orally, and may be examined about his or her evidence.\n\u2022 Comply with/uni00A0overarching obligations\nThere are 10 overarching obligations under the Civil Procedure Act. They include the obligations to use reasonable endeavours \nto resolve disputes, disclose the existence of critical documents at the earliest reasonable time, and act in a way that minimises delay and does not mislead or deceive anyone in relation to the dispute. The parties must comply with these obligations during and before trial. \nLegal practitioners\nLegal practitioners on behalf of the parties usually undertake the role of preparing and conducting a case. This representation is often necessary in a civil trial, because the legal practitioners are experts who are familiar with civil trials. These experts help to ensure that the parties are able to present their best possible case, and to assist in achieving a just outcome. They are also the ones to ensure that the rule of law is upheld, and that the law is applied equally and fairly.\nIt is di\ufb03cult for a party to present their own case in a civil trial \nwithout legal representation. They may not know how to present their evidence in the most e\ufb00ective way, or may not know how to cross-examine a witness. They may also be too emotionally invested in the case to be able to make objective decisions about the way they argue their case. Bringing out the truth and showing your case in the best light depends on a party being legally represented, with the best lawyer possible. The truth should emerge through each party presenting their own case to the best of their ability and the other side showing the \ufb02aws in the legal arguments and the evidence being presented (for example, by cross-examining the witnesses). If one party is better represented than the other, this could lead to an unfair advantage and possibly an incorrect outcome. A/uni00A0person who is represented by a competent barrister has a better chance of winning than a person whose barrister is less experienced. A/uni00A0competent barrister has greater skill at preparing a case and bringing out the desired evidence.\nLegal practitioners have special duties and obligations \nimposed by statute. Their most important duty is the duty to the court and the administration of justice. They cannot mislead or deceive the court, cannot place incorrect facts before the court, and they must be honest about cases they use in argument Source 1 The 10 overarching obligations under the Civil \nProcedure Act. The parties and their legal practitioners need to comply with them in any civil proceeding.\nSource 2 The Victorian WorkCover Authority is sometimes a \nparty to a civil dispute when a workplace injury is involved.

Parties may also attend more than one mediation if there is a prospect that a further mediation may help settle the dispute.associate judge \na judicial officer of the Supreme Court of Victoria who has power to make orders and give directions during the pre-trial stage of a proceeding.

Often with the assistance of a mediator, the parties may realise that there is a bene\ufb01t to settling \nthe dispute early and before trial, without spending the costs of going to trial.\nMost if not all civil proceedings in the Supreme Court go to mediation before trial, and mediation is \nconsidered successful in helping to resolve disputes. Former Chief Justice Marilyn Warren of the Supreme Court has said that the courts would face di\ufb03culties if they did not use mediation.\nPower to/uni00A0give directions\nThe Civil Procedure Act states that the court may give any direction or make any order it considers \nappropriate at any stage of the proceeding. Judges can therefore actively manage civil proceedings. They can give directions before or during the trial. Sanctions can be imposed on a party who fails to comply with a direction of the/uni00A0court.\nThe power to give directions is also contained in the relevant rules of the court. For example, Rule \n34.01 of the Supreme Court Rules states that at any stage of a proceeding, the Supreme Court can give any direction for the conduct of the proceeding which it believes will assist in the e\ufb00ective, complete, prompt and economical determination of a dispute. \nWhat is a direction? \nA direction is an instruction given by the court to one or more of the parties, which imposes an obligation on a party to do something by a certain time or speci\ufb01es how a civil proceeding is to be conducted. It might be that they have to \ufb01le a particular document, attend court, or attend mediation by a certain time. Judges maintain control of a proceeding by giving directions along the way, so that delays can be minimised and the parties know what procedures they need to follow.\nDirections before/uni00A0trial\nThe judge has powers to give directions to the parties/uni00A0about:\n\u2022 the conduct of proceedings\u2022 timetables or timelines for any steps to be undertaken\u2022 participating in any method of dispute resolution, such as mediation \u2022 expert evidence, including directions about limiting expert evidence to speci\ufb01c/uni00A0issues\u2022 the allowance for a party to amend a pleading\u2022 discovery, including relieving a party from the obligation to provide discovery, or limiting discovery.\nDirections can be given at any time, but can be given at what are known as directions hearings, being \na pre-trial hearing before a judge or an associate/uni00A0judge.\nIn the below example a Supreme Court justice ordered the plainti\ufb00 to \ufb01le and serve an expert report \nat a directions hearing.Be careful not to \nconfuse directions hearings with committal hearings in criminal cases, which is a common mistake made by students. Committal hearings are only used in criminal cases. There is no equivalent in a civil case; that is, there is no hearing where a judge will determine whether there is enough evidence for a party to be successful at a trial. That decision is up to the parties in a civil/uni00A0case.Study/uni00A0tip\ndirections hearing a pre-trial procedure at which the court gives instructions to the parties about time limits and the way the civil proceeding is to be conducted\nDirection given by Supreme Court justice \nA plaintiff has filed a Statement of Claim in the Supreme Court of Victoria, and the defendant has \nfiled a Defence in response.

All of these \naspects of the civil justice system relate to  the way  in which courts operate to  resolve disputes.\nFollowing a consideration of these aspects of a civil trial, you  should be able to  consider the \nappropriateness of courts in resolving disputes, and their strengths and weaknesses.\nSource 1 Questions that can be asked when \nconsidering the court\u2019s appropriateness in resolving a certain disputeIs the dispute within\nthe court's\njurisdiction?Are there other or\nbetter ways to\nresolve the dispute?\nJurisdiction\nBoth the County Court and the Supreme Court of Victoria have  unlimited jurisdiction to  hear civil \ndisputes. That  is, it does not matter what amount the plainti\ufb00 is seeking; both those courts are  able to  hear \nthe dispute.\nThe Magistrates\u2019 Court jurisdictional limit is $100 000. A/uni00A0plainti\ufb00 who is seeking damages of more than \n$100 000 must issue the claim in either the County Court or the Supreme Court. A/uni00A0plainti\ufb00 who prefers \nto go to the Magistrates\u2019 Court can always  give  up part of the claim to  reduce it to  below $100 000. This \nbrings it within the Magistrates\u2019 Court\u2019s/uni00A0limit.\nVCAT  has exclusive jurisdiction over  some matters, so  courts cannot hear them. Those  matters \ninclude:\n\u2022 domestic building disputes\u2022 retail tenancies disputes\u2022 residential tenancies disputes\u2022 planning disputes.\nOther or better ways  to/uni00A0resolve a dispute\nThe parties should also consider whether there are  other or better ways  to resolve the dispute. Some of  \nthe things to  consider include:\n\u2022 whether they are  able to  resolve the dispute themselves through negotiation or mediation\n\u2022 the costs of taking a matter to  court, and whether C AV,  VCAT  or a private method might be/uni00A0better\n\u2022 whether they are  prepared to  accept the risks and uncertainty involved with a third party making a \ndecision on the dispute. This includes the possible risk of an adverse costs/uni00A0order\n\u2022 whether they have  access to  and are  able to  a\ufb00ord  legal representation, which is likely to  be necessary \nto undertake pre-trial procedures and for/uni00A0trial\n\u2022 whether they are  comfortable with the formalities of the courtroom and the rules of procedure\n\u2022 the size and complexity of the matter.

Y ou will explore arbitration in the next/uni00A0topic.\nStrengths and weaknesses of courts as dispute \nresolution bodies\nThe way courts resolve disputes has a number of strengths and weaknesses. \nThe main ones are discussed below, drawing on the information contained in Topics 7.4 to 7.8. The strengths and weaknesses are also relevant to determining whether courts are an appropriate dispute resolution body for a particular type of/uni00A0case. \nStrengths\nSome of the most important strengths are set out below in Source 3.\nSource 2 Are courts always the best option to \nresolve a dispute?\ncont.STRENGTH EXAMPLES\nThe court hierarchy \nallows for administrative convenience.\u2022 The court hierarchy allows for more serious and complex cases to be heard in the \nhigher courts, and lower courts to deal with less complex and minor claims.\n\u2022 The court hierarchy also enables courts to specialise in certain areas of law.\nThe court provides opportunities to the parties to reach an out-of-court settlement.\u2022 Various pre-trial procedures provide parties with an opportunity to settle the case \nbefore trial or before judgment. This saves the costs, time and stress of going to trial, making the system more accessible for people who want their disputes resolved.\n\u2022 The use of the judicial power to order parties to mediation assists in providing \nopportunities to settle.\nThe court allows the parties to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each other\u2019s case.\u2022 Pre-trial procedures, which are often made at the direction of the judge, help the \nparties decide if they admit certain facts or issues that are in dispute, which will help speed up the/uni00A0trial.\n\u2022 The parties must disclose critical documents early.\nThe court seeks to achieve procedural fairness through the way it conducts proceedings.\u2022 The judge can give any directions or orders that he or she wishes to ensure the civil \ndispute is resolved in a just, efficient, timely and cost-effective/uni00A0way.\n\u2022 The judge is responsible for ensuring the rules of evidence are followed to allow parties \nto be treated fairly.\n\u2022 The judge is an expert in law, legal processes and/uni00A0cases.\u2022 The court hierarchy allows for parties to appeal a case where an error has been/uni00A0made.\u2022 The use of the jury safeguards against misuse of power by having the state decide on \nliability.\n\u2022 Party control means that parties are more likely to be satisfied with the outcome, and \nthe judge is not able to interfere with the way a case is presented.\n\u2022 Parties are not forced into spending money to present their case. They get to choose \nhow much money they spend and how to present their case.\narbitration \na method of dispute resolution in which an independent person (known as an arbitrator) is appointed to listen to both sides of a dispute and make a decision that are legally binding on the parties.

This allows for \ncertainty of outcome, though parties may be able to appeal the decision.\nWeaknesses\nThere are also a number of weaknesses in the way courts resolve disputes.

These include:\n\u2022 mediation\u2022 conciliation\u2022 arbitration.\nMediation, conciliation and arbitration are often referred to as alternative dispute resolution \nmethods (ADR). However, their use is now so common that the word \u2018alternative\u2019 is becoming less \nappropriate to describe/uni00A0them.\nMediation, conciliation and arbitration are dispute resolution methods that can be used by the parties \nwithout going to CAV , VCAT or the courts. However, these methods are also used by some or all of these dispute resolution bodies to resolve disputes as an alternative to a \ufb01nal hearing or/uni00A0trial.\nVery few civil cases initiated in court will proceed to a \ufb01nal hearing or trial; in fact, it is estimated that \nfewer than 5 per cent of cases will proceed to hearing. Most cases settle before the \ufb01nal hearing or trial, often because the parties have attended mediation.\nIn this topic you will explore mediation and conciliation as methods of dispute resolution, and in Topic \n7.11 you will explore arbitration. For each method, you will consider how it is used by CAV , courts and VCAT, its appropriateness in resolving civil disputes, and its strengths and weaknesses.\nGetting to no:/uni00A0a study of settlement negotiations and the \nselection of cases for/uni00A0trial\nA trial is a failure. Although we celebrate it as the centrepiece of our system of justice, we \nknow that trial is not only an uncommon method of resolving disputes, but a disfavoured one. With some notable exceptions, lawyers, judges and commentators agree that pre-trial settlement is almost always cheaper, faster and better than trial. Much of our civil procedure is justified by the desire to promote settlement and avoid trial. More important, the nature of our civil process drives parties to settle so as to avoid the costs, delays and uncertainties of trial, and, in many cases, to agree upon terms that are beyond the power or competence of courts to dictate.\nSource: SR Gross and KD Syverud, \u2018Getting to No: A Study of Settlement Negotiations and the Selection of \nCases for Trial\u2019 (1991) 90 Michigan Law Review  319, 320EXTRACTalternative dispute \nresolution methods ways of resolving or settling civil disputes that do not involve a court or tribunal hearing (e.g. mediation, conciliation and arbitration); also known as appropriate dispute resolution\nYou should be able to distinguish between dispute resolution bodies (CAV, VCAT and the courts) and dispute resolution methods (mediation, conciliation and arbitration).

Mediation is a cooperative method of resolving \ndisputes that is widely used by courts, tribunals and other dispute resolution bodies.

They do this with the help of a mediator.\n07_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   244 10/10/2017   11:34 AM",

This was  in addition to  savings in litigation costs, courtroom \nfacilities, judgment writing time and reduction in stress on parties who are  \ngoing through litigation.\nSource 2 The key  features of mediationSource 1 Mediation is a cooperative method of \nresolving disputes.\nBODY HOW  MEDIATION  IS USED\nCourts \u2022 The Magistrates\u2019 Court, County Court and Supreme Court can refer civil disputes to  mediation. The \nparties may be ordered to  attend mediation at a fixed point before the cases are set down for trial \nor hearing, or earlier if possible\n\u2022 The parties may externally arrange a private mediator, or the court may refer the dispute to  judicial \nmediation (where an officer of the court will mediate the dispute)\nVCAT \u2022 V CAT often refers a claim to  mediation before a final hearing\n\u2022 In small civil disputes relating to  goods and services, VCAT  uses the SMAH dispute resolution \nmethod, in  which parties attend a  brief mediation conducted by a  VCAT  mediator.

They resulted in a  series of class actions brought on behalf of various people who had \nsuffered loss  and damage during the fires. Two  of those class actions were  known as the \nMurrindindi Black Saturday bushfire class action \nand the Kilmore East-Kinglake bushfire class action. Both class actions were  issued in the Supreme Court \nof Victoria, and were  ultimately settled through \nmediation.\nThe Supreme Court of Victoria reported that the \nMurrindindi bushfire class action settled after being referred to  court-led mediation, resulting in  significant \ncost and time savings for  the community, the legal \nsystem  and the parties.\nSeparately, the Kilmore East-Kinglake fire settled \nthrough an external mediation process. This class \naction settled after a  200-day trial before Justice Jack \nForrest. The trial involved 40  expert witnesses, and the \nuse of a paperless \u2018e-trial\u2019.\nConciliation\nYo u have  already studied conciliation in previous topics. Conciliation is a process of dispute resolution \ninvolving the assistance of an independent third party, with the aim of enabling the parties to  reach a \ndecision between them. The  third party does not make the decision, but listens to  the facts and makes \nsuggestions and assists the parties to  a mutually acceptable agreement or decision. The  conciliator assists \nby exploring solutions to  the dispute and suggesting possible options.\nConciliation can di\ufb00er from mediation in that the conciliator has more in\ufb02uence over  the outcome. \nThe conciliator, who is usually someone with specialist knowledge, suggests options and possible solutions \nand is more directive than a mediator.\nSource 5 The elements of conciliationLEGAL  \nCASE\nSource 4 The Kilmore East-Kinglake bushfire class action \nwas heard in a special courtroom in the William Cooper \nJustice Centre.\nCONCILIATION\ntwo disputing parties,\nwith possible \nrepresentativesresolution is made by \nthe parties, \nvoluntarily \u2013 it may \nbe on the advice of\n     the conciliatorresolution may be \nenforceable if \nterms of \nsettlement entered \nintoused by CAV  and \nVCAT.

An independent arbitrator \n(a third party given the task of presiding over  the discussion) will listen to  both sides and make a decision \nthat is binding on the parties. Unlike mediation and conciliation, in an arbitration the arbitrator makes a \n\ufb01nal and binding decision. It is known as an arbitral award , and it is enforceable.\nArbitration is often conducted in private, and it can be less formal and more cost-e\ufb00ective than \nattending a court hearing or trial. Parties have  much  more control over  the process and are  free to  agree  \non the procedure. They  may  be able to  agree  on how  evidence is to  be submitted, or the time by  which \nsteps  are to be completed.\nGenerally, the arbitrator:\n\u2022 is not bound by  rules of evidence but may  inform himself or herself on any  matter as he or she thinks/uni00A0\ufb01t\n\u2022 must ensure that the parties are  treated equally and each party is given a reasonable opportunity of  \npresenting their/uni00A0case\n\u2022 is not required to  conduct the proceedings in a formal manner.\nIn Victoria, arbitration is available/uni00A0when:\n\u2022 the parties have  agreed to  settle their dispute by  arbitration.

The blood test  showed elevated \nlevels  of human chorionic gonadotrophin, a  hormone produced by an  embryo.\nThe woman claims that given her history and symptoms, an ultrasound \nshould have been done to  \u2018see if the uterus and surrounding tubes were empty of pregnancy\u2019.\nIn failing to do  so, she says  her GP  and the hospital were  negligent and in  breach of  the duty \nof care they owed/uni00A0her.\nIn early December, the woman had a  further blood test  that showed her levels  of human \nchorionic gonadotrophin were still elevated.\nFive days later, she finally had an ultrasound that revealed a 20-week-old foetus.\nShe claims the negligence of her GP and hospital meant she was  unable to  terminate her \npregnancy.\nThe most recent Australian modelling in 2012, released in 2014 by AMP and the University \nof Canberra, put the cost to  a middle-income family of raising two children at $812 000.Source 1 In 2016, a mother \nlaunched a civil claim for damages after a failed pregnancy termination.\nSource 2 Types of damagesDAMAGES\ncompensatory exemplary nominal\nspecific general aggravatedcontemptuous\nCompensatory damages\nCompensatory damages are  the most common damages sought. The  aim is to  restore the party whose \nrights have  been infringed as far  as possible to  the position they were  in before the infringement, by  \ncompensating them for  losses su\ufb00ered. It may  not be possible to  do this where there has been physical \nloss; for  example, if a person has been left with a permanent injury, but damages can be given to  make up \nfor the fact that the person will su\ufb00er in the future.\nCompensatory damages can be speci\ufb01c damages (also referred to  as special damages), general \ndamages and aggravated  damages. These are  set out in Source 3 on the next page.\n07_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   255 10/10/2017   11:34 AM",
  "Page 268": "256 UNIT  3 RIGHT S AND JUSTICESource 3 Types of compensatory damages\nNominal damages\nWhen nominal damages are  awarded, a small amount of money is paid by  way  of damages. A/uni00A0plainti\ufb00  \nmay be seeking to  make a point about being legally in the right and to  show that their rights had been \ninfringed, but may  not be seeking a large sum of money in compensation. Instead, the plainti\ufb00  might  \nask for  only nominal damages or the court might award  nominal damages. Therefore, the purpose of  \nnominal damages is to uphold the plainti\ufb00\u2019s rights without awarding any  substantial amount of  \ndamages.\nFor example, in a defamation case,  nominal damages may  be awarded when the plainti\ufb00\u2019s character \nhas been tainted, but little damage has been done to  the plainti\ufb00\u2019s reputation.\nIn the below case nominal damages were  awarded for  copyright infringement to  show that SAI\u2019s \ncopyright rights had been infringed but a large sum of money was  not sought in compensation.SPECIFIC DAMAGES GENERAL DAMAGES AGGRAVATED DAMAGES\ncan be given a precise \nmonetary value. These can be \nlisted \u2013 such as medical \nexpenses or loss of wages \u2013 \nand are easily quantifiablewill be assessed by the court according to  the \nmagnitude of the wrong done and the long-term \nconsequences of the wrong, taking into consideration \nsuch matters as future loss of wages, long-term job \nprospects, and pain and suffering (future and past). They \nare a general estimate and not readily quantifiablecan be awarded to  compensate \nthe plaintiff further if the court \nbelieves that the defendant\u2019s \nconduct injured the plaintiff\u2019s \nfeelings by causing humiliation \nand insult\nCopying of information leads to  nominal damages\nSAI Global Property Division Pty Ltd v Johnstone [2016] FCA  1333  \n(14 November/uni00A02016)\nMr Johnstone was an  employee of  SAI Global Property Division Pty Ltd  (SAI). In  October 2015 he  \nresigned. Three days  before his resignation, Johnstone copied two  computer files containing \nconfidential and highly sensitive information. He commenced employment with a  competitor \ndays  after his resignation, and used the information that he copied from his former employer. \nSAI commenced proceedings against Johnstone seeking the delivery up of any information \ncopied from Johnstone.\nAt the hearing, SAI sought nominal damages of $1 for  copyright infringement, plus $4230 \nfor salary paid to  Johnstone and additional damages of $5000. SAI could not show that it had \nsuffered any loss  or that Johnstone had made any profit as a  result of  copying the confidential \ninformation, and so only sought nominal damages. Johnstone had admitted that what he had done was wrong, and did not oppose the nominal damages amount.\nThe court ultimately awarded $1 in  nominal damages for  copyright infringement, damages of  \n$4230 for  breach of  contract, and additional damages of  $5000. Costs were  also awarded to/uni00A0SAI.LEGAL  \nCASE\nContemptuous damages\nA court or tribunal might feel that the plainti\ufb00 has a legal right to  damages, but does not have  a moral right \n\u2013 that is,  the plainti\ufb00 did not really deserve to  be paid damages. In such a situation, small damages might \nbe awarded to  show contempt for  the claim that is made, while admitting the plainti\ufb00\u2019s right to  make the \nclaim as evidenced in the legal case on the next page.\n07_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   256 10/10/2017   11:34 AM",
  "Page 269": "257  CHAPTER 7  RESOLVING A CIVIL DISPUTEExemplary damages\n  Exemplary damages are the only consequence of a civil action that in some way seeks to punish the \ndefendant for an extreme infringement of rights, and deter others from undertaking the same type of actions. Exemplary damages are also known as punitive damages or vindictive damages (although this latter term is rarely/uni00A0 used).     The purpose of exemplary damages is to punish and deter the defendant where conduct is wanton, malicious, violent, cruel, insolent or in scornful disregard of the plainti\ufb00  \u2019s rights.   Exemplary damages cannot be awarded to a plainti\ufb00   for defamation.\nIn the case of Erlich v Leifer [2015] VSC 499, Justice Rush of the Supreme Court awarded exemplary \ndamages on top of compensatory damages to punish the defendant.Assault leads to contemptuous damages\nMedic v Kandetzi [2006] VCC 705 (13 June/uni00A02006)\nRoy Medic sued Paul Kandetzi, alleging that on 17 May 2002 in Black Rock, Kandetzi assaulted him. Medic claimed aggravated damages, alleging he was humiliated because the assault took place in a public place. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were self-represented at/uni00A0trial.\nHer Honour Judge Hogan of the County Court, in her reasons for judgment, stated that \nshe found the plaintiff to be a volatile personality on the hearing of the dispute, that he often shouted and talked over other witnesses, was prone to exaggeration and inconsistent in his evidence, and went from being loud and bullying in his manner to being apologetic to the Court. Her Honour said that her overall impression of the plaintiff was that he would \u2018say whatever he thought might help his situation at any given time\u2019. On the other hand, Her Honour found the defendant to be courteous and measured.\nAfter considering all of the evidence, Her Honour found that the proceeding was maliciously \nbrought, and should never have been made. In order to show the Court\u2019s disapproval of the plaintiff\u2019s conduct, she awarded him contemptuous damages. She stated:\nThese damages are appropriate to indicate a technical victory in that the plaintiff has \nproved that he has been assaulted by being fleetingly put in fear and that, technically, he \nwas the subject of a battery by the defendant placing his hands on the plaintiff's waist, but no injury, loss or damage has flowed from the assault or battery.\nHer Honour ordered that the defendant pay to the plaintiff the sum of five cents. She did not \naward the plaintiff any/uni00A0costs.LEGAL \nCASE\nExemplary damages in sexual abuse/uni00A0case\nErlich v Leifer [2015] VSC 499 (16 September/uni00A02015)\nThe plaintiff claimed that between 2003 and 2006, she was sexually abused by the headmistress \nof the school that she attended. Her injuries included severe psychiatric injury, and she claimed aggravated and exemplary damages against the headmistress, Leifer, and the school.\nThe plaintiff was awarded $1 024 428 in compensatory damages. Justice Rush of the \nSupreme Court, however, did not consider the award of compensatory damages to be sufficient for the purpose of deterrence or to impose a punishment on the school, which had been found to be directly and vicariously liable for Leifer\u2019s misconduct. Exemplary damages were awarded against Leifer for $150 000, and against the school for $100 000.LEGAL \nCASESource 4 Her \nHonour ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff the sum of five cents as contemptuous damages.\n07_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   257 10/10/2017   11:34 AM",
  "Page 270": "258 UNIT  3 RIGHTS AND JUSTICESquatters granted injunction\nBendigo Street applicants (SCV, Croft J, 14 August, unreported)\nIn August 2016, squatters who were occupying a number of empty homes in Collingwood, \nParkville and Clifton Hill were given 48-hour eviction notices. However, a last-minute application was made to the Supreme Court of Victoria, and Justice Croft granted an interim injunction which prevented Victoria Police and the State Government from forcibly removing them from the empty/uni00A0homes.\nEvidence was given by some of \nthe squatters about what would happen if they were evicted. They did not have legal representation at the hearing, but were assisted by a barrister.\nAn agreement was then reached \nwith the State Government which allowed the squatters to remain for three weeks so they could find housing.\nSource 5 In August 2016, an injunction application involving \nsquatters was heard in the Supreme Court of Victoria.LEGAL \nCASERestrictions on damages\nCertain types of claims and certain types of loss have restrictions imposed on damages. For example, for \npersonal injury claims made under the Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) (such as personal injuries su\ufb00ered from a negligent act), claims for non-economic loss, being pain and su\ufb00ering and loss of quality of life, are limited to $598 360 (as at 1 July 2017 \u2013 the amount increases year to year).\nIn defamation claims, damages for non-economic loss are also limited to $250 000 (thought in s ome \ncircumstances this can be increased).\nInjunctions\nAn injunction is a court order directing someone to stop doing a certain act, or compelling someone to do a certain act. The purpose of an injunction is to rectify a situation caused by the person who was found to be in the wrong. It can be either:\n\u2022 restrictive/prohibitive \u2013 ordering a person to refrain from undertaking an action (such as pulling \ndown a building, or an ex-spouse visiting a child at school)\nor\n\u2022 manda tory \u2013 ordering a person to do a particular act, such as performing their part of a contract they \nhave breached.An injunction (either a restrictive or a mandatory one) can be interlocutory or \ufb01nal. An interlocutory \ninjunction is a temporary injunction that is awarded quickly and in circumstances where there is an urgent \nsituation and an injunction is needed as soon as possible. This can be seen in the legal case below.\n07_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   258 10/10/2017   11:34 AM",

Peck tendered her resignation on 2 May 2016. Shortly prior to her last day of employment, Peck informed The Just Group that she intended to commence employment with Cotton/uni00A0On.\nThe Just Group sought an injunction to restrain Peck \nfrom commencing employment with Cotton On, including on the basis that Peck had various \u2018restraints of trade\u2019 clauses in her employment contract which sought to stop her from working for 50 different competitor companies, including Cotton On, for up to two/uni00A0years.\nThe claim was dismissed.

  "Page 272": "260 UNIT  3 RIGHTS AND JUSTICERemedies and their purposes\nTo what extent do remedies achieve their purposes? For example, to what extent can money \ncompensate a person for the loss of the ability to walk or for su\ufb00ering humiliation or years \nof post-traumatic stress? The extent to which a remedy can restore a plainti\ufb00 to the \nposition they were in prior to the breach of rights will vary from case to case and can \ndepend on many factors, including the individuals\u2019 circumstances and characteristics \nof the plainti\ufb00 (like their \ufb01nancial, emotional and economic circumstances and their \nresilience and support base) and the purpose of the plainti\ufb00\u2019s action (that is, what the \nplainti\ufb00 is ultimately hoping and seeking to achieve).\nWhile remedies are intended to achieve a particular purpose, in many situations they \ndo not. For example, if the plainti\ufb00 has su\ufb00ered the loss of a limb, or has a defect or disorder \nbecause of the wrongs that occurred, could any remedy achieve its purpose? If the plainti\ufb00 in \na defamation case has had their reputation ruined, how can that reputation ever be restored back to \nbefore a statement about him or her was published?\nIn some situations, two or more remedies may be appropriate. For example, a company may seek an \ninjunction restricting someone from trespassing on their land, and seek damages for the trespass that has already occurred. In this example, the purpose of these remedies is not only to compensate the company for losses they have already su\ufb00ered, but also to prevent further losses from happening by having an injunction in/uni00A0place.\nSource 9 shows the questions to be asked to determine whether a remedy can achieve its purpose in \na particular/uni00A0case.\nREMEDY QUESTIONS TO ASK WHEN DETERMINING TO WHAT EXTENT THE REMEDY ACHIEVES ITS PURPOSE\nDamages \u2022 What sort of loss has the plaintiff suffered \u2013 economic, physical, emotional, mental, \nreputational?\n\u2022 What is the appropriate measure for unquantifiable losses such as pain and suffering, \nhumiliation, reputation and loss of/uni00A0life?\n\u2022 Can money return the plaintiff to the position they were in before the harm occurred?\n\u2022 Can damages compensate for time in having the case heard, and for stress and \ninconvenience?\n\u2022 Does the defendant have the capacity to make payment?\u2022 What is the measure of future earning capacity?\u2022 Are there are any restrictions in place which limit the amount to be compensated (e.g. non-\neconomic loss for a personal injury claim under the Wrongs Act or for a defamation claim?\n\u2022 Is there any other reason for which the plaintiff may not be returned to their original \nposition?\n\u2022 Is there some other remedy, such as an injunction, that would better compensate the \nplaintiff?\nInjunctions \u2022 Has the defendant already done something damaging and the plaintiff is stopping the \ndefendant from causing any further damage?\n\u2022 Will an injunction stop the defendant from doing other things?\u2022 Will the defendant comply with the injunction?\u2022 Even if the defendant does comply with the injunction, does it mean the plaintiff is fully \nreturned to their original position?\n\u2022 Is there some other remedy, such as damages, that would better compensate the plaintiff?\nSource 9 Questions to ask when determining whether remedies achieve their purposes\nSource 8 A \ncompany can seek an injunction restricting someone from trespassing on their land.\n07_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   260 10/10/2017   11:34 AM",

However, despite some parts of our civil justice system that aim to reduce costs, many people involved in civil disputes may still pay high costs to have their disputes resolved. These high costs can sometimes discourage or prevent people from pursuing civil claims or defences.\nIn this topic you will explore three costs factors that a\ufb00ect the ability of the civil justice system to \nachieve the principles of justice.

The second factor \ncan both reduce and enhance the achievement of justice.\nLegal/uni00A0costs\nIn Chapter/uni00A06 you learnt about some of the costs associated with initiating a claim. \nOne of the costs incurred by the parties in resolving a civil dispute is the cost of \nlegal representation. In theory, everyone has the right to legal representation, \nbut in reality not everyone can a\ufb00ord this right. The nature of the court \nsystem relies on both parties having good legal representation. This way, \nthe chance of each party winning the case is maximised, the truth will \ncome out, and a fair outcome will be achieved. If one of the parties is poorly \nrepresented, or not represented at all, this will have a negative impact on \ntheir ability to receive a fair outcome.civil dispute \na dispute (i.e. disagreement) between two or more individuals (or groups) in which one of the individuals (or groups) makes a legal claim against the otherThese factors are specified in the VCE Legal Studies Study Design, and are different to the factors that you need to explore as part of Unit 3 \u2013 Area of Study 1, which are costs, time and cultural differences.

In practice, access is limited to substantial business enterprises, the very wealthy, and those who are provided with some form of assistance.\nSource: Chief Justice Wayne Martin, \u2018Creative a Just Future by Improving Access  \nto Justice\u2019 (Address delivered at the Community Legal Centres Association  \nWA Annual Conference 2012, Perth, 24 October 2012).EXTRACT\nSource 1  \nNavigating the civil \njustice system on your own can feel like having to find your way through a/uni00A0maze.\n08_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   266 10/10/2017   11:59 AM",
  "Page 279": "267  CHAPTER/uni00A08  REFORMING THE/uni00A0CIVIL/uni00A0JUSTICE SYSTEM  The amount of money a party spends on representation often depends on the nature of the dispute \nand the way the case needs to be resolved. For example, making a complaint through Consumers A\ufb00airs \nVictoria (CAV) is often free, whereas a more complex claim issued in the Supreme Court of Victoria will often result in both parties spending a signi\ufb01cant amount of money on legal/uni00A0costs.\nIn its 2014 review into access to justice (known as the Productivity Commission Review), the \nProductivity Commission estimated that the amount spent in legal costs by an average plainti\ufb00 on a Supreme Court matter was around $60 000. Signi\ufb01cant costs can be spent on pre-trial procedures such as discovery (refer back at Chapter/uni00A07 for more details about discovery), which can be high in large commercial and complex cases. Because many people do not have access to that sort of money, they are deterred from initiating or defending a court/uni00A0claim.\nFurthermore, most civil parties are not able to access legal aid, because the vast majority of legal aid \nfunding is spent on aid for criminal and family law cases rather than civil disputes. As a result, some people pursuing civil disputes are forced to settle or withdraw their claims because of the costs involved in taking a matter to trial, and some are not in a position to initiate a claim at/uni00A0all.\nIn addition to costs of legal representation, there are also court costs and disbursements (\u2018out of \npocket\u2019 expenses) associated/uni00A0with:\n\u2022 engaging expert witnesses and mediators\u2022 \ufb01ling and hearing fees\u2022 using a jury (if a party requests/uni00A0one).\nOn top of those costs is the possibility of having to pay some of the other side\u2019s costs if the claim or \ndefence is unsuccessful.\nThese costs are one of the reasons for the increase in self-represented parties in the courts. While \nVCAT encourages self-representation, it is not suitable for everyone. Many people need some assistance \nto help them navigate the system.\nJustice Bell recognised in Tomasevic v Travaglini that judges may need to explain matters to self-\nrepresented parties to ensure a fair hearing (explored in Chapter/uni00A05).

The parties agreed that the appeal should be allowed, but the Court of Appeal requested the parties to file a joint memorandum so it could be satisfied that a new trial was necessary, given the costs and time involved.\nOne of the key issues was that the applicant, Loftus, was unrepresented at trial, and the \nbank was represented. Loftus argued that the trial judge failed to explain certain matters to him, including the consequence of not calling a particular witness to give evidence at trial, not explaining to him his right to object to certain evidence, and restricting his cross-examination of a certain witness. He argued that because he was self-represented, the court had a greater role to play in ensuring the trial was fair, and it failed to/uni00A0do/uni00A0so.\nThe Court of Appeal stated that the judge has an overriding duty to ensure a fair trial, which \nincludes ensuring that a self-represented litigant understands and is able to vindicate his or LEGAL\nCASE\n08_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   267 10/10/2017   11:59 AM",

However, the assistance does not completely overcome the issues faced by a self-represented party. The assistance given to a self-represented party cannot extend to a person advocating (arguing) for that party.

Sometimes the other side\u2019s legal representatives will explain matters to a self-represented litigant, but they are not obligated to do so (legal practitioners are also often wary of the potential ethical implications should they assist a self-represented litigant when acting for an opposing party).

Its fees, particularly for smaller claims, are generally more favourable than court fees. VCAT also ensures lower costs by requiring parties to be self-represented in most cases. Resolving disputes through VCAT can also avoid the costs associated with pre-trial procedures and the formalities of a hearing (though this depends on the case, the parties and the type of dispute).\nAlthough VCAT was established to reduce some of the costs associated with resolving civil disputes, \nsince 2013 there has been an increase in many VCAT fees. These increases take into account the rising costs of operating VCAT, and the need to ensure access to justice.tribunal \na dispute resolution body that resolves civil disputes and is intended to be less costly, more informal and a faster way to resolve disputes than courts\nFurther increases were introduced as part of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (Fees) \nRegulations 2016 (Vic), which introduced:\n\u2022 hearing fees for some hearings \u2013 previously, no hearing fee was payable for most matters for the \n\ufb01rst/uni00A0day.\n\u2022 three tiers of fees \u2013 corporate (such as businesses with a turnover of more than $200 000 per y ear), \nhealth care card holders (i.e. people holding government health care cards), and standard (i.e. all other/uni00A0users)\n\u2022 a substantial increase in fees for corporate/uni00A0users.\n\u2022 a substantial reduction in fees for health care card/uni00A0users.\nThe new fees also broaden the fee relief provisions (i.e. waiving the fee for certain people) for people in \n\ufb01nancial hardship, holders of a health care card and victims of family violence, thus increasing accessibility \nto VCAT.

For example, application fees in the Residential Tenancies List (part \nof the Residential Tenancies Division at VCAT that hears and determines disputes between residential tenants and landlords), standard fees for claims up to $15 000 in 2017\u201318 was $62.70.

If a dispute takes a long time to be heard \u2013 or the hearing \nitself is very lengthy, it can become increasingly unfair to one or both parties. \nThe civil justice system is often seen as being slow. In this topic you will explore four time factors that \na\ufb00ect the ability of the civil justice system to achieve the principles of justice. These include:\n\u2022 court/uni00A0delays\u2022 VCAT waiting/uni00A0times\u2022 appeal processes\u2022 use of case management powers.\nCourt/uni00A0delays\nThe time it takes for courts to resolve disputes can \nvary greatly depending on the complexity of the case, the number of parties involved, and the court in which the claim was issued.\nIn 2014 the Productivity Commission Review \nfound that most disputes heard in lower courts were resolved within 6/uni00A0 months, while a third of cases heard in the superior courts took more than 12/uni00A0months.\nCourt delays have several causes. These \ninclude:\n\u2022 cour t backlogs \u2013 While delays in having cases \nlisted for trial (that is, obtaining a court date for \ntrial) have improved in recent years, it largely depends on the court.\n\u2022 pre-trial procedures \u2013 Pre-trial steps can be \ncomplex and lengthy. Most criticised is the process of discovery, which can take months. Courts that use case management processes often make orders about discovery and other pre-trial steps to streamline the process.\n\u2022 evidence gathering and preparation \u2013 The time it takes for the parties to get a case ready for trial (including gathering evidence and preparing for the hearing).\nThe principles of justice\nDelays have an impact on parties to a civil dispute. The Productivity Commission Review found that some people choose not to pursue a legal claim because it would take too long to resolve. Delays in getting an outcome can cause stress, wasted time and inconvenience. Delays can also add to the costs. They can even force parties to settle on poor terms or withdraw their claims or defences.\nSource 2 provides a summary of the way court delays can a\ufb00ect the ability of the civil justice system \nto achieve the principles of justice.case management \na method used by courts and tribunals to control the progress of legal cases more effectively and efficiently.

People are not deterred from issuing claims because \nof the long time it will take to have the matter heard, and disputes do not fester in the community.\n\u2022 Long waiting times, however, can reduce access to justice, as some people may be deterred from \npursuing their case, or may withdraw or settle their claim or defence because of the time taken \nto get an outcome. \nSource 4 VCAT waiting times and the principles of justiceVCAT waiting/uni00A0times\nVCAT is intended to be a speedier and more e\ufb03cient way of resolving \ndisputes. Generally, it is much faster than courts at resolving disputes. \nMost VCAT cases are heard in the Residential Tenancies List, and \nthe waiting time is signi\ufb01cantly lower than for a court. For tenants and landlords who wish to have a speedy resolution of rent matters, rental arrears, repairs and vacating premises, speed is helpful in ensuring these disputes do not drag on.\nHowever, the waiting times for some lists are signi\ufb01cant. \nA/uni00A0planning dispute takes about six months to resolve. This can be unfair for developers and businesses planning a development. Even a small civil claim can wait 10 weeks to be resolved.\nThe principles of justice\nSource 4 provides a summary of how VCAT waiting times can a\ufb00ect the ability of the civil justice system to achieve the principles of justice.VCAT LIST WEEKS\nBuilding and Property 14 \nCivil Claims 10 \nHuman Rights 14 \nLegal Practice 13 \nOwners Corporation 6 \nPlanning and Environment 25 \nResidential Tenancies 2 \nReview and Regulation 22\n08_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   275 10/10/2017   11:59 AM",

For example, the use of dispute resolution methods such as mediation is also a factor that can substantially assist in reducing the time it takes for a dispute to be resolved. You should look back on Chapters/uni00A06 and 7 to consider other time factors, such as the availability of Consumer Affairs Victoria to resolve certain types of civil disputes and the use of technology assisted review in undertaking discovery.Study tip Use of/uni00A0case management/uni00A0powers\nAs you explored in Chapter/uni00A07, the judge and magistrate have signi\ufb01cant powers of case management. \nThese include the powers to order the parties to mediate the dispute, and the power to give directions to the parties. Case management involves the transfer of some of the control and initiative of case preparation from the parties to the court. Tribunals such as VCAT also have powers of case management to ensure disputes are resolved e\ufb03ciently. \nCase management procedures are used widely across the courts and tribunals in Victoria and elsewhere \nin Australia, and can result in a signi\ufb01cant modi\ufb01cation of procedure rules, as well as modi\ufb01cation of rules relating to pleadings, discovery and evidence preparation.\nGiving the courts greater control over cases ensures that disputes are resolved in a more timely and \ncost-e\ufb00ective manner. The courts can, for example:\n\u2022 order that the parties attend mediation or some other form of dispute resolution/uni00A0method\u2022 limit the scope of discovery to ensure that it does not take too/uni00A0long\u2022 order that no pleadings are required\u2022 restrict the time for \ufb01nal hearings, including limiting the number of witnesses and the time to make \nsubmissions or cross-examine witnesses.\nIt is widely seen that case management procedures reduce delays, and a pro-active judge will help parties \nnarrow the issues in dispute, undertake only those steps that are relevant, and keep to the timelines set by the \ncourt. Judges achieve this by making orders along the way, and requiring them to be complied/uni00A0with.\nIn January 2017, the Supreme Court of Victoria\u2019s Commercial Court (which deals with large \ncommercial disputes) released a practice note which deals with case management. It emphasised that the overarching purpose is to facilitate the just, e\ufb03cient, timely and cost-e\ufb00ective resolution of the real issues in dispute. It also states that the aim is to resolve disputes e\ufb03ciently./uni00A0 \nAn extract from the practice note is provided below.pleadings \na pre-trial procedure during which documents are filed and exchanged between the plaintiff and the defendant and which state the claims and the defences in the dispute\npractice note \na document issued by a court which guides the operation and management of cases\n08_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   278 10/10/2017   11:59 AM",

This is \nparticularly important for vulnerable people who may need extra assistance in having their disputes resolved. For many decades access has been a problem, and the civil justice system has been criticised for being out of reach for many people. Lack of access can lead to valid civil claims being abandoned, withdrawn or settled for much less than what a party may be entitled/uni00A0to.\nIn this topic you will explore three accessibility factors that a\ufb00ect the ability of the civil justice system \nto achieve the principles of justice. These are:\n\u2022 barriers to communication\u2022 lack of services in rural and remote/uni00A0areas\u2022 the use of representative proceedings.\nThe \ufb01rst two factors can often reduce or restrict the ability of the civil justice system to achieve justice, \nwhile the third factor often enhances the ability of the civil justice system to achieve justice.\nBarriers to/uni00A0communication\nBarriers to communication can include anything that prevents a person from receiving and understanding \ninformation (e.g. ideas, thoughts and instructions) from other people or organisations. In a legal context, barriers to communication/uni00A0can:\n\u2022 prevent a person from understanding their legal/uni00A0rights\u2022 reduce a person\u2019s understanding of the methods and bodies used to resolve disputes\u2022 reduce a person\u2019s understanding of the processes involved in pursuing their rights.\nThe most common barrier to communication is language based. For example, if a person is unable \nto speak or understand English, they will have little chance of navigating the legal system. Barriers to \ncommunication are not restricted to people born overseas. They also extend to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. While more than 80 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples speak English at home as a \ufb01rst or only language, in some remote communities English is a second, third or fourth language.\nSource 1 Victoria Legal Aid provides translation services and legal information sheets in more than \n22 different languages. These services assist people from different cultural and language backgrounds to overcome barriers to communication.\n08_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   280 10/10/2017   11:59 AM",

The availability of interpreters for migrants also varies depending on the court. There is general recognition that information about legal rights and legal processes is required in languages other than English, and more attention to this aspect of access to justice is needed.\nThe/uni00A0principles of/uni00A0justice\nSource 2 provides a summary of the way barriers to communication can a\ufb00ect the ability of the civil justice system to achieve the principles of justice.\nPRINCIPLE BARRIERS TO COMMUNICATION\nFairness \u2022 People who are unable to communicate well in English may not understand their legal rights or \nthe dispute resolution methods or bodies that can help them resolve a dispute. This reduces their \nability to access procedures and engage in a trial or hearing, therefore reducing their ability to present their case in the best light possible.\nEquality \u2022 People who experience communication barriers may struggle to tell their side of their story. This \ncan make them unequal before the law or deny them an equal opportunity to present their case.\nAccess \u2022 A person with little understanding of their legal rights or the mechanisms used to resolve disputes \nmay abandon their claim or defence, may not know they have a claim or defence in the first place, or may compromise or withdraw their claim or defence just because they feel uncertain about what needs to happen to pursue their case.\nSource 2 Communication barriers and the principles of justice\nRural and regional Victoria\nStakeholders identified unmet legal needs in rural and regional Victoria. Around 30 per cent \nof Victoria Legal Aid clients live in a rural or remote area, which is higher than the proportion of Victorians who live outside Melbourne. Rural and regional communities in Victoria, as in the rest of Australia, consistently score higher on measures of disadvantage that correlate with high demand for legal assistance services.\nVictoria Legal Aid submits that its \u2018ability to provide effective and efficient services in \nregional and outer-metropolitan regions is hampered by the increased barriers to access in these areas\u2019. It also submits that its clients in these areas \u2018may experience different outcomes through the justice system compared with metropolitan residents\u2019.EXTRACTServices in/uni00A0rural and remote/uni00A0areas\nPeople living in rural and remote Victoria often \ufb01nd it more di\ufb03cult to access legal and dispute resolution services than people living in larger cities and towns, because those services may be insu\ufb03cient in those areas. For example, there may be fewer people available to provide legal services, and there may not be dispute resolution bodies such as courts in close proximity. \nThe Victorian Access to Justice Review Report reported on legal \nservices in rural and regional.

  "Page 295": "283  CHAPTER/uni00A08  REFORMING THE/uni00A0CIVIL/uni00A0JUSTICE SYSTEM  The use of/uni00A0representative proceedings\nRepresentative proceedings (also known as group proceedings or class actions) are proceedings \ncommenced by a lead plainti\ufb00 on behalf of seven or more persons who have a claim arising out of the same, similar or related circumstances. Since they were \ufb01rst introduced in Australia in 1992, the number of class actions has substantially increased, and they are now a familiar part of the civil litigation landscape. Representative proceedings increase people\u2019s access to dispute resolution. In March 2017, Justice Murphy of the Federal Court said \u2018It is important to remember that before the class action regime was introduced, it was either impossible, or at least exceedingly rare for consumers, cartel victims, shareholders, investors and the victims of catastrophe to recover compensation ...\u2019 . A/uni00A0person who has a legitimate claim against a big business may not otherwise have the desire or ability to pursue that claim, and therefore may abandon that claim. However, the availability of class actions enables that person to seek recovery for loss su\ufb00ered by joining with several other people who have a similar claim, even if each individual claim is/uni00A0small.\nA person who joins a class action does not have to personally attend trial, pay costs, give instructions \nto lawyers or give evidence (unless their evidence is critical to the issues in dispute). People in a class action may only need to be personally involved when deciding to join the class and when submitting a proof of claim if a payment is to be made.\nRepresentative proceedings, however, are not without criticism. While the process facilitates access \nto justice by ensuring people can go to court, some people believe that unmeritorious claims (claims without any basis) are more easily pursued, that the use of a litigation funder can erode the ultimate payment that is made to legitimate claimants, and that the risk of class actions can be detrimental to companies and businesses.representative \nproceeding a legal proceeding in which a group of people who have a claim based on similar or related facts, bring that claim to court in the name of one person (so it can be heard together); also called a class action or a group proceeding\nlead plainti\ufb00 \nthe person named as the plaintiff on behalf of the group members in a representative proceeding (i.e. class action)\nSource 6 In July 2017, the Nurofen class action settled for $3.5 million.

This class action is an example of a number of people joining a claim to seek recovery for loss even though each individual claim is small.\nIn January 2017, Victorian Attorney-General Martin Pakula asked the Victorian Law Reform \nCommission (VLRC) to undertake a review of the use of litigation funders in representative proceedings \nto ensure that litigants are not exposed to unfair risks or disproportionate cost burdens. This followed a Victorian Law Reform \nCommission (VLRC) Victoria\u2019s leading independent law reform organisation.

Mr Cummins will also examine whether clearer disclosure requirements should be imposed on litigation funders and lawyers representing funded plaintiffs concerning advice about the progress of the case, costs and possible outcomes. He will also consider whether any limits should be placed on the success fees that can be charged by a litigation funder.\nWhile litigation funders charge a percentage of the damages won by their clients, the LRC \nwill consider whether this form of billing should also be available to lawyers.IN \nTHE \nNEWS\nSource 7 Chair of the VLRC, The Hon.

For each of the recent reforms, you should consider the extent to which they will be able to improve, or have improved so far, the ability of the civil justice system to achieve the principles of justice.\nRecent reforms addressing costs factors\nSome recent reforms relating to costs factors include:\n\u2022 introduction of three-tier fee system in VCAT \u2013 From 1 July 2016, VCAT has three tiers of \nfees:/uni00A0corporate, standard and health care card holders. The health care card holders. fees are available \nto people who hold Commonwealth health care cards, and are capped at just over $150 regardless of the type of fee or the nature of the dispute. The fees are intended to ensure that VCAT remains accessible to the most vulnerable in society, and the fees are higher for companies, government agencies and businesses with an annual turnover of $200 000 or/uni00A0more.\n\u2022 use of Technology Assisted Review (TAR) in the Supreme Court \u2013 In a \ufb01rst for Victorian courts, \nthe Supreme Court of Victoria, in the December 2016 decision of McConnell Dowell Constructors (Aust) Pty Ltd v Santam Ltd (No. 1), approved the use of predictive coding or TAR to assist in the discovery process.

  "Page 299": "287  CHAPTER/uni00A08  REFORMING THE/uni00A0CIVIL/uni00A0JUSTICE SYSTEM  Recent reforms addressing time factors\nSome recent reforms addressing time factors include:\n\u2022 introduction of the Judicial Commission of Victoria (JCV) \u2013 In 2016, the Victorian Parliament \npassed the Judicial Commission of Victoria Act 2016 (Vic) which establishes the JCV . A/uni00A0person can make \na complaint to the JCV about the conduct or capacity of a judicial o\ufb03cer (which includes judges) or a member of VCAT. The types of complaints that can be made include excessive delays in handing \ndown judgments. It is expected that the JCV will establish higher standards when it comes to matters such as these, and may therefore address delay issues, particularly those involving long wait times for court decisions to be handed/uni00A0down. \n\u2022 changes to High Court appeal processes \u2013 In 2016, the High Court of Australia changed the way \nit hears special leave applications for appeals. Rather than allowing every special leave application to have an oral hearing, the High Court \ufb01rst determines, through a Panel of Justices, whether an oral hearing is necessary. If an oral hearing is not necessary, then the application is heard \u2018on the papers\u2019 . Most special leave applications are now heard \u2018on the papers\u2019 without an oral hearing. This reduces the costs and time involved in appearing before the High Court as it determines whether leave should be granted.\nRecent reforms addressing accessibility factors\nAt the state level, Victorian e\ufb03ciency measures include:\n\u2022 VLA online tool \u2013 In February 2017, Code for Australia and Victoria Legal Aid released a prototype \nonline tool which people with legal problems can use to determine whether they are eligible for legal \naid, advise people where they can go for help and which can answer simple questions for people. It is expected that the tool will expand to include various types of disputes.\n\u2022 use of technology \u2013 In January 2017, the Supreme Court of Victoria issued a practice note titled \n\u2018Technology in Civil Litigation\u2019 . Its purpose is to promote the use of technology in the conduct of civil litigation to reduce time and costs, as well as to assist parties in accessing documents and information for the purpose of trial. It speci\ufb01es that emails are the preferred communication with the court, that documents can be \ufb01led electronically, and that discovery can be conducted using technology. Court Services Victoria (CSV) in its 2015 \u2013 16 Annual Report also noted the changes to submitting \ndocuments electronically in some courts and lists, and VCAT has delivered additional online forms to make it easier for people to make applications.\n\u2022 removal of wigs \u2013 In May 2016, the Supreme Court of Victoria announced that judges will stop \nwearing wigs in all civil matters. Former Chief Justice Warren noted that wigs represented the past and did not assist in the administration of justice. Many believe that the removal of wigs allows the courtroom to feel more accessible to modern-day Australians, who may \ufb01nd the formality of wigs intimidating.\nThe ability of/uni00A0recent reforms to/uni00A0achieve \nthe/uni00A0principles of/uni00A0justice\nY ou should be able to discuss recent reforms in light of their ability to achieve the principles of justice, and \nthe extent to which they have overcome the factors that a\ufb00ect the achievement of justice.\nConsider the following questions for each recent reform you have chosen:\n\u2022 What problem, di\ufb03culty or issue is it trying to overcome?\n\u2022 Is it a short-term or long-term solution?member \n(in context of VCAT) the person who presides over final hearings and compulsory conferences at VCAT.

This includes replacing formal pleadings \nwith less-formal alternatives, requiring strict observance of time limits, and limiting traditional discovery. Discovery should be limited to documents that are directly relevant, and the courts should ensure that information technology is used to manage the process more e\ufb03ciently.Short Mediation and \nHearing (SMAH) a dispute resolution process used for small claims about goods and services in the Civil Claims List at the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT). Both the mediation and the hearing will be conducted on the same day (if the dispute is not settled at mediation)\n\u2022 greater legal aid funding \u2013 There is still a need to address longer-\nterm funding issues for legal service providers who provide legal aid, \nincluding Victoria Legal Aid and community legal centres. Inquiries have recommended that there be transparent and formal funding models, that funding be increased and that the funding take into account the demands of legal/uni00A0aid.\n\u2022 online system for the resolution of small civil claims \u2013 The Victorian \nAccess to Justice Review recommended that the Victorian Government establish a panel to oversee the introduction of an online dispute resolution system for small civil claims in Victoria. The idea would be to pilot its use for small civil claims, then consider its expansion to other claims. This was considered a more accessible and cost-e\ufb00ective way of resolving claims. The Victorian Government has agreed with this recommendation.\n\u2022  assist ance to self-represented parties \u2013 The Productivity Commission \nhas recommended that all court and tribunal forms be drafted in plain language, and guidelines be prepared for court and tribunal sta\ufb00 about how to assist self-represented litigants. The Victorian Access to Justice Review Report also recommended that there be better use of support people to assist self-represented litigants, that forms and information be reviewed to make them more accessible, and that there be education and training of sta\ufb00 to help them to assist self-represented parties.\n08_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   290 10/10/2017   11:59 AM",

VCAT orders require certi\ufb01cation in a court before they can be enforced. The report recommends that a monetary order of VCAT should be considered an order of an appropriate court (i.e. be automatically enforceable without having to be certi\ufb01ed).

This would include building on their existing telephone hotlines and websites, and referrals should occur where appropriate. Information and training materials should also be shared.

She carried  out the \ufb01nancial  and \nadministrative  duties  of her business  from  Bonnie  Doon,  \nand visited the  shop about  once  every  two weeks.

He was  an unpopular monarch because he raised taxes and led the  \ncountry to  defeat in a  number of overseas wars.  The English nobles (i.e. powerful landowners such as lords and  \nbarons) took action and forced the king to  sign a  charter (i.e. legal document) known as the Magna Carta. \nThe signing of the Magna Carta marked a  very  signi\ufb01cant point in the development of English law  because  \nfor the \ufb01rst time the English monarch was  subject to  the will of  others, not just God. The  nobles became part  \nof the King\u2019s Great Council and advised him on a  range of matters. In around 1236, the word  parliament was  \n\ufb01rst used to  describe the Great Council.\nFrom  1295 onwards, parliament began to  meet regularly, and from around  \n1350 onwards two  separate groups formed and began meeting separately.  \nThese groups included:  \n\u2022 nobles (i.e. lords and barons) and the clergy (i.e. members of the church  \nsuch as bishops) \u2013  this group met in one house which became known as  \nthe House of Lords (or upper house)\n\u2022 the knights and townspeople (selected to  represent each county or town)  \n\u2013 this group met in another house which became known as the House of  \nCommons (or lower house).\nDuring the seventeenth century, the Stuart kings tried to  override the authority  \nof parliament. Con\ufb02ict between the monarchs and the parliament grew  during the  \nrule of James I/uni00A0(1603\u201325) and his son Charles/uni00A0I/uni00A0(1625\u201349). These kings claimed  \nthat they ruled by  divine right (i.e. God\u2019s will). However, the power of the people overcame the divine right  \nof kings when Charles I/uni00A0was brought to  trial for  treason against the people. He was  beheaded, and Oliver  \nCromwell led the country without a  monarch for  a short period. The  Crown was  restored in 1660, when  \nCharles II came to  the throne. Both Charles II and his brother, James II, who followed him, were  unpopular  \nwith the people. James converted to  Catholicism, and when he had a  son in 1688, a  group of Protestant nobles  \nasked William III of Orange and his wife Mary to  bring an army  to take  the throne and re-establish Protestant  \nrule, on the condition that they would govern  with respect  for the rights of their subjects.\nAfter this time the law-making power stayed with the parliament, and the monarch had very  few powers.  \nThe British parliamentary system is called the Westminster system,  after the British Parliament situated at  \nWestminster in London.

The Australian Constitution was passed by the \nBritish Parliament and its formal title is Commonwealth of  \nAustralia Constitution Act 1900 (UK)Throughout Unit 4, you  will learn about the Australian Constitution and its role in protecting the Australian  \npeople. To  understand the Australian Constitution and why  it was  created, you  need to  understand how  \nAustralia became a  uni\ufb01ed country. This uni\ufb01cation process is known as the Federation of Australia.\nIn the nineteenth century, Australia was  made up of di\ufb00erent British colonies. Each of our present states  \nwas a separate colony, with the power to  make its own  laws  for the people of that colony.  \nDuring the 1870s and 1880s there was  a real fear of invasion. People were  concerned about the arrival  \nof non-British immigrants and the lack of  a common immigration policy. This made them realise that there  \nwas a need for  a central government that could make laws  on matters such as these, which could apply to  \nthe whole of Australia and bene\ufb01t the entire country. The  colonies saw  the advantage of having consistent  \nlaws in the national interest \u2013  for example, to  strengthen Australia\u2019s defence and to  simplify immigration, rail  \ntransport, tari\ufb00s and trade issues.  \nBy the 1880s each of the six colonies had begun formal discussions to  consider federating. They  needed  \nto agree  on which laws  they would allow a  central parliament to  make and which areas of law-making power  \nthey would keep  as individual colonies.  \nIn the 1890s each of the colonies sent a  group of representatives to  special meetings (called constitutional  \nconventions). At the conventions it was  decided that a  new central Commonwealth Parliament would be  \ncreated. A/uni00A0draft federal constitution bill was  prepared and submitted to  the Australian people for  voting in  \n1898 and 1899. In each colony a  majority of voters approved the/uni00A0bill.\nThe result of the constitutional conventions and the voting on the bill was  the Federation of Australia.  \nWith the approval of Britain, the separate colonies became states with their own  parliaments and a  central  \nbody, the Commonwealth Parliament, was  formed. The  Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act  1900  \n(UK) is the formal document by  which the process of federation was  achieved. It is an Act  of the British  \nParliament and it came into force on 1  January 1901, the date  celebrated as the anniversary of the Federation  \nof Australia.\nCHECK YOUR LEARNING 9.2 \nDe\ufb01ne and explain\n1 W hy did the British colonies in di\ufb00erent parts of \nAustralia want to  unite to  form  a federation?\n2 What is the formal title of the Australian Constitution \nand which parliament passed/uni00A0it?\n3 What date  is the anniversary of the Federation of \nAustralia?\nSynthesise and/uni00A0apply\n4 Research the constitutional conventions.a Who were  some of the key  people involved?\nb What was  the subject of the major arguments \nbetween the colonies, and/uni00A0why?\nc Who is credited with writing the \ufb01rst draft of a \nconstitution?\n5 Conduct some research on how  the colonies voted on \nthe Federal Constitution/uni00A0Bill.\na When was  the Victorian vote/uni00A0held?\nb What was  the outcome of the/uni00A0vote?\nc Which state  was least in favour of federation?/uni00A0Why?\nCheck your obook assess for  these additional resources and more:\n\u00bb Student book \nquestions\n9.2 Check your learning\u00bb Video tutorial\nIntroduction to  Unit 4\u00bb Worksheet\nFederation of Australia\u00bb Weblink\nAustralian Parliament \u2212 \nhistory of federation\n09_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   305 10/10/2017   12:09 PM",

A/uni00A0representative democracy is a system in which the \npeople vote  to elect representatives to  the parliaments and to  make the law  and govern  on their behalf. \nIn Australia,  there  are six state parliaments  and one Commonwealth  Parliament,  located  in our nation\u2019s  \ncapital,  Canberra.

The role of a constitution is to determine the \npowers and duties of the government. Many countries around the world (such as Canada, India, New Zealand, the United States and the United Kingdom) have constitutions. Some of these constitutions guarantee certain rights to the people of those countries.\nMany countries such as the United States and India have formal \nwritten constitutions; others such as New Zealand and the United Kingdom do not. Instead, those countries have a set of documents which collectively establish the rules by which they are governed.\nAustralia has a formal written constitution. It is commonly known \nas the Australian Constitution or the Commonwealth Constitution, but its long title is the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (UK). It came into force on 1 January 1901 after the citizens in each of the separate colonies voted in favour of federating as one united body (details about federation are contained in Chapter/uni00A09). \nIn comparison with other legal documents, the Australian \nConstitution is very short \u2013 especially considering it is the most important legal and political documents a\ufb00ecting the lives of all Australians.\nFeatures of/uni00A0the Australian Constitution\nSome of the main features of the Australian Constitution are as follows:\n\u2022 it establishes the Commonwealth Parliament and outlines its structure, including how its two houses, \nthe House of Representatives and the Senate, are to be composed. \n\u2022 it establishes the High Court of Australia and gives it powers to interpret the Constitution\n\u2022 it sets out matters relating to the states. The Constitution expressly provides that state laws will \ncontinue in force in the state which made them unless they are altered or repealed\n\u2022 it facilitates the division of law-making powers by setting out what law-making powers are held by \nthe Commonwealth Parliament\n\u2022 it provides a mechanism by which the Australian Constitution can be changed \n\u2013 i.e. by means of a referendum.\nUnlike the American Constitution, the \nAustralian Constitution does not contain a \nbill of rights. A/uni00A0bill of rights is a document that lists the most important rights given to the citizens of a country (such as the right to free speech).\nAlthough our Constitution does not \ncontain a bill of rights, it does provide protection for a limited number of rights, such as the right to freedom of religion.constitution \na set of rules that establishes the nature, functions and limits of government \nAustralian \nConstitution, the a set of rules and principles that guide the way Australia is governed.

The \nopposition questions the government about policy matters and is responsible for holding them to  accountThe House of/uni00A0Representatives\nThe House of Representatives (the lower house) is sometimes referred to  as \u2018the people\u2019s house\u2019.  This \nhouse re\ufb02ects the current opinion of the people at  an election, because it determines which party or \ncoalition of parties should form  government. It is therefore also known as \u2018the house of government\u2019.\nThere are  150 members of the House of Representatives and each member represents an electoral \ndivision. The  term  of o\ufb03ce for  members of the House of Representatives is three years. In Australia, \nvoting in an election is compulsory. To  be eligible to  vote,  a pers on must be 18/uni00A0years old and registered \nto/uni00A0vote.\nThe political party (or coalition of parties) that achieves the majority of elected members to  the \nHouse of Representatives becomes the government of the day.  The leader of that political party becomes \nthe prime minister who appoints government ministers.\nThe party with the next-highest number of elected members becomes the opposition. The  leader of  \nthe opposition appoints shadow ministers. A/uni00A0shadow minister is usually appointed for  every  government \nminister. Their role is to  keep  a check on the activities and responsibilities of the corresponding government \nminister. For  example, while there is a Minister for  Defence in the Commonwealth Government, there \nis also a member of the opposition, known as the Shadow Minister for  Defence, who has the role of  \nscrutinising the decisions made by  the minister and ensuring he or she is accountable to  the parliament.

A/uni00A0bill is a proposed law,  which must go  through speci\ufb01c \nstages  to become a statute (also known as an Act of Parliament or legislation). The  bill must pass through \nthe \ufb01rst house before it goes on to  the other house, where it goes through the same processes before it \nreceives royal  assent (the signing and approval of the proposed law  by the Crown\u2019s  representative) and \nbecomes law.

In this way  the Senate represents the interests of the states \nin law-making.\n\u2022 scrutinise bills through the committee process \u2013 The  Senate has a number of committees, \nincluding the Senate Standing Committee for  the Scrutiny of Bills.

For \nthe purposes of electing members to the Council, Victoria is divided into eight regions, each consisting of 11 districts. Five members of the Legislative Council are elected for each region, making a total of 40 members of parliament to be elected. Members for each region are elected to serve a \ufb01xed four-year/uni00A0term.\nThe election for the Legislative Council uses a proportional \nrepresentation system. Candidates are elected by obtaining a predetermined proportion, or quota, of the total votes. Once a candidate has obtained the required quota, any excess votes he or she receives are transferred to another candidate in the voters\u2019 order of preference.\nThe primary role of the Legislative Council is to act as a house \nof review.

It acts as a \nhouse of review for legislation that has been passed in the Legislative Assembly. It does this by scrutinising, \ndebating and, on occasion, amending or rejecting legislation that has been initiated by the government.

This requires an e\ufb00ective electoral system, parliament, government and \ncourts. It is also essential that the majority of people are con\ufb01dent that their community functions as a democracy.\nThere are three main roles of the Crown in \nlaw-making:\n\u2022 granting royal/uni00A0assent\u2022 withholding royal/uni00A0assent\u2022 appointing Executive Council. \nGranting royal/uni00A0assent\nThe Crown\u2019s representative in both the \nCommonwealth Parliament (i.e. the Governor-General) and the Victorian Parliament (i.e. the Governor of Victoria) is required to approve bills before they can become law. This is known as royal assent. Royal assent is normally given \nas a matter of course on the advice of the prime minister or ministers at the Commonwealth level, and on the advice of the Premier of Victoria or ministers at the Victorian/uni00A0level.\nWithholding royal/uni00A0assent\nThe Crown\u2019s representative has the power to withhold royal assent (that is, refuse to approve a bill and therefore make it an Act of Parliament). However, this rarely occurs, and the ordinary course is that the Queen\u2019s representative will approve bills. \nAt a federal level, the Australian Constitution speci\ufb01es the circumstances in which the Governor-\nGeneral can withhold royal assent.\nAppointing Executive Council\nThe Governor-General (or governor of each state) has the responsibility of appointing the Executive Council. This comprises the leader of the government (the prime minister at the federal level and the premiers at the state level) as well as senior ministers. \nThe role of the Executive Council is to give advice on government matters as well as approve \nsecondary legislation (also known as delegated or subordinate legislation).

Those  \npowers are  exercisable by  parliament, which is the supreme law-making body in Australia (meaning it \nhas the ultimate authority to  make laws  and can change laws  whenever it wants to,  so long as it is acting \nwithin its powers). There are  a signi\ufb01cant number of areas in which laws  need to  be made in Australia and \ninclude roads, education, tax, currency, marriage, trade and/uni00A0crime.\nThe creation of the Commonwealth Parliament required the Australian Constitution to  specify the \nway law-making powers were  to be shared. The  colonies agreed on the areas where the Commonwealth \nParliament was  to make laws,  and the areas where the state  parliaments would retain their power to  make  \nlaws.

Marital status, under the Sex Discrimination \nAct, was defined to/uni00A0mean:\nthe status or  condition of  being single, married, married but living separately and apart \nfrom one\u2019s spouse, divorced, widowed or the de facto spouse of another person.\nThe provision of IVF services is a  service under the Sex Discrimination Act. Therefore, under \nthis Act it is unlawful to  refuse to  provide the IVF service on the grounds that the person is not \nmarried or living in a de facto relationship.\nThis was tested  through the courts. Dr John McBain, a  specialist IVF doctor, was  directly \naffected by the inconsistency in the legislation. By  denying single or lesbian patients access  to \nthe IVF program, he  was  meeting the requirements of  the Victorian Infertility Treatment Act but, \nat the same time, contravening the Commonwealth Sex Discrimination Act. He had previously \nbeen fined under the Commonwealth Sex Discrimination Act. Under the Victorian Infertility \nTreatment Act,  however,  it was  an offence for  a doctor to  treat a  woman who was  not married. \nThe Commonwealth Sex Discrimination Act makes it an  offence to  discriminate against a  person \non the basis of, among other things, marital status.\nTo establish the inconsistency, McBain was  required to  show that a  specific patient was  being  \ndenied the service; in  this case, that person was  Leesa Meldrum. The Federal Court upheld McBain\u2019s  \nargument that the Victorian marital status requirement was  inconsistent with the Commonwealth  \nprovision and that, on the basis of Section 109 of the Australian Constitution, the Commonwealth  \nlaw should prevail. Therefore, the discriminatory section of the Victorian law was  invalid.The effect  \nof this decision was  that couples could  not be  denied IVF services on  the basis of  marital status and  \ntherefore single and lesbian patients should be allowed access to  the services.\nFollowing the decision in  this court case, the Victorian Infertility Treatment Authority decided \nthat even  though providers could not discriminate on marital status, they could only provide \ntreatment to  infertile/uni00A0women.\nThe law \nis now  clear in this area under Section 10 of the Assisted Reproductive Treatment \nAct 2008 (Vic). A/uni00A0woman can  undergo reproductive technology where a  doctor is satisfied, on \nreasonable grounds, that in the woman's circumstances, she is unlikely to  become pregnant \nother than by a treatment procedure.\nSource 1 The McBain case highlights the significance of Section 109 of the Australian Constitution.provided that, in order to  receive treatment, a \nwoman must be:\n\u2022 married and living with her husband on a \ngenuine domestic basis or\n\u2022 living with a man in a de facto relationship. S8 of the Infertility Treatment Act 1995 (Vic) S22 of the Sex  Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) \nprovides that it is unlawful for a person who, whether for payment or not, provides goods or services, or makes facilities available, to  \ndiscriminate against another person on the ground of the other person\u2019s sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status, marital or relationship status, pregnancy or potential pregnancy, or breastfeeding.MARITAL STATUS \n10_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   327 10/10/2017   12:31 PM",

First, Section 109 can act as a restriction on state  parliaments. It does so  \nbecause it provides that, if a state  parliament passes a law  in an area where there is a Commonwealth law,  \nthe federal law  will prevail over  the state  law to the extent of the inconsistency. That  means that the state  \nparliament will, in passing laws  in areas of concurrent powers, recognise that its powers are  constrained \nwhere a Commonwealth law  already exists.\nFor example, marriage is an area of concurrent power. The  Commonwealth Parliament has already \npassed legislation dealing with marriage, namely the Marriage Act  1961 (Cth). That  Act states that the \nmarriageable age  is 18 years. People aged  16 and 17 can only marry in exceptional circumstances and \nwith the approval of a court. The  state  parliaments will recognise that any  law passed by  them which \ncontradicts this law  will, if challenged, be invalid.\nHowever, Section 109 does not automatically operate such that the state  parliament lacks the power to  \npass a law  which is inconsistent with a Commonwealth law.  First, the law  needs to  be challenged before it \nis declared to  be invalid (that is,  the court will need to  determine whether the two  laws  are inconsistent). \nSecond, if  at some time in the future the Commonwealth law  is abrogated  or changed, and the state  law \ncontinues to  be in existence, then the state  law will be in force and have  e\ufb00ect. That  is, the state  law will \nhave  no practical e\ufb00ect only for  so long as the Commonwealth law  remains in/uni00A0force.\nSection 109 is also signi\ufb01cant because it imposes a consistent approach to  the way  inconsistencies \nbetween state  and Commonwealth laws  will be dealt with. That  is, there is no doubt that the Commonwealth \nlaw will prevail. \nCHECK YOUR LEARNING 10.5 \nDe\ufb01ne and explain\n1 Is Section 109 of the Australian Constitution \nrelevant/uni00A0to:\na inconsistencies between Commonwealth laws  and \nterritory/uni00A0laws\nb inconsistencies between di\ufb00erent state/uni00A0laws?

  "Page 342": "330 UNIT  4 THE PEOPLE AND THE  LAWThe Australian Constitution does leave certain matters about the composition of the Houses to  be \nlegislated by  the Commonwealth Parliament. For  example, Section 7 states that \u2018until the Parliament \notherwise provides there shall be six senators for  each Original State\u2019 . In 1983, the Commonwealth \nParliament passed the Representation Act  1983 (Cth), which states that the number of senators for  each \nstate  shall be 12. \nThe Australian Constitution does not require state  parliaments to  be bicameral parliaments. This is \nwhy the Queensland Parliament was  not constitutionally prevented from abolishing its upper house in \n1922, converting it from a bicameral parliament to  a unicameral/uni00A0one.\nChecking process\nThe bicameral structure of  the Commonwealth Parliament is designed to  act as a check on parliament in \nits law-making role. The  Senate in particular is designed to  operate as a house of review. \nAs explored earlier, most bills are  introduced into the lower house, which means that the Senate will, \namong its duties, act as a house of review and as a state\u2019s house. This means that the Senate\u2019s role is to  \nreview bills already passed by  the lower house. It also means that when reviewing bills, senators should in \ntheory vote  according to  not only the wishes of their political party but also the interests of their state.  In \nthis way,  a broad range of views is considered before the bill can pass the Senate. It also means that any  \nlegislation that appears to  support one state  over  the others would quickly be rejected.\nIn reality, however, some senators vote  on bills according to  the wishes of their political party rather \nthan according to  the interests of their state.  If the government holds a majority in both the upper house \nand the lower house, the Senate tends to  be a \u2018rubber stamp\u2019,  merely con\ufb01rming the decisions made in \nthe lower house. This may  a\ufb00ect the checks and balances that are  designed to  protect against misuse of  \npower if the upper house is simply \u2018ticking the box\u2019 when voting on legislation.\nIn recent years, the government has not held majority in the upper house, which has meant that rather \nthan the Senate acting as a \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 , there has been considerable debate about and often substantial \namendments to  legislation bef\nore it is passed.\nAmendment  to Section  18C  rejected\nHuman Rights Legislation \nAmendment Bill 2017 (Cth)\nOn 22 March 2017 Senator Brandis, the \nAttorney-General for the Commonwealth \nLiberal-National Government, introduced \nthe Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017 (Cth) into the Senate.

Section 18C makes it unlawful for  a \nperson to  do an act that is reasonably likely \nto offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate a  \nperson or group because of race, colour or national ethnic origin. \nThe Commonwealth Government tried to  replace the words \u2018offend, insult, humiliate\u2019 with \nthe word  \u2018harass\u2019, which was  seen by  some to  \u2018water down\u2019 Section 18C (which aimed to  prevent CASE \nSTUDYA foreign citizen \ncannot be a member of the Commonwealth Parliament because of Section 44 of the Australian Constitution.

After the \n2004 federal election, the Howard Government controlled both houses.

This power of the upper \nhouse operates as a  check on the power of parliament to  pass laws, so that laws cannot be \nintroduced that might be considered inappropriate.\n10_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   331 10/10/2017   12:31 PM",

It is one of the core principles of the rule of/uni00A0law.\nThese powers include:\n\u2022 executive/uni00A0power\n\u2022 legislative/uni00A0power\n\u2022 judicial/uni00A0po wer.\nExecutive/uni00A0power\nExecutive power is the power to administer the laws and manage the business of government.

This power resides with the parliament under Chapter I/uni00A0of the Australian Constitution. Speci\ufb01cally, Section 1 of the Australian Constitution states that the legislative power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in the Federal Parliament.\nIn Australia, the legislative power and the executive power are combined at a federal level. In \npractice the power to administer the law and carry out the business of government (the executive power) is placed in the hands of the Cabinet rather than the executive. The Cabinet consists of the prime minister and senior ministers, whose main role is to decide on general government policy and formulate proposed laws to be introduced to parliament. The head of the executive, in practice, is the prime minister, not the monarch or the monarch\u2019s representative.\nThe executive power and the legislative power are also closely linked by the fact that laws passed by \nparliament must receive royal assent from the Governor-General to become law. There are also many Acts of Parliament that give the Executive Council (the Governor-General and senior ministers) the right to make regulations, but parliament retains the right to disallow or reject these regulations.separation of powers \na doctrine established by the Australian Constitution that ensures the three powers of our parliamentary system (i.e. executive power, legislative power and judicial power) remain separate.

It \nis provided for under Chapter III of the Australian Constitution, and is vested in the High Court and other federal courts (as well as courts that are invested with federal jurisdiction). Section 71 in particular states that the judicial power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in the courts.\nCommonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900/uni00A0(UK) \n71 Judicial power and/uni00A0Courts\nThe judicial power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Supreme Court, to \nbe called the High Court of Australia, and in such other federal courts as the Parliament creates, and in such other courts as it invests with federal jurisdiction. The High Court shall consist of a Chief Justice, and so many other Justices, not less than two, as the Parliament prescribes.EXTRACTIn the US, federal \njudges are appointed, then confirmed in a Senate hearing. State judges are elected. This has been criticised in Australia because it makes the role of the judge political, bringing them under pressure to please voters rather than focusing on the/uni00A0law.Did you/uni00A0know?\nThe legislative power and the judicial power must be kept separate. Only a court or tribunal has the \npower to decide if a law (made by parliament) has been contravened. It is the sole province of the High \nCourt to decide disputes on issues involving the Constitution although, as a secondary role, the courts have the power to make law (explored further in Chapter 13). At a state level these lines of separation are less clearly de\ufb01ned.\nAlthough the state and federal governments appoint judges, the courts are independent of political \nin\ufb02uence. In this way, citizens are safeguarded from the misuse of political power or corruption in the resolution of disputes. The impartiality of judges is protected by the fact that federal judges, for example, are appointed until the age of 70 and cannot be removed unless there is proven bad conduct and parliament approves their removal.\nReasons for/uni00A0the separation of/uni00A0powers\nThis principle of separation of powers prevents power from being concentrated in one set of hands and helps to protect individual rights by providing checks and balances on the power of the Commonwealth Parliament. No one body can make law, administer law and also rule on its legality.\nThe government and the parliament must work together \nto pass laws, and the independence of the judiciary must be preserved. For example, a person who feels a parliament has passed a law that contravenes the Constitution or basic human rights can take the matter to court.

However, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions appealed \nboth sentences, arguing they were too lenient. \nOn 9 June, the Victorian Court of Appeal heard the appeals. They were conducted in the \nstandard way, which included the judges, in the ordinary course of the hearing, asking the lawyers questions. Once the hearings were concluded, the Court reserved its judgment (that is, the decision on the appeal was to be handed down on a later date). \nOn 13 June, the Australian newspaper \npublished an article about one of the cases, titled \u2018Victorian judiciary \u201clight on terrorism\u201d\u2019. The article stated that senior ministers had claimed the Victorian judiciary was \u2018advocating lighter sentences for terrorists\u2019. Health Minister Greg Hunt had \u2018blasted\u2019 the Victorian court system for \u2018becoming a forum for \u201cideological experiments\u201d\u2019. Human Services Minister Alan Tudge and Assistant Treasurer Michael Sukkar, both federal ministers, were also said to have made statements, including that the judiciary should focus more on safety and victims, and that judges seemed more concerned about the welfare of the terrorists. The article was published after the appeal hearings, but before judgment was handed down. \nThe Court of Appeal released a statement on 16 June 2017 about the cases and the article. \nAs part of the statement, it said:\nGiven that the court\u2019s decisions in both cases were pending, the court is concerned that \nthe attributed statements were impermissible at law and improperly made in an attempt to \ninfluence the court in its decision or decisions. Further, the court is concerned that some of the statements purported to scandalise the court. That is by being calculated to improperly undermine public confidence in the administration of justice in this state in respect of the disposition of the appeals that the court has presently under consideration.\nIt also said the statements on their face had failed to respect the separation of powers, and \nreflected a lack of proper understanding of the importance of the independence of the judiciary \nfrom government. \nThe Court\u2019s Judicial Register wrote to the three ministers and the publisher, editor and \njournalist about the article, asking them to appear before the Court to explain why they should not be referred to prosecution for contempt of court. \nThe three ministers ultimately made an unconditional apology to the Supreme Court, stating \nthat they were wrong to have made the statements. They apologised after they had watched the hearing and reviewed the transcripts of the hearing. Fiona McLeod SC, president of the Law Council of Australia, said that the apology showed \u2018respect for the separation of powers and the rule of law\u2019. \nOn 23 June 2017, the Court of Appeal handed down its decisions in the two cases. The appeal \nwas allowed in both cases, and the prison sentences for both offenders were increased. \nSource 3 Health Minister Greg Hunt was one of the three federal \nministers forced to apologise about the comments he made in the Australian newspaper article.\n10_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   337 10/10/2017   12:31 PM",
  "Page 350": "Strengths and weaknesses\nThere are a number of strengths and weaknesses in the separation of powers acting as a check on \nparliament in law-making.\nSource 4 Question time can allow for members of the opposition to challenge \nthe government. This allows for ministers to be subject to scrutiny on the \nfloor of parliament, often being challenged by the shadow minister who sits on the opposite side of the House. The public can also attend question time, which maintains confidence in the law-making process.\nIn 2017, the Judicial Commission of Victoria was established as an independent body to hear complaints about the conduct of judicial officers and VCAT members. The Commission has the ability to hear complaints from the public or members of the legal profession regarding delays in judgments and courtroom demeanor. The most serious complaints may be referred to a special panel with coercive powers.Did you/uni00A0know?\n338 UNIT 4  THE PEOPLE AND THE LAWStrengths\nSome of the strengths are as follows:\n\u2022 the separation of powers allows for the executive \nto be scrutinised by the legislature. This provides checks and balances in that the legislature as the law-maker can refuse to pass legislation that is inappropriate\n\u2022 the judiciary is independent of the parliament and government. This independence is vital, especially when the Commonwealth is a party in  a case heard before the/uni00A0court\n\u2022 despit e the overlap between the executive power \nand the legislative power, there are still checks between the two.

To abolish the \nprinciple would require a referendum \u2013 a di\ufb03cult outcome to achieve (you will explore referendums \nmore later in this chapter).\nWeaknesses\nSome of the weaknesses are as follows:\n\u2022 in reality, the legislative power and the executive power are combined. This can decrease the \nability of the separation of powers principle to act as a check on each of the powers, as in practice the \npower to administer the law is carried out by the cabinet\n\u2022 wher e the government controls the Senate, there is far less scrutiny that is applied to the laws and \ntherefore the exercise of legislative power, particularly given the legislative power and the executive power are in reality combined\n\u2022 judg es are appointed by the executive. This may result in the perception that the executive is \nin\ufb02uencing the composition of the benches of superior/uni00A0courts (that is, the government of the day can \u2018choose\u2019 which judges they want to hear cases)\n\u2022 the Australian Constitution only provides for separation of powers at a federal level, not at a state level (though the principle of separation of powers exists at a state level as/uni00A0well)\n\u2022 if  the opposition controls the Senate, it can obstruct bills for political gain rather than providing \nauthentic scrutiny.\n10_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   338 10/10/2017   12:31 PM",

In fact, no member of the \nlegislative, executive, or judicial bodies may be a member of any other body.\nVictoria\nIn Victoria, and in other states, there is a  blurring of the principle of separation of powers. The \nprinciple is not enshrined in state  constitutions and is mainly followed as a  matter of convention. \nThe principle is, however,  seen as important and should be followed, although there are  some \nstate  bodies that are  required to  make decisions on dispute (the judicial role) and also make \nregulations (the legislative role).\n10_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   339 6/12/2017   1:47 PM",

These express rights are entrenched in the \nConstitution, meaning that they can only be removed from the Constitution by amending it using the \nreferendum procedure established by Section 128. By comparison, rights that exist at common law and rights created by legislation can be abolished at any time by the Commonwealth Parliament legislating to override/uni00A0them.\nThe \ufb01ve express rights in the Australian Constitution/uni00A0are:\n\u2022 the right to freedom of religion by preventing the Commonwealth from making laws establishing a religion, imposing any form of religious ceremony or worship and prohibiting the exercise of any religion (Section/uni00A0116)\n\u2022 the right to free interstate trade and commerce (Section/uni00A092)\n\u2022 the right to receive \u2018just terms\u2019 when property is acquired by the Commonwealth (Section 51(xxxi))\u2022 the right to trial by jury for indictable Commonwealth o\ufb00ences (Section/uni00A080)\u2022 the right not to be discriminated against on the basis of the state where you reside (Section/uni00A0117).\nThese rights tend to be expressed as limitations on the Commonwealth Parliament in law-making, \nrather than as positive rights for individuals. These \ufb01ve rights are protected because parliament cannot \npass legislation that infringes against the protected rights.\nReligion\nSection 116 of the Australian Constitution states that the Commonwealth Parliament cannot make a law/uni00A0which:\n\u2022 establishes a state religion (that is, declares a particular religion as the o\ufb03cial national religion)\u2022 imposes any religious observance\u2022 pr ohibits the free exercise of any religion (that is, prevents people from practising their religion) \u2013 \nalthough this can be limited because of national security or to ensure that people follow the laws of the \ncountry, as pointed out by Justice Rich in Adelaide Company of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Inc. v Commonwealth (1943) 67 CLR/uni00A0116\n\u2022 requires a religious test as a requirement for holding any Commonwealth o\ufb03ce.express rights \nrights that are stated in the Australian Constitution.

Chief Justice Latham of the High Court pointed out in \nAdelaide Company of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Inc. v Commonwealth that Section 116 also protects non-believers \nby providing for  the right of a person \u2018to  have  no religion\u2019 . However, the High Court has interpreted other \nparts of Section 116 narrowly. As shown in the legal case below, the Commonwealth Government was  \nable to  provide funding to  religious schools.\nChallenging chaplaincy funding\nWilliams v Commonwealth (2012) 248 CLR/uni00A0156\nIn this case, Ronald Williams challenged the Commonwealth Government\u2019s power to  fund a  \nchaplaincy service that was  running in  his children\u2019s government primary school in  Queensland. \nThe Commonwealth Government had entered into a  funding agreement with Scripture Union \nQueensland to  provide chaplaincy services such as \u2018general religious and personal advice to  \nthose seeking it, [and] comfort and support to  students and staff, such as  during times of  grief\u2019. \nThe chaplain was  not to  seek to  \u2018impose any religious beliefs or  persuade an  individual toward  \na particular set of religious beliefs\u2019.\nWilliams argued that the funding agreement was  invalid because it was  beyond the executive \npower of the Commonwealth under Section 61 of the Constitution and/or prohibited by Section 116 of the Constitution. Section 116 states  that \u2018no religious test  shall be required as a  \nqualification for  any office or public trust under the Commonwealth\u2019. Williams argued that the \nschool chaplain is an \u2018office \u2026  under the Commonwealth\u2019 and, further, that there is a  religious \ntest to hold such an office.\nThe High Court unanimously dismissed the challenge under Section 116 relating to  a \n\u2018religious test\u2019 because the chaplains were  not employees of the Commonwealth. The High \nCourt did, however,  find that in the absence of statutory authority, Section 61 did not empower \nthe Commonwealth to  enter into the funding agreement to  make the payments for  the school \nchaplaincy program. In other words, because there was no  act giving authority for  the funding \nagreement, the agreement was invalid. The \nexecutive power of the Commonwealth did not extend to  making such arrangements without \nauthorising legislation.\nImmediately following the High Court\u2019s \ndecision, the parliament passed legislation (the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Act (No. 3)/uni00A0 2012 (Cth)) to  allow the chaplaincy program \nand other similar programs to  be funded by \nthe Commonwealth. Williams challenged the constitutional validity of this legislative change and its  funding arrangements. The High Court \nfound in favour of Williams, declaring that the legislation was  invalid in relation to  the school \nchaplaincy program because it  was  not covered  \nby a specific head of constitutional/uni00A0power.LEGAL  \nCASE\nSource 1 Ronald Williams, who challenged the Federal Government\u2019s \npower  to spend taxpayers\u2019 money on the national school chaplaincy \nprogram.\n10_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   341 10/10/2017   12:31 PM",

Betfair claimed that the legal and practical e\ufb00ect of the fees was  to \nprotect New South Wales wagering operators, particularly TAB  Limited, from competition from wagering \noperators in other states. Betfair challenged the validity of the fee  conditions, arguing that they imposed a \nburden or disadvantage on interstate trade and commerce, contrary to  Section 92 of the Constitution. The  \nHigh Court dismissed the challenge and found that the fees were  imposed on both interstate and intrastate \ntrade (within the state). The  High Court justices emphasised that the focus of Section 92 is on how  a law  \na\ufb00ects interstate trade, not on particular traders.

The Western Australian government argued that the type \nof gambling offered by Betfair, where a  punter could place bets on a  horse to  lose a  race, was  \nnot appropriate. Betfair challenged the validity of  the legislation in  the High Court, arguing that \nit was  inconsistent with Section 92 of  the Australian Constitution, which provides that trade and \ncommerce between the states must be/uni00A0free.\nIn a unanimous decision, the High Court found that the Western Australian legislation was  \ndiscriminatory against a  company that was  incorporated outside of  that state,  so was  therefore \ninvalid.LEGAL  \nCASE\n10_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   342 10/10/2017   12:31 PM",

However, although an independent valuer will decide on what is just terms, this may not be suitable to the seller who is forced to sell his or her property. The High Court has held that property includes both tangible and intangible property, and real (immovable property such as land) and personal (movable property such as goods) property.

The plaintiffs, a  group of tobacco companies, argued that under the Act the \nCommonwealth had acquired their intellectual property rights (e.g. trademarks, copyright \nimages) and this was not on just/uni00A0terms.\nThe High Court held that there was  no acquisition of property by the Commonwealth. The \nCourt recognised that the Act regulated the plaintiff\u2019s intellectual property rights and restricted the plaintiff\u2019s enjoyment of  their rights, but it  did not give a  proprietary benefit or  interest on  the \nCommonwealth or any other person. The High Court distinguished between taking rights and \nacquiring rights.

For example, \nSection 116 prohibits the Commonwealth Parliament from making a law which restricts the free exercise of any religion. In this way, the public is protected against the Parliament being able to make any laws it wants to.\n\u2022 An y person who believes that a law infringes on these rights can take a case to the High Court. The \nHigh Court can then declare the law invalid. This allows for a judicial check on parliament.\n\u2022 Expr ess rights cannot be removed by the Commonwealth Parliament. Only through a referendum \nprocess can the rights be changed or removed. Referendums are di\ufb03cult to pass (see next topic), so this check on parliament in law-making is unlikely to be removed any time soon.\n\u2022 T he High Court can act swiftly in declaring a law ultra vires if a person brings a court action, \nensuring that there is an ability to challenge a Commonwealth law that has been made beyond the power of the parliament.\n\u2022 Expr ess rights are clearly stated in the Australian Constitution and have remained unchanged since \nfederation.

To  make a  tied grant it  \nis necessary for  the Commonwealth Parliament to  pass legislation outlining the grant. This Act \nprescribed the types of  roads to be  built and made arrangements for  maintaining the roads. The \nVictorian Government wanted an unconditional grant. The High Court decided that the Act was  \nvalid and therefore confirmed the right of the Commonwealth Parliament to  make tied grants. \nAs a result of  this case, the Commonwealth is  able to  move  into areas of  residual power such as  \nroad construction because it is able to  give money to  the states  with conditions attached about \nhow that money can be used.LEGAL  \nCASE\nStrengths and weaknesses\nThe role of the High Court in interpreting the Australian Constitution and acting as a check on parliament \nin law-making has a number of strengths and weaknesses. \nStrengths\n\u2022 Judges are  independent of the executive and the legislature and therefore decisions made on cases \nare based on legal principles rather than political pressure.\n\u2022 The existence of the High Court allows individuals who have  an interest in the case to  bring the matter \nto court and have  a law  overturned. This reinforces to  the public that members of parliament are  \nnot above  the law  and judges are  able to  scrutinise laws  made.\n\u2022 The judges of the High Court are  experienced in making decisions, they have  available to  them a wide \nrange of legal resources to  ensure that decisions are  properly made. They  can read broadly in \nterms of international development of legal principles and can ensure, where possible, that Australian \nlaw keeps  pace with these developments. \n\u2022 Where a parliament has made law  outside its power, the High Court can act as an independent \ncheck to  con\ufb01rm whether there has been an abuse  of power. The reasons for  the decision varied among the justices, but in general terms it was  linked \nto the notion of representative government. The justices all indicated that the Constitution \nestablished a  system  of representative government, and that representative government could \nonly operate properly if there was  freedom for  people to  communicate about political issues. \nOtherwise, people would not be fully informed when making choices about who should be elected to  government.\nThe legal case below is an example of the High Court determining whether the tied grants right is \nwithin the Commonwealth Parliament\u2019s law-making power.\n10_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   350 10/10/2017   12:31 PM",

This process is set out in Section 128 of the Australian Constitution.\nThe referendum process acts as a restriction on the powers of parliament, because the Commonwealth \nParliament cannot change the Constitution outside of this process. For example, the wording of the Constitution would have to be changed before Australia could become a republic. The Commonwealth Parliament cannot make this change without referring it to the people. In this way, Section 128 operates as a check on the power of parliament to pass laws that change the Constitution.\nThe procedure for changing the Australian Constitution, as set out in Section 128, has three stages:/uni00A0the \nparliament, the people and the Governor-General. Any proposed change to the Australian Constitution must \ufb01rst be passed by the Commonwealth Parliament. The process has proven to be di\ufb03cult to achieve \u2013 only 8 out of 44 referendums have been successful so far in the history of Australia.\nThe/uni00A0people\nThe Constitution can only be changed after a successful referendum, which is a compulsory vote on a proposed change to the wording of the Australian Constitution.\nThe referendum outlining the proposed change is put to the people not less than two months, and not \nmore than six months, after it has been passed by both houses of the Commonwealth Parliament, or one house/uni00A0twice.\nAll of those electors who are required to vote for the election of members of the House of \nRepresentatives in each state and territory must vote on the referendum.\nBefore the referendum is put to the people, the Australian Electoral Commission sends information to \nevery household that explains the proposed change, and provides arguments for and against it.\nDouble majority provision\nIn the referendum, voters are required to answer \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 to the question asked; for example, \u2018Do you agree to alter the Constitution to insert a preamble?\u2019 For the referendum to be successful, each referendum question must satisfy the double majority provision:\n\u2022 A majority of voters in the whole of Australia (including the territories) must vote/uni00A0\u2018yes\u2019\nAND\n\u2022 A majority of voters in a majority of states must vote \u2018yes\u2019 to the proposed change \u2013 that is, the \nreferendum must be approved by a majority of voters in at least four out of the six states before it is accepted.

The  impact of Section 128 was  seen in a 1977 referendum, the purpose \nof which focused on the term  of service of senators. While the proposal attracted 62.2/uni00A0per cent of  the \nnational vote,  it was  only supported by  the majority vote  in three states, so  the referendum failed. Under \nthe Section 128 processes, each of the states has an equal voice regardless of their size or population.\nIf the proposed change receives a \u2018yes\u2019 vote  from a majority of voters in a majority of the states as \nwell as a majority of  all electors in Australia, it is then presented to  the Governor-General for royal  assent.\nIn the below legal case Section 128 of the Constitution acted as a check on the power of the parliament \nas a law-maker.\nBanning communism\nAustralian Communist Party v Commonwealth (1951) 83/uni00A0CLR/uni00A01\nIn 1950, the Commonwealth Parliament passed the Communist Party Dissolution Act 1950 (Cth), \nwhich had the effect of banning the Communist Party of Australia. \nIn this case, the Communist Party challenged the Act in the High Court, which ruled that \nit was  constitutionally invalid. The High Court found that the Parliament had declared the \nCommunist Party guilty of  \u2018sedition\u2019 and had authorised the executive to  \u2018declare\u2019 individuals or  \ngroups of individuals banned. \nThe majority of the High Court found that the law gave the executive the right to  outlaw an \norganisation without the need to  establish a  factual connection between that organisation and \nany act of subversion. In other words, the High Court ruled that the Commonwealth could not assume that a  person has engaged in illegal activity merely because they are  members of an \norganisation such as a political/uni00A0party.\nFollowing this decision, the Menzies \nGovernment proposed a referendum that would grant the Commonwealth power to  ban the Communist/uni00A0Party.\nWhen the issue was  debated, the \nreferendum question was  opposed by \nthe Communist Party and the Labor Party on the grounds that it would restrict the freedoms of speech and association. When the referendum occurred, the proposal failed, gaining support in  only three states  and winning \n49/uni00A0per cent of the national/uni00A0vote.\nIn this way,  Section 128 operated as \na check on the power of the parliament as a law-maker, in that the public refused to allow the change to the \nConstitution. Further, the referendum only occurred because the High Court rejected the original legislation on the grounds that it was unconstitutional.LEGAL  \nCASEThe number of \nstates  is important to  \ndetermining whether a referendum is passed.

In the High Court case of Rowe v Electoral Commissioner (2010) 243 CLR 1, the requirement that members of the Commonwealth Parliament be \n\u2018directly chosen by the people\u2019 was said to be a \u2018constitutional bedrock\u2019 .\nThe High Court of Australia has often been called on to determine the meaning of Sections 7 and \n24 of the Australian Constitution.

These cases were  Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth \n(1992) 177 CLR 106 and Nationwide News  Pty Ltd v Wills (1992) 177/uni00A0CLR/uni00A01.\nThe Australian Capital Television case dealt with Commonwealth legislation that banned all political \nadvertising on radio and television during election periods (the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures \nAct 1991 (Cth)). This legislation allowed some free advertising to  political parties that already had members \nof parliament. However, it did not allow free or paid time on television or radio for  making political \ncomments in the media. The  High Court held that the legislation was  invalid because the Constitution \nguaranteed a freedom to  discuss matters about politics (see Chapter 10 for  further details on this case).\nThe reasons the High Court justices gave  for the decision varied, but in general terms the implied \nright was  linked to  the idea of representative government. The  justices all indicated that the Constitution \nestablished a system of representative government, and that representative government could only operate \nproperly if there was  freedom for  people to  communicate about political issues. Otherwise, people would \nnot be fully informed when they were  voting in an election.\nCases that confirmed the freedom of political communication\nTheophanous v Herald and Weekly Times Limited (1994) 182 CLR 104 and Lange  v Australian Broadcasting \nCorporation (1997) 189 CLR 520, both High Court cases, have  con\ufb01rmed the existence of the freedom \nof political communication. The  Theophanous case extended the implied freedom to  allow comments \nabout members of parliament and their suitability for  o\ufb03ce. The  Lange  case below went further, saying \nthere was  a permanent freedom of political communication. That  is, the freedom did not just apply \nimmediately before an election. However, the freedom is not a general right to  free speech, but a right to  \nfree communication on matters relating to  political issues.Although the High \nCourt of Australia was established in 1901, the first sitting didn\u2019t take place until 1903 \n(when the Court sat in the Banco Court in the Supreme Court building in Melbourne).

Most of the matters necessary to enable \u2018the \npeople\u2019 to make an informed choice will occur during the period between the holding of one, and the calling of the next, election. If the freedom to receive and disseminate information were confined to election periods, the electors would be deprived of the greater part of the information necessary to make an effective choice at the election.EXTRACTand extended the freedom of political communication, which exist by reason of Sections 7 and 24 of the Constitution. The High Court said that state, territory and Commonwealth legislation and common law must allow for the freedom of political communication implied in the Constitution.\nIn Lange\u2019s case, the High Court developed a two-stage test to determine whether a law \ninfringes the implied freedom of political communication:\n1 Does the law restrict the freedom of political communication about government \nor political matters?\n2 \nIf  yes, is the law reasonably appropriate and adapted to serve a legitimate end that is compatible with the maintenance of representative and responsible government? In other words, is the restriction on political communication reasonable and proportionate, taking into account the objectives of the particular law? If it is not, then the law will be contrary to the Constitution and invalid.\nImportantly, the freedom of political communication is not considered to \nbe a general freedom to communicate. Instead, it operates as a negative right, in that it prevents us from being exposed to laws that stop communication on matters relating to politics and government. The High Court emphasised that the implied freedom is central to our system of representative government in the Constitution. The justices noted that Sections 7 and 24 of the Constitution says members of parliament are \u2018directly chosen by the people\u2019, and that is the basis for this/uni00A0freedom.\nSource 2 David Lange, former \nPrime Minister of New Zealand, sued the ABC in a case that would confirm the right to freedom of political communication.\nThe significance of/uni00A0the Lange/uni00A0case\nThe Lange  case reinforced the implied freedom of communication that had previously been established \nby the High Court from 1992. However, the High Court also established that the freedom is not limited \nto the period during which an election is held. Instead, it held that it was an ongoing freedom as shown in the below extract.\nThe Lange  case is also signi\ufb01cant because it recognised that while the implied freedom of political \ncommunication exists, there are limits that can be placed by the parliament on that freedom. In its judgment, the High Court developed the two-stage test, which a\ufb03rmed the right but also found that it could be appropriate in some circumstances for parliament to limit the freedom. This limitation can occur provided that the law is compatible with the principles of representative government and responsible government.judgment \na statement by the judge at the end of case that outlines the decision and the legal reasoning behind the decision\nrepresentative government a political system in which the people elect members of parliament to represent them in government\n11_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   362 10/10/2017   12:40 PM",

Other than the parliament being able to  restrict the freedom as indicated above,  \nit is not an absolute right to  freedom of speech. Instead, it is a freedom limited to  political communication \nand only to  ensure that the freedom upholds the principles of  representative and responsible government.\nThe 2012 decision in Wotton v Queensland highlights the way  in which the High Court has since applied \nthe test established in the Lange  case.  The  case involved parole conditions that were  imposed on an \no\ufb00ender after he was  released from custody.parole \nthe supervised and conditional release of a prisoner after the minimum period of imprisonment has been served\nApplying the legal principles from the Lange/uni00A0case\nWotton  v Queensland (2012) 246/uni00A0CLR/uni00A01\nThe plaintiff, Lex  Wotton, was  convicted of  rioting \ncausing destruction following a protest on \nPalm Island in 2004 over  the death of another \nAboriginal man in police custody. Wotton served his minimum term of imprisonment and sought parole. In granting parole, the Parole  Board \nimposed 22 conditions on Wotton under Section 200(2) of the Corrective Services Act 2006 (Qld), \nwhich included prohibiting him from attending public meetings on  Palm Island without the prior \napproval of the corrective services officer, having any interaction with the media, or receiving any direct or indirect payment or benefit from the/uni00A0media.\nWotton was  also subject to  Section 132(1)\n(a) of the Corrective Services Act, which made it \nan offence for  a person to  interview or obtain a  \nstatement from a prisoner (including parolees).\nWotton challenged the constitutional validity \nof sections 132(1)(a) and 200(2), arguing that they burdened the implied freedom of political \ncommunication about government and political matters. The High Court applied the test  set \ndown in the Lange case and held that the sections in question did burden freedom of political \ncommunication about government or political matters (stage 1), but that these sections were  \nreasonably appropriate and adapted to  serve a  legitimate end compatible with the system  of \ngovernment; that is, community safety and crime prevention through humane containment, supervision and rehabilitation of  offenders, and to  ensure the good conduct of  parolees (stage/uni00A02). \nTherefore, the High Court held that the sections of the Corrective Services Act were not invalid.

In the letters, Monis \ncriticised Australia's involvement in the conflict. As a  result, he was  charged under Section \n471.12 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code for  the crime of using a  postal service in a  \nway that \u2018reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, menacing, \nharassing or offensive\u2019. Monis challenged the constitutional validity of that section on the grounds that it infringed upon the implied freedom of political communication.\nThe key  issue in the Monis case was  the circumstances in which it \nis considered reasonable for  the law to  place limits on the freedom of  \npolitical communication. The case focused on  the second stage of  the \ntest established by the High Court in the Lange/uni00A0case.\nThe final decision in the Monis case was  split 3:3. While all \nsix judges of the High Court held that Section 471.12 restricted political communication, they were  divided on whether that section \nwas compatible with the system  of representative and responsible \ngovernment. Three of  the judges ruled that the intention of  parliament \nto protect the privacy of an  individual in  their own  home when receiving \npersonally addressed mail was  reasonable and proportionate. The \nHigh Court justices focused on the main intention of Section 471.12, which is to  protect individuals from \u2018intrusion into their personal \ndomain of unsolicited material which is seriously offensive\u2019. The focus of the legislation was  whether \u2018reasonable persons\u2019 would find \nthe sending of this material by post to  be offensive.

Vickie Lee Roach, who was  serving a  six-year term of imprisonment for  \nfive offences, was  enrolled to  vote  in the seat of Kooyong, Victoria. Under the previous Act made  \nin 2004, prisoners who were  serving sentences longer than three years were  banned from voting;  \nthe 2006 Act extended this ban so that no sentenced prisoners could vote. At the time, there were  \naround 20/uni00A0000 prisoners in Australia who would be affected by the/uni00A0Act.\nRoach challenged the constitutional validity of both Acts in  \nthe High Court.  \nThe High Court held that the 2006 Act was  inconsistent  \nwith the system  of representative democracy established by  \nthe Constitution. It found that the Act was  unconstitutional  \nbecause Sections 7  and 24 of the Australian Constitution,  \nwhich require that parliament be chosen \u2018directly by the \npeople\u2019, legally protect the right of the people to  choose the  \nmembers of parliament.\nThe principle of  representative government, which protects  \nthe right of the people to  directly choose the parliament, gives  \npeople a  right to  vote  for those who govern the country, so the  \nparliament should only be able to  restrict a  person\u2019s right to  \nvote if it is necessary to  preserve representative government.  \nGood enough reasons might include unsoundness of mind,  \nconviction of treason, or committing serious criminal misconduct. In the High Court ruling Chief  \nJustice Gleeson stated  that the right to  vote  could be removed for  serious criminal misconduct  \n(e.g. for  prisoners serving a  sentence of more than three years) but could not be removed for  \nprisoners who had been sentenced for less serious criminal offences.\nThe High Court ruled that while the 2004 legislation (banning prisoners serving three years or  \nmore from voting) was  valid, it was  unconstitutional for  all sentenced prisoners to  be denied the  \nright to vote. People  serving short-term sentences were  generally not involved in  serious criminal  \nmisconduct; therefore this section of the Act was declared invalid by the High Court.  \nInterestingly, as  Roach  was  sentenced to a  six-year term of  imprisonment, she still did not have  \nthe right to  vote after the High Court decision.LEGAL  \nCASE\nSource 5 While in jail, Vickie Lee Roach completed a \nmaster\u2019s degree in professional writing and commenced studies for a PhD.\nThe significance of/uni00A0the Roach/uni00A0case\nThis case upheld the fundamental requirement that members of the Commonwealth Parliament must  \nbe directly chosen by  the people. It found that the Commonwealth Parliament had acted beyond its  \npower (unconstitutionally) by  denying certain prisoners the right to  vote.  Some legal commentators have  \ninterpreted this decision as implying a  \u2018right to  vote\u2019 in the Constitution, and that this right can only be  \nlimited for  a \u2018substantial reason\u2019 . Others see the High Court as being cautious about directly stating that  \nthere is an implied right to  vote.  Regardless it is clear that the High Court has held that Sections 7  and 24 do  \nnot allow for  unreasonable restrictions on the ability of the people to  choose the members of parliament.\n11_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   365 10/10/2017   12:40 PM",

However, any  limitation must be \nfor appropriate reasons.\nThe signi\ufb01cance of the Roach case was  con\ufb01rmed by  the High Court in the 2010 case of  Rowe  v \nElectoral Commissioner./uni00A0This case involved a challenge to  the validity of provisions of  the Electoral and \nReferendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Act . The  Act had reduced the time between \nannouncing a general election and closing o\ufb00 the electoral roll (i.e. the list of registered voters). Before the \n2006 amendment, new electors could enrol with the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), and existing electors could change their details, at  any time up to  seven  days  after the issue of the writs for  an election. \nHowever, the 2006 Act  stated that new enrolments and re-enrolments had to  be received by  the AEC  by \n8:00 pm on the day  the election writs were  issued, and changes to  enrolment details could only be made \nup to  three days  after the issue of the writs. The  High Court held that the sections were  invalid as they \ncontravened Sections 7 and 24 of the Constitution. Justice Crennan held that the democratic right to  vote  \nis supported and protected by  the Constitution.\nThe High Court has recently looked again at  the principles of  law created in both the Roach case and \nthe Rowe  case.  The case of  Murphy v Electoral Commissioner (2016) 334 ALR 369 is an example of the way  \ncourts balance di\ufb00erent interests to  achieve a just outcome.

The  plaintiffs,  led by activist  \nAnthony  Murphy,  argued  that  the electoral  rolls  should  be open  right  up to polling day.  \nThey  argued  that the current  law,  which  closes  the electoral  rolls  earlier, contravenes  the \nprinciples of  representative government  contained  in Sections  7 and  24 of the Australian  \nConstitution.  They  claimed that the process,  which  \nis operated  by the AEC,  results in some  voters  being \ndenied the  opportunity  to vote  if they try  to enrol once  \nthe electoral  rolls have closed.\nThe plaintiffs argued  that  technological improvements  \nover the  past  decade  mean there  is no valid  reason  to \nsuspend  the electoral  rolls from  seven  days  after  the \nissue  of the writs  for an election.  They  cited  the Roach  \ncase,  claiming that the  closure  of the  electoral  rolls well  \nbefore  polling  day placed  a substantial and unnecessary  \nburden  on the constitutional  principle of choice  of \ncandidates  by the people.\nIn response,  the Commonwealth argued/uni00A0that among  \nother things  it had  the power  to design  an electoral  \nsystem  that  gives  Australians the  right  to vote,  and  as \nlong  as people  acted  within the timeframe  set by the  \nAEC,  nobody  was excluded  from exercising that  right.LEGAL  \nCASE\nSource 6 In the Murphy case, the plaintiffs challenged the validity of provisions contained within the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth), arguing that they were contrary to  \nSections 7 and 24 of the Constitution.\n11_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   366 10/10/2017   12:41 PM",

  "Page 380": "368 UNIT 4  THE PEOPLE AND THE LAWREFERENDUMS 11.2  \nWhen the Australian Constitution was written, safeguards were put in place to ensure that the \nCommonwealth Parliament could not change the wording of the document without \ufb01rst seeking the permission of the Australian people (i.e. voters). This was based on democratic principles that respected the right of voters to be involved in any process that would change the way the nation is governed.\nIn Chapter/uni00A0 10, you looked at the referendum  process, which is used to change the words of \nthe Australian Constitution. In particular, you learnt about the double majority requirement that is necessary for a change to the Constitution to/uni00A0occur.\nAs a result of the strict nature of the double majority  requirement, actual changes to the wording \nof the Australian Constitution have been rare. Since federation, a total of 44 referendum proposals have been put to the people. Of those 44, the Australian people have only voted eight times in favour of changing the words of the Constitution. \nThe referendum process not only enables the Australian people to change the Australian \nConstitution (by voting \u2018yes\u2019 to a change), but also enables them to protect the Constitution (by voting/uni00A0\u2018no\u2019).\nProtecting the/uni00A0Australian Constitution\nOne of the main functions of Section 128 is to prevent the Commonwealth from increasing its powers without \ufb01rst referring the proposal to the people in a referendum. This ensures voters have a direct say in whether the wording of the Constitution will be changed. As noted in Chapter/uni00A010, the referendum process gives the states equal voting rights on referendums, in that any proposal must be supported by a majority of voters in a majority of states. This o\ufb00ers a signi\ufb01cant protection to the residents of the smaller states, in that their voices have equal weight in the referendum process as their neighbours in other larger states such as New South Wales and Victoria.\nThe most recent referendum which was rejected by the Australian people was in 1999, which \nrequired the people to decide whether Australia would become a republic. Rejecting a referendum can be a way of protecting the Constitution, as it means the Australian people have said no to a change. They are preserving the Constitution in its existing/uni00A0form.\nThe 1999 referendum on/uni00A0the republic\nIn the early 1990s, then prime minister Paul Keating expressed a desire for a republic in time for the Centenary of Federation (1 January 2001). The Coalition  parties, led by John Howard, won the 1996 \nelection and established a Constitutional Convention. The 1998 Constitutional Convention\u2019s role was to debate the proposed change to the Constitution which would remove the monarchy as Australia\u2019s head of state. A/uni00A0majority of those attending the Convention agreed on a proposal that was put to the people on 6 November/uni00A01999.\nProposals put to/uni00A0the/uni00A0people\nThe proposal included two changes to the wording of the Constitution. The \ufb01rst proposal was for Australia to become a republic , and the second was to change the preamble  to the Constitution. \nTwo bills  had been passed by both houses of the Commonwealth Parliament to allow the proposals \nto be put to the people.referendum \nthe method used for changing the wording of the Australian Constitution.

They would add \nnothing to the already democratic character of Australia.\nThey will not enhance our independence.EXTRACTWhen it became clear \nthat the proposal to make Australia a republic would fail, a disappointed Malcolm Turnbull conceded defeat on behalf of the Australian Republican Movement. He reflected on the challenges of what had been a nine-year campaign. Seventeen years later, as Prime Minister, he reaffirmed his commitment to a republic but said he would only support a referendum after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II had/uni00A0ended.Did you/uni00A0know?\u2022 P ublic opinion on the introduction of a president varied. Traditional monarchists argued that a \nconstitutional monarchy provides stable government. This encouraged those in doubt to maintain \nthe status quo of a constitutional monarchy .\n\u2022 M any people who would usually support a republic voted \u2018no\u2019 because they believed that the \npresident should be elected by the people rather than being chosen by a two-thirds majority of the Commonwealth Parliament. Some voters regarded the model put forward to be undemocratic and wanted a choice in the selection of the president.\n\u2022 In the weeks before the referendum, then prime minister John Howard of the Liberal Party urged \na \u2018no\u2019 vote on the grounds of maintaining ties to Britain, which had stood the test of time. This argument swayed some undecided voters to vote \u2018no\u2019, especially those who would normally support the Liberal Party. Given that a referendum proposal can be confusing for many voters, people are more likely to look to their political leaders for guidance when making their decision, especially if that advice is from the prime minister.constitutional \nmonarchy a system of government in which a monarch (i.e. a king or queen) is the head of state and a parliament makes the laws under the terms of a constitution\n11_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   370 10/10/2017   12:41 PM",

It had stood the test of/uni00A0time.\nThe 1999 referendum highlights the \nimportance of Section 128 of the Australian Constitution in requiring that the people support such a change, which would have amended fundamental elements of our legal system. It serves as an example of how democratic processes, including the requirement under Section 128 for a double majority, allow the people to have the \ufb01nal say on constitutional reform. This enhances con\ufb01dence in the legal system, especially in a referendum such as this, which would have substantially changed the way that Australia is governed.\nOn the other hand, perhaps the referendum failed because of factors such as reluctance among \nvoters for change, a lack of bipartisan support (support from both major parties), and a lack of understanding about the proposals.

When the Constitution was being negotiated, people were not thinking about broader social needs, and these pensions were the only two items mentioned. \nAs Australia moved through the Second World War, society was changing.

The Coalition government of the time, led by prime minister Harold Holt, held a referendum on whether the Commonwealth Parliament should have powers in respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.\nProposals put to/uni00A0the/uni00A0people\nTwo proposals were put to the electors for a proposed change in/uni00A01967:\n\u2022 A proposal under the Constitution Alteration (Parliament) Bill 1967 (Cth) to alter the Constitution \nso that the number of members of the House of Representatives could be increased without \nnecessarily increasing the number of senators.\n\u2022 A proposal under the Constitution Alteration (Aboriginals) Bill 1967 (Cth) to remove any ground for the belief that the Constitution discriminated against people of the Aboriginal race, and, at the same time, to make it possible for the Commonwealth Parliament to enact special laws for these people.\nThe two questions put to the people on the second proposal involved whether Indigenous people \nshould be included in the national census and whether the Commonwealth Parliament should be allowed \nto create law regarding \u2018People of the Aboriginal Race\u2019 . This referend\num, if passed, made the authority \nto legislate with regard to Australia\u2019s indigenous people a concurrent power, where previously it had been a residual/uni00A0power.\nReferendum results\nThe majority of voters in Australia voted in favour of the referendum. Across the whole of Australia, 90.77 per cent of voters were in favour and only 9.23 per cent against.\nDespite the fact that this referendum was held at the same time as an unsuccessful referendum \n(being the referendum about the increase of numbers in the House of Representatives), it was accepted \nwith the highest \u2018yes\u2019 vote to date. This vote was said to have re\ufb02ected a general community view that it was time to make amends to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, although the state with the largest Indigenous population (Western Australia) as a percentage of the population, recorded the largest \u2018no\u2019 vote (19.05/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent).House of \nRepresentatives the lower house of the Commonwealth Parliament\nSource 5 The ballot paper for the 1967 referendumof any race, other than the aboriginal race in any State, for whom it is deemed necessary to \nmake special/uni00A0laws.\u2019\n127 Aborigines not to be counted in reckoning population\nS127 Aborigines not to be counted in reckoning population\nIn reckoning the numbers of people of the Commonwealth, or of a State or other part of \nthe Commonwealth, aboriginal natives shall not be counted.\n11_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   373 10/10/2017   12:41 PM",

Much of the debate in 1967 focused on the need to recognise Indigenous Australians in the national census, and the bene\ufb01  ts of having the Commonwealth legislate for the changing needs of Indigenous people. The overwhelming support across all states for these proposals, as well as at the national vote, highlighted the importance of the referendum process in being able to allow the views and values of the public to be re\ufb02  ected in constitutional change.    \n  Although the Commonwealth did little in this policy area for the \ufb01  rst \ufb01  ve years, it was seen as extremely \nimportant for Indigenous people.

The Commonwealth Parliament had \npassed the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905 (Cth) requiring all owners of wireless sets (radios) to  \nhold a licence. The defendant was charged with not holding a licence.\nProceedings in the Court of Petty Sessions, Sydney/uni00A01934\nThe evidence showed that officers of the Postmaster-General\u2019s Department visited the defendant\u2019s premises on 26 September 1934 and found there a  five-valve all-electric wireless \nreceiving set connected to an  indoor aerial. On  the following day,  the defendant admitted to  the \nofficers that she owned the wireless receiving set, that it had been installed for  a week, and \nthat she had no  current wireless listener\u2019s licence. The defendant was  charged and convicted. \nThe defendant challenged the validity of  the Wireless Telegraphy Act in the High Court, stating \nthat broadcasting to  a wireless set is NOT  a service in the sense in which that term is used \nin Section 51(v). A/uni00A0\u2018wireless set\u2019 was  not mentioned in the Constitution and did not fit within \nSection 51(v). Therefore, the section of the Wireless Telegraphy Act requiring people who had a  \nwireless set to  have a  licence was  invalid.

After this decision, the Commonwealth Parliament had the power to make laws with respect to broadcasting to wireless sets. If a state passed a law in this area, and there was a con\ufb02  ict between the state law and the Commonwealth law, the Commonwealth law would prevail in accordance with Section 109 of the Australian Constitution.  \n  Since the decision in the  Brislan  case, electronic technology has boomed. The Commonwealth has \nassumed control of electronic means of communication, with the term \u2018other like services\u2019 being read broadly. For example, the  Interactive Gambling Act 2001   (Cth) regulates the advertising and promotion \nof live sports wagering available over the internet. The authority of the Commonwealth to create law in this area is based on its powers under Section/uni00A051(v).  \n  Since the 1920s, the changing balance between state and federal law-making power has generally \nbeen in favour of the Commonwealth. This has weakened the states\u2019 rights to make laws in some areas that were once considered residual powers . Under the Australian Constitution, \nwhere the Commonwealth can show it has power over a certain area, its laws will prevail over con\ufb02  icting state/uni00A0laws.   \nEach time the High Court \ufb01  nds in favour \nof Commonwealth law-making power in cases involving the Constitution, this balance tips further towards the Commonwealth. For those who like centralised government and the consistency found in uniform laws, that is a good thing. Others like to see di\ufb00  erences between the states and argue that law-making power should be distributed more broadly. The di\ufb03   culty with this approach, however, is that laws tend to di\ufb00  er between the states.\nresidual powers\npowers that were not given to the Commonwealth Parliament under the Australian Constitution and which therefore remain with the states (as opposed to concurrent powers and exclusive powers)\nSource 2 Television was invented in the 1930s, long after federation in Australia. As a result, the High Court has been called upon to decide whether the Constitution gives the Commonwealth Parliament the power to make law in this/uni00A0area.The Commonwealth Parliament has moved to impose limits on television advertising by gambling companies, although the television industry was upset by this shift in policy. The major networks rely on revenue from the gambling industry, which spent almost $150/uni00A0million on wagering and lottery advertisements in 2016. This power of the Commonwealth can be traced back to the High Court decision in the Brislan/uni00A0case.Did you/uni00A0know?Comments by the High Court in Brislan\u2019s/uni00A0Case\nIn his judgment, Chief Justice Latham stated:\nThe common characteristic of postal, telegraphic and telephonic \nservices, which is relevant in this connection is, in my opinion, to be found \nin the function which they perform. They are, each of them, communication services. This is also the characteristic of a broadcasting service in all its forms, which is therefore, in my opinion, a \u2018like service\u2019 within the meaning of Section 51(v) of the Constitution. If a new form of communication should be discovered, it too might be made the subject of legislation as a \u2018like service\u2019.\nThe High Court interpreted the term \u2018other like services\u2019 in Section 51(v) \nto include broadcasting to wireless sets. This case changed the division of \nlaw-making powers by extending the Commonwealth Parliament\u2019s power to legislate regarding postal, telegraphic, telephonic and other like services to include broadcasting to wireless sets. \n Source 1 Wireless sets like this were \ncommon in homes during the 1930s in Australia.\n11_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   377 10/10/2017   12:41 PM",

This has led to  the states becoming more reliant on the Commonwealth Parliament \nto levy taxes for  them, thus eroding the \ufb01nancial independence of the states.\nIn deciding that a number of  state  laws  imposing licence fees on retailers and wholesalers of tobacco \nwas inconsistent with the Australian Constitution, the High Court e\ufb00ectively deprived the states of  \napproximately 16 per cent of the taxes that they collect. An important e\ufb00ect of the High Court ruling was  \nto further entrench the Commonwealth\u2019s control over  the national economy.\nThe impact of the decision in the Ha case can be seen more clearly when you  consider the e\ufb00ects \non a state  being unable to  pass laws  that raise money, or having to  spend its money in the way  the \nCommonwealth prefers (that is,  through tied grants). This further reduces the capacity of the states to  \nundertake planning for  the future.\nThe WorkChoices/uni00A0case\nOne area where the state  and Commonwealth Governments have  disagreed about laws  is workplace \nrelations (being laws  about employment, wages  and work  conditions, and workers\u2019 rights).

The plaintiffs argued that these fees were  excise duties, which states  were  \nnot empowered to  impose because the Commonwealth had exclusive power in this area of \nlaw-making.\nThe High Court in Ha v  New  South Wales had to  interpret the meaning of excise duties in \nSection 90 of the Constitution. By  a 4:3 majority, the High Court ruled that the fees charged by \nthe NSW Government were  excise duties, and so were  unconstitutional, as the power to  levy  \nthese fees was exclusive to  the Commonwealth Parliament.LEGAL\nCASE\n11_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   378 10/10/2017   12:41 PM",

This \nis known as the corporations power.\n\u2022 The states  and trade unions argued in response that this was  a grab for  power by the \nCommonwealth, which was interpreting the corporations power too broadly.\nThe Commonwealth had relied on  the corporations power in  section 51(xx) of  the Constitution \nwhen passing the Act. The plaintiffs argued that the corporations power was  limited to  \nrelationships between corporations and external entities, and not internal relationships such as between a  corporation and its  employees. The High Court decided, in a  5:2 majority, that \nthe legislation was  valid and that the corporations power gave the Commonwealth Parliament \npower in  relation to  both internal and external relationships in a  constitutional corporation. This \nwas a landmark case because it  gave the Commonwealth much greater control over  workplaces \nacross the nation.

Over  the past  three  decades,  the external  a\ufb00airs  power  \nhas been  relied  on by the Commonwealth  Parliament  to pass  legislation  that re\ufb02ects  international  \nagreements  that Australia  has entered  into.  \nIn various  cases,  the High  Court  has decided  that the external  a\ufb00airs  power  includes  \nauthority to  legislate  to give  e\ufb00ect  to an international  agreement  such  as a treaty.  This  gives  the \nCommonwealth  Parliament  the ability  to make  laws  on treaty topics  that are  not listed  as powers  in \nthe Constitution.  It can potentially  legislate  on a residual  power  if the treaty topic  covers  that area.  \nBefore  considering  a series  of High  Court  cases,  it is useful  to understand  the basics  of international  \ntreaties  and declarations. \nInternational  treaties and declarations\nAustralia  is an active  member  of the international  community.

In  a global  community,  these  agreements are  an important focus  of government  policy.  Two  \ntypes  of agreements are  treaties  and declarations.\nInternational treaties\nAn international  treaty  (i.e. an international  convention)  is a binding  agreement between  countries  \nand is governed  by international law.  A treaty can  be bilateral (between  two  countries  only)  or \nmultilateral  (between three  or more countries).  It can also  include  organisations as  parties.  \nA multilateral  treaty is  generally  developed  through  international  organisations such  as the \nUnited  Nations. An  example  of a  treaty is  the Convention  Concerning  the Protection  of the World  \nCultural  and Natural  Heritage , adopted  by the General  Conference  of UNESCO  in 1972.

Our government enters into agreements with other nations in key areas such as trade, environmental protection and human rights. In a global community, these agreements are an important focus of government policy. Two types of agreements are treaties and declarations.\nInternational treaties\nAn international  treaty  (i.e. an international convention) is a binding agreement between countries \nand is governed by international law. A treaty can be bilateral (between two countries only) or multilateral (between three or more countries). It can also include organisations as parties. \nA multilateral treaty is generally developed through international organisations such as the \nUnited Nations. An example of a treaty is the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage , adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO in 1972. The terms of \nthis convention have been in\ufb02uential in shaping policy on the environment since the 1980s.\nIn our globalised world, there needs to be international cooperation in areas such as trade, \nhuman rights and the environment.

It \ncan only apply in Australia if the parliament passes \na statute that includes the provisions set out in the treaty. The  statute is then interpreted by  the courts \nin Australia. \nInternational declarations \nIn contrast to  a treaty, an international declaration \nis a non-binding agreement between countries which sets out certain \u2018aspirations\u2019 or \u2018intentions\u2019 of the parties to  the agreement. Declarations can \nbe in\ufb02uential in the development of government policy. They  can ultimately lead to  a treaty being \nmade, such as in the case of the United Nations \nConvention on the Rights of the Child.

Since  the 1980s,  the High  Court  has considered  \na number  of international  agreements  signed  by Australia.  In a series  of cases,  the High  Court  has \ninterpreted  the term  \u2018external  a\ufb00airs\u2019  as giving  power  to the Commonwealth  Parliament  to pass  \nlegislation  to give  e\ufb00ect  to obligations or rights under  international  law. \nThe Tasmanian Dam  case\nIn the case  of the  Commonwealth  v Tasmania  (1983)  158 CLR  1 (below),  the High  Court  was required  to \ninterpret the  words  \u2018external  a\ufb00airs\u2019  in Section  51(xxix)  of the  Constitution.international \ndeclaration a non-binding agreement between countries which set out certain aspirations of the parties to  the \nagreement\nSource 2 The UN Convention on the Rights of \nthe Child applies to  all children regardless of \nrace, religion, abilities, political views or family circumstances.

This was  a domestic issue for  Tasmania that was  \nwithin its  law-making power (that is, a  residual power). The Tasmanian Parliament passed the \nGordon River Hydro-Electric Power  Development Act 1982 (Tas) to  set up  the hydroelectric power \nscheme and the Franklin River dam.\nAustralia-wide protests occurred as a  result of the Tasmanian Government\u2019s intention to  \nbuild a  dam, causing the Commonwealth Government to  intervene in an area of state  power. \nThe state  of Tasmania maintained that it  had the right to  make laws concerning the dam, which \nwas a state  issue.LEGAL\nCASE\n11_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   382 10/10/2017   12:41 PM",
  "Page 395": "383  CHAPTER/uni00A011  CHANGING AND PROTECTING THE AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTIONSignificance of the Tasmanian Dam case\nThrough the High Court\u2019s interpretation of Section 51(xxix) of the Constitution, the \nCommonwealth Parliament was able to move into a law-making area previously left with the states. This increased the law-making power of the Commonwealth Parliament. This could also lead to the Commonwealth Parliament assuming power over other issues involving international treaties, such as human rights, which comes under the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\nThe decision in the Tasmanian Dam case was considered by the High Court \n\ufb01ve years later in the case of Richardson v Forestry Commission of Tasmania (1988) 164 CLR 261. This case considered the same convention as that in the Tasmanian Dam case. In this case, the High Court again interpreted the external a\ufb00airs \npower as allowing the Commonwealth Parliament to pass laws which ful\ufb01lled an international obligation. Intervention by the Commonwealth Parliament\nThe Commonwealth Parliament maintained that it had a duty to stop work likely to damage or destroy Australia\u2019s national heritage. The area covered by the proposed dam was nominated by the Fraser Government in 1981 as an area to be placed on the World Heritage List; UNESCO included the area on the List in 1982. According to UNESCO, the Convention Concerning \nthe Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage \u2018links together in a single document the concepts of nature conservation and the preservation of cultural properties. The Convention recognises the way in which people interact with nature, and the fundamental need to preserve the balance between the two.\u2019\nThe World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983 (Cth) was passed \nto prohibit construction of the proposed dam. This legislation was based on the core principles of the above convention in seeking to protect fragile wilderness regions. In response, the Tasmanian Government argued that the Commonwealth Parliament had passed law in an area of state responsibility and the Commonwealth law was unconstitutional. The Commonwealth responded that it had the power to intervene because its \u2018external affairs\u2019 power gave it authority to make laws relating to an issue covered by World Heritage listing (an international/uni00A0treaty).\nDecision of the High Court\nThe High Court decided that as all aspects of Australia\u2019s relationships with other countries are included under the external affairs power, and because the Franklin River area was covered by an international treaty, it too came under the external affairs power. This decision interpreted the words \u2018external affairs\u2019 to include any area covered by an international treaty.\nAs a result of this decision there was inconsistency between the World Heritage Properties \nConservation Act and the Gordon River Hydro-Electric Power Development Act. Under Section 109, \nthe Commonwealth Act prevailed and the Gordon River Hydro-Electric Power Development Act \nwas made inoperable as far as the building of the dam was concerned because the Act was in conflict with the Commonwealth Act.\nSource 3 The front page of The \nExaminer, a daily newspaper in \nTasmania, 2 July 1983.\nSource 4 A protest against the damming of \nthe Franklin River\n11_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   383 10/10/2017   12:41 PM",
  "Page 396": "384 UNIT  4 THE PEOPLE AND THE  LAWThe Lemonthyme Forest case \nRichardson v Forestry Commission of  Tasmania (1988) 164 CLR 261\nFacts of the case\nThis case involved a  consideration of the Commonwealth Parliament\u2019s external affairs power \nin light of its  implementation of the Convention Concerning the Protection of  the World Cultural \nand Natural Heritage (Convention). One of the objectives of the Convention was to  identify and \nprotect areas of World Heritage.\nThe High Court in this case looked at the validity of the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests  \n(Commission of  Inquiry) Act 1987 (Cth), which established a  Commission of Inquiry into an area \nof the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests  in western Tasmania. The role  of the Commission \nwas to  determine whether a  particular part of the forests (known as the \u2018protected area\u2019) was  \nor contributed to  a World Heritage area. The objective of the Lemonthyme Act was to  provide \nmeasures that would give effect to  Australia\u2019s obligations under the Convention.\nIn this action the plaintiff, who was the \nfederal Minister for  the Environment and the \nArts, and was  responsible for  the administration \nof the Lemonthyme Act, tried to enforce \nSections 16(1) and (2) o f  that Act which prohibited, \nexcept  with the written consent of the Minister, \ncertain acts (including timber harvesting) in the protected area during an interim protection period. The interim protection period was  a \nspecified time period during which no works \ncould occur in the protected area until a  final \ndecision was  made regarding World Heritage \nprotection.\nThe defendants wanted works i n  the protected \narea to  continue. Lawyers for  the defendants \nargued that this was  not a  legitimate use of the \nConvention and therefore the Commonwealth law was/uni00A0invalid.\nThe central issue was whether the \nLemonthyme Act was invalid, and therefore \nwhether the plaintiff could prevent harvesting while the Commission of Inquiry took place. \nThe decision of the High Court\nThe High Court held that the Lemonthyme Act was supported by the external affairs power. \nIt stated  that the Convention was  aimed to  ensure that measures were  taken to  protect and \nconserve \nthe cultural and natural heritage of certain areas. The High Court found that as the \nConvention required parties to  identify areas for  protection, it allowed the Commonwealth to  \nestablish an interim protection period to  operate until a  decision was  made regarding World \nHeritage protection.  \nThe High Court found that Article 5  of the Convention places a  duty on signatories to  \n\u2018endeavour, in so far as  possible, and as  appropriate for  each country \u2026 to take  appropriate legal, LEGAL\nCASE\nSource 5 The role of the Commission was to  determine whether \na particular part of the forest was (or contributed to) a World \nHeritage area.\n11_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   384 10/10/2017   12:41 PM",
  "Page 397": "385  CHAPTER/uni00A011  CHANGING AND  PROTECTING THE AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTIONSignificance of the Lemonthyme Forests case\nConsistent with the decision in the Tasmanian Dam case,  the High Court held that the legislation passed \nby the Commonwealth Parliament was  supported by  Section 51(xxix) of the Australian Constitution, \nbeing the power to  legislate with respect to  external a\ufb00airs. As the relevant international convention \nrequired parties to  identify and protect areas which were  considered appropriate to  have  World Heritage \nprotection, the High Court considered that establishing a commission to  identify those areas was  within \nthe power of the Commonwealth Parliament. \nIn particular, the High Court found that the Tasmanian Dam case established that if the Commonwealth \nParliament passes legislation with the objective of discharging an international obligation (contained in an \ninternational convention), then it has the choice as to  how  the law  achieves that objective, so long as the \nlaw is appropriate and adapted to  attain that objective.\nOther High Court cases involving the interpretation of the external a\ufb00airs power are  set out below.

It \nis only by taking those measures that the risk of failing to  discharge the Convention obligation \ncan be avoided.\u2019\nThe justices made clear, consistent with the majority views in  the Tasmanian Dam case, that \nif the Commonwealth Parliament enacts legislation to  discharge an international obligation, \nthen the Parliament can choose how that international obligation is discharged, so long as the \nlegislation is appropriate and adapted to  carry out that purpose. The High Court therefore \nupheld the right of the Commonwealth Parliament to  legislate to  protect the area in question.\nSeas and Submerged Lands case \nNew  South Wales v Commonwealth (1975) 135 CLR 337\nIn the case of New  South Wales v  Commonwealth, an issue arose about whether the \nCommonwealth Parliament\u2019s external affairs power gave it power to  pass legislation with \nrespect to  territorial/uni00A0seas.\nThe law in question was  the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973 (Cth), a  Commonwealth \nstatute which provided the Commonwealth with sovereign rights over  the continental shelf (the \nseabed and subsoil of certain submarine areas) for  the purpose of exploring it and exploiting \nits natural resources. This also included sovereignty over  a belt of sea adjacent to  the coast \nof Australia, and the airspace over  that sea, the seabed and subsoil of the sea. The Act gave \neffect to two  international conventions: the 1958 Convention on the Territorial Sea and the \nContiguous Zone, and the 1958 Convention on the Continental Shelf, both ratified by Australia. \nBoth conventions made available to  Australia sovereignty and sovereign rights to  these areas. \nAll of the states challenged the legislation in the High Court, claiming it was invalid.

After the  German  invasion of the Soviet  \nUnion  in 1941,  Ukraine  was occupied by Nazi  troops.  In the  process,  some  Ukrainian citizens  \ncollaborated  with the  German  Army  (i.e. they  cooperated  with the  enemy).

Further allegations were  made  about the  \nexecutions  of civilians in August and September 1942.

It held that \u2018mere geographic externality\u2019 was sufficient to allow the Commonwealth Parliament to exercise its external affairs power. In other words, the fact that the deaths occurred outside Australia made the investigation and prosecution of the alleged offences an \u2018external affair\u2019 that fell within the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament. \nThe High Court also found that the War Crimes Amendment Act \nwas consistent with Article 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which states that \u2018Nothing in this article shall prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which, at the time when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles of law recognized by the community of nations\u2019.

The court has adopted a broad interpretation of the external a\ufb00airs power and held that it enables the Commonwealth Parliament to enact legislation, the objective of which is to give e\ufb00ect to obligations found in international law. \nHigh Court interpretations of the external a\ufb00airs power in relation to international obligations \nhave therefore expanded and broadened what \u2018external a\ufb00airs\u2019 means. The impact of the High Court\u2019s interpretation of the power includes as follows:\n\u2022 T he cases highlight the way the external a\ufb00airs power can be applied to any matter that is contained \nin an international document such as a treaty or declaration. This allows the Commonwealth to \ncreate law to address global concerns. \n\u2022 The Tasmanian Dam  case and the Lemonthyme Forest case, among others, uphold the idea that the \nCommonwealth Parliament is able to legislate in areas in which it has no express constitutional power if it were to give e\ufb00ect to its international obligations. For example, environment is an area of residual power, but in both these cases, the Commonwealth Parliament was able to legislate in this area where it was giving e\ufb00ect to obligations set out in an international treaty.  \n\u2022 T he legal principles in the Tasmanian Dam case were a\ufb03rmed by the High Court in the Lemonthyme \nForests case. In particular, in that case, the majority held that it was a matter for the Commonwealth \nParliament to decide how to give e\ufb00ect to a treaty, so long as the means used was appropriate. \n\u2022 The Seas and Submerged Lands case  highlights the view of the High Court that the Commonwealth \ncould legislate in relation to areas within its territorial waters. Australia was signatory to United Nations conventions in relation to sovereignty and sovereign rights over certain areas.At the time of the \nSecond World War, there was no Australian legislation that criminalised war crimes in Europe. Following the passing of the War Crimes Act, there was a 5-year period of military courts sitting in Darwin, Singapore, Hong Kong and locations in the south-west Pacific. These courts conducted 296 war crimes trials involving 924 individual Japanese defendants.Did you/uni00A0know?\n11_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   387 10/10/2017   12:41 PM",
  "Page 400": "388 UNIT 4  THE PEOPLE AND THE LAW\u2022 In a separate High Court case, Koowarta v Bjelke-Peterson (1982) 153 CLR 168, the High Court \nconsidered that the external a\ufb00airs power is not limited to implementing an international \nagreement, but that it could also be relied on to implement obligations found in other forms of international law.  \n\u2022 T he High Court in the Polyukhovich  case is an example of the Court interpreting the external \na\ufb00airs power as allowing the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws in relation to matters external to Australia. Therefore, there are other ways that the Commonwealth Parliament can use the external a\ufb00airs power to make laws, other than in relation to international treaties and declarations.\nLimitations imposed on the Commonwealth Parliament\nDespite the broad interpretation of the external a\ufb00airs power in light of international agreements, the High Court has found that it is not an unlimited power. Some of the limitations that the High \nCourt has considered are as follows. \nExtending beyond the treaty \nThe High Court has found that having become a party to an international \ntreaty, the Commonwealth Parliament is able to rely upon the external \na\ufb00airs power to give it power to enact legislation which gives e\ufb00ect \nto an international obligation. However, this is not an unlimited \nlegislative power . It does not enable the Commonwealth to \nexpand far beyond what is in the treaty. On this point, in the \nTasmanian Dam  case Justice Mason stated:\nI reject the notion that once Australia enters into a \ntreaty parliament may legislate with respect to the subject-\nmatter of the treaty as if that subject-matter were a new and independent head of Commonwealth legislative power. The \nlaw must conform to the treaty and carry its provisions into \ne\ufb00ect.\nBona \ufb01de agreement\nFurther, the High Court has held that the treaty or other international \nagreement must be bona \ufb01de ; that is, genuine (though noting that it \nwould be di\ufb03cult to argue that Australia\u2019s agreement to sign a treaty \nand give e\ufb00ect to that treaty is unlikely to be disingenuous). \nConstitutional rights \nThe Commonwealth Parliament does not have free reign to give e\ufb00ect to obligations \ncontained in international agreements. In particular, the parliament is limited by express rights  \ncontained in the Australian Constitution such as the right to freedom of religion under Section 116. \nIf legislation passed by the Commonwealth Parliament giving e\ufb00ect to a treaty obligation interferes with an express right, that legislation is likely to be invalid. \nDeclarations v treaties\nThe High Court\u2019s interpretations have to date focused on the interpretation of the external a\ufb00airs power in relation to treaties. Given the High Court\u2019s broad interpretation of \u2018external a\ufb00airs\u2019 to date, it is likely that domestic laws which give e\ufb00ect to international obligations or aspirations set out in a declaration are also likely to fall under that power, though it will depend on the case before the legislative power \nthe power to make laws, which resides with the parliament\nexpress rights rights that are stated in the Australian Constitution. Express rights are entrenched, meaning they can only be changed at a referendum\nSource 8 The High Court found that having become a party to an international treaty, the Commonwealth Parliament is able to rely on the external affairs to enact legislation which gives effect to an international obligation.\n11_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   388 10/10/2017   12:41 PM",

  "Page 406": "394 UNIT  4 THE PEOPLE AND THE LAW12.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE PARLIAMENT\nThe main role of parliament (also referred to as the legislature), is to make the law and change the law. \nParliament is the supreme law-making body, meaning it can make and change any law within its power.  \nParliament has many di\ufb00erent features, structures and processes to make sure it is an e\ufb00ective law-\nmaking body. For example, it consists of members who are elected by the people to make laws  on their \nbehalf. If these members fail to make laws that re\ufb02ect the views and values of the people, they risk not being re-elected. However, while parliament is an e\ufb00ective law-making body, it does have limitations.\nIn this chapter you will explore four factors that a\ufb00ect the ability of parliament to make/uni00A0law:\n\u2022 the roles of the houses of parliament\n\u2022 the representative nature of parliament\u2022 political pressures\u2022 restrictions on the law-making powers of parliament.\nBefore you consider these factors, you might like to review the roles of the houses of parliament \n(Victorian and Commonwealth) in law-making, examined in Chapter/uni00A010 (Topics 10.2 and/uni00A010.3).\nAustralia\u2019s parliamentary/uni00A0system\nAustralia has a federal system of government. This means the country is \ndivided into states, each of which has its own parliament that is responsible for making laws for the residents of that state. In addition, there is one central or federal parliament with power to make laws that apply to the entire country. \nThe Commonwealth and Victorian Parliaments consist of two houses. \nBecause these parliaments are made up of two houses, they are referred to as bicameral parliaments (i.e. an upper house and lower house). The Queen (or Crown) is the head of state in Australia. Her representatives are part of both the federal and state parliaments.\nThe role of/uni00A0parliament in/uni00A0law\u2013making\nAll laws made by parliaments must be passed or approved by a majority of members in both houses of parliament, and by the Crown.

It can then progress to  the \nupper house and, if passed, become law.  This allows the government to  ful\ufb01l its election promises and \nprogram of law  reform.\nIf the government has a majority in both houses, it has the power to  introduce whatever bills it likes \nand implement all of its legislative program. Only public pressure and the risk of not being re-elected \ncan prevent it from doing so.  However, having a majority in both houses can mean bills and issues are  \nnot adequately debated in the upper house. It also gives the government the ability to  reject bills without \ndebate when they have  been introduced by  a private member.  \nPrivate member\u2019s bills are  introduced by  non-government members of parliament. They  are not \na part of the government\u2019s legislative program and therefore do not generally have  the support of the \ngovernment. Most private member\u2019s bills are  introduced into the upper house, where the government \noften does not hold a majority of seats. In this way  the bill may  at least be discussed and debated by  the \nupper house before being rejected by  the lower/uni00A0house.\nWhile private member\u2019s bills often fail, introducing a bill into either house will at  least raise some \npublicity for  the cause by  gaining media attention and raising the awareness of members of parliament.\n12_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   396 10/10/2017   12:51 PM",

A/uni00A0 hung parliament is where \nneither major political party wins a majority of seats in the lower house at  an election. In situations such \nas this, the major political parties must seek the support of members of  minor political parties and \nindependents (known as the crossbench) to  enable them to  form  a minority government. \nOne main problem associated with a minority government is that it must constantly negotiate with \nminor parties and independents to  ensure its legislative program is supported and passed by  the lower \nhouse. This can result in the government being forced to  alter or \u2018water down\u2019  its original policies often to  \nthe annoyance of voters./uni00A0 \nBy contrast, however, a minority government does ensure that government bills are  thoroughly \ndiscussed and debated in the lower house.

The purpose of the bill was to  \nestablish Renew Australia (a proposed statutory authority to  oversee  the transformation of \nAustralia\u2019s electricity system).  This was  part of the Australian Greens\u2019 strategic plan to  create \na new clean economy with at least 90 per cent renewables by/uni00A02030.\nAs Mr Bandt was  not a  member \nof government of the day but \na crossbencher , the Bill was \nintroduced as a  private member\u2019s \nbill.

At the time of the introduction of the Bill on 2 May \n2016, the government\u2019s policy was  \nto encourage mining development \nincluding coal mining, so its  progress \nthrough the parliament to  become \nlaw was  not likely.

As we  have  seen, if members of the government \nvote,  as they usually do,  according to  the directives of their party (i.e. along party lines) and the government \nholds a majority of seats in both houses, government bills will inevitably be passed.\nWhile this allows the government to  introduce the law  reforms and promises it made during their \nelection campaign, it may  prevent the upper house from adequately ful\ufb01lling its role as a \u2018house of review\u2019 \nor representing the interests of the states or regions (in the Commonwealth and Victorian Parliaments \nrespectively). When the government holds a majority of seats in both houses, the upper house can become a \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 that merely con\ufb01rms the decisions made by  the government in the lower/uni00A0house. \nHostile upper/uni00A0house\nIf the government does not hold a majority of seats in the upper house, referred to  as a hostile upper \nhouse, it will face di\ufb03culties implementing its policy agenda. This is because the upper house will be able to reject the government\u2019s bills, or negotiate signi\ufb01cant amendments to/uni00A0them. \nAt the Commonwealth level, the Senate is often hostile. While this may  mean more thorough debate and  \nscrutiny of  laws,  it can also prevent or obstruct the ability of the government to  implement law  reform. In  \nApril 2016, the Senate twice failed to  pass legislation on the reintroduction of the Australian Building and  \nConstruction Commission (ABCC). This led to  Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull visiting the Governor-\nGeneral to ask him to  dissolve both houses of parliament to  force an early general federal election. The  ABCC  \nhad been abolished by  the federal Labor Government in 2012, and the government wanted to  reintroduce it as  \na way to monitor the building and construction industry and improve workplace relations.\nIn V \nictoria, the Legislative Council was  considered conservative and obstructive for  much  of its history. \nIn the past it frequently delayed or rejected legislation. \nIn 2003, however, the Legislative Council agreed to  reforms to  the Victorian state  constitution which  \nincluded giving up its power to  block supply bills (government expenditure bills) and providing a  method of  \nsolving deadlocks.Source 3 The effectiveness of the upper house can depend on whether the upper house is a rubber stamp \nor is hostile.HOSTILE \nUPPER HOUSERUBBER \nSTAMP\nrubber stamp a term used to  \ndescribe a situation in which the upper house of parliament automatically approves decisions made in the lower  house because \nthe government holds a majority of seats in both houses and votes along party lines\nhostile upper house \na situation in which the government does not hold a majority of seats in the upper house and relies on the support of the opposition or crossbench to  have \ntheir bills passed\nGovernor-General \nthe Queen\u2019s representative at the Commonwealth levelSenate \nthe upper house of the Commonwealth Parliament\nLegislative Council \nthe upper house of the Victorian Parliament\n12_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   398 10/10/2017   12:51 PM",

This will help you develop an understanding of the contemporary issues facing the parliaments, rather than discussing the issues in theory. Study/uni00A0tip\nThe balance of/uni00A0power\nAnother problem associated with having a hostile upper house is that it can allow a small group of \nindependents or members of a minor party or micro party to hold a disproportionately high level of power compared to their voter base \u2013 especially if they are placed in a position where they can vote with the opposition to block government bills. A/uni00A0situation where a small group of independents or minor \npolitical parties are able to vote with the opposition to reject a bill is referred to as the crossbench holding the balance of power. In these circumstances, the government will need to win the support of the \nminority parties and independents to have bills passed through the upper/uni00A0house.\nAnother potential problem associated \nwith minor parties and independents holding the balance of power in the upper house is that they often do not represent the views and values of the majority of the community because they often focus on a relatively narrow range of policy issues without having a detailed plan or stance on a broad range of key issues. For example, after the 2016 federal election, Senators Jacqui Lambie and Pauline Hanson attracted particular criticism from some political commentators for having a narrow policy agenda that did not address the complexities associated with major area\ns \nof law-making. This included areas such as reforming the taxation and social welfare systems and increasing economic stability and growth.Source 5 Senators Jacqui Lambie and Derryn Hinch \n(the respective leaders of the Jacqui Lambie Network and Derryn Hinch\u2019s Justice Party) were members of the Senate crossbench that held the balance of power after the 2016 federal election.\n12_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   399 10/10/2017   12:51 PM",
  "Page 412": "400 UNIT  4 THE PEOPLE AND THE  LAWA hostile  Senate  blocks  the plebiscite\nIn 2017, Senator Cory Bernardi resigned from the Liberal Party to  form his own  minor party \ncalled the Australian Conservatives. The Liberal\u2013National Coalition government faced  a \nhostile Senate and had to  rely  on the support of the crossbench to  pass bills through the \nSenate. While many bills were  still ultimately passed, the government was  forced  to make \namendments to  some of its original policies while others were outright rejected.\nFor example, in November 2016, some of the independent senators and senators from \nminor parties joined with the opposition and the Greens (who together, at the time, held 35 \nof the total  76 seats in the Senate) to  block the government\u2019s proposal to  hold a  national \nplebiscite (a  public vote) on  whether Australian law should be  changed to  allow for  marriage \nequality (namely, same-sex marriage). The government introduced the bill seeking approval to hold the plebiscite, at an estimated cost  approximately $170/uni00A0million, believing it would be \nthe quickest way to  determine support for  same-sex marriage. The opposition, however,  did \nnot support the plebiscite, claiming it was an  unnecessary waste  of public money that would \nlead to  a damaging public debate on an issue that polls clearly indicated had the support of \nthe majority of Australians. CASE\nSTUDYOn the other hand, a diverse upper house can equally be seen as an opportunity for  a more \ne\ufb00ective parliament. The  government may  be forced to  take  account of a wider range of views, and \nre\ufb02ect community interests better.  Over the last two  decades, support for  minor and micro parties and \nindependents has increased. At the 2016 federal election, minor parties and independents won  a record \nhigh 23 per cent of the vote.  While still relatively low  compared with support for  the major parties, this \nsuggests voters may  be turning away  from the major parties and are  attracted to  minor parties with a \nnarrower focus.\nThe impact minor parties, micro parties and independents can have  on the government\u2019s ability to  \npass bills through the Senate is demonstrated in the case study below.\nThe law-making process\nAt both the Commonwealth and Victorian levels, a bill must be passed by  both houses before it can \nbecome law.  All bills must progress through several  stages  in each house before they can receive royal  \nassent. These stages  include debating the bill in broad or general terms (during the second reading \ndebate) and examining it in great  depth, clause by  clause (during consideration in detail). \nThere are  both strengths and weaknesses of the roles of the houses in this process.\nStrengths\n\u2022 The requirement that a bill must be passed by  both houses gives the second house (usually the \nupper house, because in reality most bills are  introduced by  the government in the lower house) an \nopportunity to  check the bill and suggest amendments.\n\u2022 An important part of the law-making process is the debate that takes place in each of the houses. \nMembers can point out any  \ufb02aws  or any  positives of the bill. In this way  a wide range of views on the \nbill can be considered during the debates that take  place.\n\u2022 Parliament is able to  change the law  quickly if necessary, particularly if the government has a majority \nin both houses of parliament, even  though the legislative process is generally slow (see below). For  \nexample, in 2017 the Bail Amendment (Stage  One) Bill 2017 (Vic), introduced in the Legislative \nAssembly on 24 May  2017, was  passed by  both houses and granted royal  assent  by 27 June 2017.

This can slow the legislative process. For example, in 2016, the Senate and the House of Representatives only sat for 42 and 51 days respectively, compared with 60 and 75 days in 2015. The government can, however, extend the sitting period or even recall parliament for a special session. \n\u2022 T he parliament as a whole is restricted in its law-making ability by the fact that it can only pass the \nlaws that are presented to it, usually by the government of the day. The government therefore has a responsibility to ensure that the laws presented to parliament, as far as possible, respond to the needs of the people.\nThe committee/uni00A0system\nAnother strength of the houses of parliament in the law-making process is that both the lower and upper house (at Commonwealth and Victorian level) have an extensive committee system. This allows members of the houses to examine and evaluate the need for law reform, and provides a way for members of the community to have input on the issues being investigated. Their views will then be considered in the parliamentary decision-making process. For example, in addition to a range of other committees, the Victorian Legislative Council has three ongoing or permanent committees (called standing committees) that examine the need for law reform and propose legislative reform in the areas of economy and infrastructure, environment and planning, and legal and social issues. The committee system is examined later in this chapter and discussed in greater detail in Chapter/uni00A014.\nSource 6 The Bail Amendment (Stage One) Bill 2017 (Vic) sought to strengthen bail laws for certain \naccused personsbail the release of an accused person from custody on condition that they will attend a court hearing to answer the charges \naccused \na person charged with a criminal offence\n12_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   401 10/10/2017   12:51 PM",

  "Page 416": "404 UNIT  4 THE PEOPLE AND THE LAWTHE REPRESENTATIVE NATURE OF \nPARLIAMENT12.3 \nIn addition to the roles of the houses of parliament, political pressures, and restrictions on the law-\nmaking powers of parliament, the representative nature of parliament is another factor that can a\ufb00ect parliament\u2019s e\ufb00ectiveness as a law-making/uni00A0body.\nIn this topic you will explore the following in relation to this factor:\n\u2022 the meaning of representative government\n\u2022 the views of the majority\u2022 regular elections.\nThe meaning of/uni00A0representative government\nAustralia\u2019s parliamentary system is based on the principle of representative government. This means \nthat at both Commonwealth and state levels, parliament and government consists of members who are elected by the people to make laws on their behalf. If these members fail to make laws that re\ufb02ect the views and values of the people, or fail to address the needs of the community, they will jeopardise their chance of being re-elected. \nThis essential parliamentary principle is the basis of our democratic system. It helps to ensure that \nmembers of parliament engage with and listen to the views and concerns of the electorate. It also ensures that the government, and the opposition, remain accountable and answerable to the people, and explain their legislative programs during their term in o\ufb03ce and election campaigns so the public make an informed decision about which party or members they support.\nThe views of/uni00A0the majority\nThe representative nature of parliament encourages members of parliament to listen to the views of the community and make laws in accordance with these views. When people see the need for a change in the law, they may undertake a range of activities, such as forming a petition, organising a demonstration, \nusing social media or contacting their local member of parliament, to express their view and indicate \nto government that there is a need for law reform. The fact that our parliament and government is representative of the people means that these activities can often be in\ufb02uential in promoting law reform.\nWhile the representative nature of the parliament helps ensure elected members make laws that re\ufb02ect \nthe views and values of the majority of society, it does have limitations. In an attempt to be re-elected, members of parliament may introduce and support laws that are popular with voters rather than passing more controversial laws that may be necessary, but are unpopular with voters.\nFor example, as part of the 2013 election, the Liberal\u2013National Coalition campaigned on a policy that \nthey would abolish the existing carbon tax and introduce strict border security laws where boats carrying asylum seekers would be sent back to their place of origin, in an attempt to \u2018stop the boats\u2019 . While the policies initially attracted the support of a large number of voters, the policies were divisive. For example, many people believed the \u2018stop the boats\u2019 policy was inhumane and created an environment of fear to attract voters. Likewise, some people believed the carbon tax should not have been abolished because it bene\ufb01ted the environment by encouraging a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\nOther instances where governments have introduced popular laws to win votes rather than introducing \nmore necessary or practical laws have occurred in the area of taxation and law and order measures. For example, they may legislate tax cuts at a time when they are short of funds and it might be wiser to pay o\ufb00 debt. Similarly, governments can introduce harsher penalties for crimes  because it appears popular representative \ngovernment a political system in which the people elect members of parliament to represent them in government\npetition \na formal, written request to the government to take some action or implement law reform\ndemonstration \na group of people who gather to protest (i.e. express their common concern or dissatisfaction with) an existing law as a means of influencing law reform\nsocial media \na range of digital tools, applications and websites used to share information in real time between large groups of people (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat)\n12_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   404 10/10/2017   12:51 PM",

While victims are  \nimportant, they are  not the only consideration in well-balanced criminal laws.  For example, academic \nstudies show that harsher sentences generally do little to  reduce crime and do not address the underlying \nreasons for  crime. Taking a longer term  view, some of the money spent on keeping more people in prison \nmight be better spent on education.\nThe case study below explores whether introducing penalties that the majority of society supports \nactually reduces crime rates.\nIncreased  penalties  for street  violence\nIn March  2017,  following an  increase  in street  violence  at public  events  such  as Moomba,  \nthe Victorian Government announced  it would  implement harsher penalties  for members  \nof gangs and individuals  who  participated  in street  violence.  The  government announced  \nit would  create  the new  crime of  violent  disorder  for those  people  who  participated  in \nviolent  street  riots, which  would  carry  a \nmaximum penalty  of 10/uni00A0years imprisonment,  \nor 15/uni00A0years imprisonment if the  offender  was  \nwearing a mask or face covering.\nThe introduction  of more  severe penalties  \nfor specific  crimes has  been  popular  with  \nvoters  (e.g.   Victorian  mandatory  sentencing  \nlaws  that impose a  minimum ten-year  term of  \nimprisonment  on those  found guilty  of a fatal  \none-punch  attack).  However  some  critics  \nargue  that  these penalties  do little  to reduce  \ncrime rates  and do not  address  its underlying  \ncauses.CASE\nSTUDY\nVictorian Law  Reform \nCommission (VLRC) \nVictoria\u2019s leading independent law reform organisation.

For example, while opinion polls suggest that \nthe majority of Australian voters support changing the law  to allow voluntary euthanasia, some vocal and \noutspoken minority groups do not support law  reform in this area. Parliaments have  been reluctant to  \nchange the law  without a clear majority/uni00A0view.\nIt can also be di\ufb03cult for  members of parliament and governments to  assess the view of the majority \nof people in areas where there are  con\ufb02icting societal views on controversial issues. For  example, \ncommunity opinion appears divided in many areas of  law reform. These include decriminalising drug use \nand allowing the opening of  safe  drug injecting rooms, allowing the mining and export of uranium, and \nintroducing lock-out laws  that ban people from entering pubs and clubs after a certain hour (e.g. 2:00 am) \nin an attempt to  reduce alcohol-fuelled violence.\nReform is also expensive, and governments may  avoid it for  that reason. Even though parliament can \ninvestigate areas of proposed laws  change using parliamentary committees and inquiries or referring \nmatters of  law reform to  bodies such as the Victorian Law  Reform Commission (VLRC), these \ninvestigations and consultations can be time-consuming and expensive to  set up,  which may  delay reform. \nEven if changes are  recommended, they are  not necessarily adopted by  the parliament, and that wastes \nthe time and money spent on/uni00A0them.\n12_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   405 10/10/2017   12:51 PM",
  "Page 418": "406 UNIT  4 THE PEOPLE AND THE LAWSimilarly, while parliament also has the power to make laws to cover future circumstances, it can be \ndi\ufb03cult for governments to accurately predict the future views and needs of the community and make laws \nto provide for them. For example, successive Australian Governments have found it di\ufb03cult to anticipate the e\ufb00ects of medical advancements in areas such as assisted reproductive treatment and genome testing (to identify genetic disorders). This means the law in these areas can lag behind technological advancements. \nWhere predictions seem to be easier to make, an e\ufb00ective government will be proactive, rather than \nresponding only after problems arise. For example, it can be expected that more individuals will undertake genome testing in the coming years. Our governments should therefore consider laws such as ways to protect people from being discriminated against by potential employers.\nRegular elections\nTo achieve representative government, regular elections must be held so the people can vote for politicians to represent them in parliament. If the government does not represent the needs of the majority of the people during its term in o\ufb03ce, it is likely to be voted out of o\ufb03ce at the forthcoming election.\nIt is compulsory to vote. Some critics claim compulsory voting undermines the principle of \nrepresentative government because it forces those who are not interested to cast an ill-informed vote. Other members of the community consider compulsory voting to be a breach of individual rights.\nBy contrast, those who support compulsory voting suggest that it helps ensure our parliaments and \ngovernments have the support of the majority of people and not just those who bother to vote. It also forces candidates and political parties to consider the needs of the entire society when formulating their policies.\nIn Australia, elections for the Commonwealth Parliament are held every three years, while the Victorian \nParliament is elected every four years, on the last Saturday in November. \nA criticism of the federal electoral system made by some political analysts and members of the \ncommunity is that federal elections are not held on a \ufb01xed date. The government can call an early election when the political climate might best suit them. For example, a government might call an early election if they fear an imminent or looming slow-down in the economy, which may cause them to lose popularity. Likewise, governments may introduce a \u2018soft budget\u2019 that has very few unpopular tax increases and spending cuts prior to an election to help win the support of voters. \nOn the other hand, there may be good reasons why the government, the opposition parties or the people \nmight want an election earlier than planned. For example, in the United Kingdom, the seriousness of Brexit (Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union) led the prime minister to call an early election so preparations would not be interrupted half-way through by an election and a possible change of government./uni00A0 \nAt the federal level, a change of election timing to extend the election term would require a referendum, \nsince Section 28 of the Constitution provides that a term must last no longer than three years (but can be \nshortened). At the state level it requires only an ordinary Act to be passed. \nHowever, four-year terms might encourage governments to be \nmore willing to introduce law reforms that have a longer term bene\ufb01t because they will be less concerned about any short-term negative impacts associated with the reform. Increasing the term of government would also give voters more certainty and allow businesses to be more con\ufb01dent about investment. Businesses often delay making important decisions prior to an election in anticipation that the government might change. Having elections every four years is also consistent with many other nations that have federal elections every four years on \ufb01xed dates, including the United States of America. Interestingly, in 2017 Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten indicated that they both agree that the federal elections should be every four years.referendum \nthe method used for changing the wording of the Australian Constitution.

  "Page 420": "408 UNIT  4 THE PEOPLE AND THE LAWPOLITICAL PRESSURES 12.4 \nOne of the strengths of our parliamentary system is that it is representative of the people. Parliament \nconsists of members elected by the people to make laws on their behalf. If they fail to do so, they may jeopardise their re-election. This helps ensure that members of parliament and governments listen to the views of the community and make laws in accordance with these/uni00A0views.\nIt also means, however, that individual members of parliament, governments and political parties \nfeel that they need to remain popular with voters. This can cause them to make decisions and support law reform based on whether or not it will increase their popularity and public approval rating rather than the merits of the law reform. Similarly, it can allow in\ufb02uential individuals, organisations, businesses and pressure groups, particularly those which have signi\ufb01cant \ufb01nancial power or the ability to in\ufb02uence community perceptions, to place pressure on politicians and political parties to implement policies and support law reform that is in their best interest rather than the nation\u2019s.\nIndividual members of parliament may also feel pressure from within their own political party to vote \nin accordance with party policy even when they do not support their party\u2019s stance on a particular issue or law reform. Politicians and governments can also be subject to political pressure from other countries, international organisations (like the United Nations and Amnesty International) and multinational corporations.\nIn this topic you will explore the following types of political pressures facing parliament:/uni00A0\n\u2022 domestic political pressures\n\u2022 internal political pressures\u2022 international political pressures.\nDOMESTIC POLITICAL\nPRESSURESINTERNAL POLITICAL\nPRESSURESINTERNATIONAL POLITICAL\nPRESSURES\nSource 1 Parliament is subject to domestic, internal and international political pressures\nDomestic political pressures\nOne strength of having a parliamentary system based on the principle of representative government, \nwhere members of parliament are elected by the people to make laws on their behalf, is that there is a link between the people, the parliament and the government. Members of parliament and the government must be responsive to the needs of the people and make laws that re\ufb02ect the views and values of the community.\nThis is important because it enables individual members of the community, business groups, \norganisations and pressure groups, particularly those that might represent a minority group that feels ignored, to have a sense that they can in\ufb02uence individual members of parliament and the government. For example, individuals and pressure groups can organise petitions and demonstrations in an attempt to pressure members of parliament and governments to introduce law reform that support their cause. \n12_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   408 10/10/2017   12:51 PM",
  "Page 421": "409  CHAPTER  12 THE PARLIAMENT  If these methods gain strong community support and media attention (which can generate further public \nsupport), members of parliament and governments will be more likely to  respond through fear of losing \npopularity with voters.\nHowever, sometimes small but vocal minority pressure groups and powerful businesses and \norganisations may  place excessive pressure on politicians and impede important law  reform. For  example, \nstate  governments have  generally been slow to  introduce law  reform in areas like the decriminalisation of  \nabortion and the right of individuals to  make end-of-life choices (euthanasia) in part through fear of losing \nthe support of vocal pressure groups and organisations that oppose such change (such as the Australian \nChristian Lobby, Right to  Life Australia and the Australian Family Association). Methods used by  individuals \nand pressure groups to  in\ufb02uence a change in the law  are examined in more detail in Chapter/uni00A014.\nThe case study below is an example of the Victorian Government passing a law  that has been impeded \nfor many years by  pro-life pressure groups.\nAnti-abortion  protesters  moved/uni00A0on\nIn 2016, a  law came into effect in Victoria that prevented members of anti-abortion pressure \ngroups from being within a  150-metre boundary of an East Melbourne Fertility Clinic that \nprovides lawful terminations of pregnancy. The law was  passed by the Victorian Parliament \nafter the clinic had expressed concerns for  decades that many of its  clients were  being \napproached, and sometimes felt intimidated and harassed, by anti-abortion protesters who regularly waited outside the clinic to  urge women not to  proceed with their termination.\nOver the years, anti-abortion pressure groups such as Right to  Life Australia have been \nvocal in their support for  laws that control and prohibit abortion and end-of-life choices. After \nthe Victorian Parliament passed the exclusion (or \u2018buffer zone\u2019) law, the president of Right to  \nLife Australia, Margaret Tighe, released a  statement expressing her dissatisfaction with the \nlaw, claiming it was  a denial of freedom of speech and would not deter the group from their \ncause. She stated, \u2018People will not remain silent in the face  of so much killing of human/uni00A0life.\u2019CASE\nSTUDY\nBusiness groups and organisations\nIn\ufb02uential business groups and organisations can also place signi\ufb01cant political pressure on members of parliament and governments to  make laws  in their best interests. For  example, trade unions (like \nthe Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Victorian Trade Hall Council and the Australian Nurses Federation) often lobby the government and support political parties that promise to  provide better wages  \nand conditions for  workers, while business organisations (e.g. the Business Council of Australia and the \nVictorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry) lobby and support political parties that will best represent employer groups and the business sector.\nSimilarly, large environmental groups (like Wilderness Society (Australia) and the Australian Conservation  \nFoundation) have  been able to  place political pressure on governments to  consider the way  their policies  \nand decisions will impact upon the environment. Such groups have  sought to  in\ufb02uence legislation relating  \nto areas such as land care  and clearing, nuclear power, renewable energy, forest logging and the timber  \nindustry, the mining industry, conservation of Australia\u2019s nature and wilderness and climate change.\nFinancial donations\nIn\ufb02uential individuals, business groups and organisations may  also seek to  place indirect pressure on \npolitical parties, including the governing party, to  make policies and support law  reform and initiatives that \nare in their interests by  contributing \ufb01nancial donations. While donations may  not necessarily in\ufb02uence The Australian Labor \nParty (ALP) was created in the 1890s by trade unions to  represent the \nviews of the workers and give them a voice in parliament. Even today some trade unions still have an important influence at state  and \nfederal Labor Party conferences, where policy is determined.

Financial donations may be used by political parties \nin a variety of ways, including on promotions and marketing during election \ncampaigns.\nIn the \ufb01nancial year 2015\u201316, just before the July 2016 federal election, \nthe Liberal Party received approximately $15/uni00A0million in donations including \na $1.3/uni00A0million donation from Paul Marks, the executive chairman of mining \ncompany Nimrod Resources. The Liberal Party also received a $1.75/uni00A0million donation from its own party leader, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, and \n$500 000 from Chinese property investment company Hong Kong Kingson \nInvestment Co./uni00A0Ltd.\nBy contrast, the ALP received its largest donation of $657 395 from the \nShop, Distributive & Allied Employees\u2019 Association, a union for those who work \nin the retail, fast food, warehouse, hair and beauty and modelling industries. The \nALP also received $520 000 from United Voice, one of Australia\u2019s largest, and oldest, \ntrade unions.\nIndependents\nIn\ufb02uential individuals, prominent business people and members of community groups and organisations sometimes run as independent candidates, or form their own political parties, in an attempt to win a seat in parliament so they may directly in\ufb02uence law reform.\nFor example, a well-known media personality, Derryn Hinch, formed his own political party, Derryn \nHinch\u2019s Justice Party, in 2015. Mr Hinch was keen to in\ufb02uence law reform within the criminal justice system to ensure that violent o\ufb00enders received harsher sentences and the rights of victims of crime were upheld. Mr Hinch, who was elected to the Senate in 2016, also supports the controversial proposal \nto introduce a national public register for sex o\ufb00enders, by way of a website and online application which shows the o\ufb00ender\u2019s name, aliases, crime he or she has committed and address.\nInternal political pressures from/uni00A0within a political/uni00A0party\nAs explored in Topic 12.2, members of parliament who belong to a political party are generally expected to vote as one bloc and support the views of their party. This is referred to as voting on party lines, because the members of parliament vote according to the wishes of their party. For example, members of parliament who belong to the governing party are expected to support all government bills. This means these bills will pass through the lower house because the government has the majority in the lower house (or in the case of a hung parliament can usually gain su\ufb03cient support from independent members of the parliament).\n \nHowever, individual members of parliament sometimes disagree with their party\u2019s view or policy \nstance on a particular issue or law reform, yet still feel compelled to vote in accordance with their party. The political pressure to vote along party lines can lead to individual members of parliament not voting in accordance with their own moral conscience or in accordance with their speci\ufb01c electorate or local community. Alternatively, if an individual member strongly disagrees with their party\u2019s policy, and the party does not allow its members a rare conscience vote, the member may \u2018cross the \ufb02oor\u2019 to temporarily support the opposing party\u2019s view, and vote against their own/uni00A0party.voting on party lines \nwhen members of parliament vote in accordance with their party\u2019s policy or agenda\nconscience vote \na vote in parliament by its members in accordance with their moral views and values (or those held by the majority of their electorate) rather than in accordance with party policy\nSource 2 Before the July 2016 federal election, the Liberal Party received a $1.3 million donation from Paul Marks, the executive chairman of mining company Nimrod Resources.\ncriminal justice system a set of processes and institutions used to investigate and determine criminal cases\n12_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   410 10/10/2017   12:51 PM",

The three senators (who were  part  \nof the Coalition in government) voted against the government\u2019s policy by supporting a  motion  \nintroduced by  the Australian Greens. The motion was to  change laws on  competition regulation  \nas a way to reduce the power of  large businesses to  act in  ways  that disadvantaged farmers and  \nsmall businesses. Two  other government senior ministers also abstained from voting.\nSimilarly, in 2017 another government member, George Christensen, crossed the floor to  \nvote with the opposition in an attempt to  prevent cuts to  weekend penalty rates (increased \nwages for certain employees who work on weekends).CASE \nSTUDY\nWhere a minority government does not hold an absolute majority in the lower house, the government \nwill be subject to  even  more political pressure. This is because they will need to  negotiate with the minor \nparties and independent members of parliament and at  times may have  to compromise their policies to  \nensure their bills pass the lower house. This ensures the actions of the government are  carefully scrutinised. \nSimilarly, if the government faces a hostile upper house, it will face political pressure from the opposition \nand crossbench members, and may  be required to  make further compromises.\nEven if the government has a majority in both houses, the parliament plays an active role in ensuring, \nas much  as possible, that the proposed laws  are discussed fully and amended to  suit the needs of most \npeople.

She claimed that the proposal would not have passed the lower  \nhouse. \nCritics of the prime minister claimed she never  intended to  \nintroduce the controversial anti-gambling reforms but rather told  \nMr Wilkie that she would to  secure his support.\nIn July 2016, in the new  parliament formed after a  double  \ndissolution (which returned even  more senators from alternative  \nparties), Andrew Wilkie MP and Senator Nick Xenophon joined  \nwith other backbenchers to  return to  this issue, pressuring the  \ngovernment to  tackle problem gambling.

It was the \nhighest  annual  number  ever recorded  by the United \nNations.International political pressures\nPoliticians and governments can be in\ufb02uenced by  political pressure from international forces including \nother countries, international organisations (such as the United Nations, Human Rights Watch,  Amnesty \nInternational and Greenpeace International) and multinational corporations.\nAustralia is part of a global community. It is not only a signatory to  a range of  international treaties \nbut has also passed legislation to  formally recognise its commitments under those treaties. For  example, \nAustralia has formally agreed to  adopt the principles set out in international treaties including the \nConvention on the Rights of the Child (1989) and the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and \nDegrading Treatment or Punishment/uni00A0(1984).\nBeing a signatory to,  or having rati\ufb01ed, international treaties can subject the Australian Government \nto international political pressure if it fails to  uphold the basic principles they contain. For  example, in 2015 \nthe Federal Government received domestic and international pressure from bodies including the United \nNations, the Australian Human Rights Commission and the National Inquiry into Children in Immigration Detention over  its policies relating to  the treatment of children of asylum seekers held in detention, which \nmany claimed breached the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In particular, the National Inquiry found \nthat 34 per cent of children detained in Australia and on Christmas Island had a mental health disorder of such severity that they required psychiatric support. This compared with fewer than 2 per/uni00A0 cent of  \nchildren in the general community with mental health disorders of this severity.

Many citizens and \norganisations, including Amnesty International and the United Nations, have been critical of Australia\u2019s response.

The Commonwealth Parliament has no right to make laws in areas of residual power unless they are given the power to do so through:\n\u2022 a High Court interpretation of the Constitution\u2022 the states handing over or referring their powers to the Commonwealth,/uni00A0or\u2022 through an actual change to the Constitution by way of a referendum.\nThe Commonwealth does, however, have the power to make a tied grant to the states, and that \ncan indirectly allow them to in\ufb02uence law \u2013 making in the states\u2019 residual areas of power. It may also \nmake laws in areas of residual power if it is making laws with respect to its international obligations (as \ndiscussed in Chapter 11).\nA tied grant is funding given by the Commonwealth to the states \u2018with strings attached\u2019 . The \nCommonwealth speci\ufb01es what the states must do with the money \u2013 for example, it might specify that the funds be spent on new roads or a hospital.\nSimilarly, the state parliaments are not able to make laws in areas of exclusive powers, as they are \npowers held solely by the Commonwealth Parliament. This acts as a restriction on the state parliaments as they cannot pass laws in areas such as defence and border patrol.\nChallenging the/uni00A0validity/uni00A0of/uni00A0law\nIf an individual, group, organisation or government believes the Victorian or Commonwealth Parliament has made a law outside of or beyond its law-making powers they are able to challenge the validity of the law in the courts.\nOne advantage of challenging a law through the court is that it can clarify the extent of the law-making \npowers of parliament and whether a law is valid. This can clarify an unclear area that may apply to many people, or challenge a politically controversial government policy (e.g. o\ufb00shore detention centres such as Manus Island). Test cases are often run with the assistance of not-for-pro\ufb01t bodies such as community subordinate bodies \ndelegated bodies or secondary authorities (e.g. local councils, government departments and statutory authorities such as Australia Post and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Board) which are given power by parliament to make rules and regulations on its behalf\nspeci\ufb01c prohibitions \nareas in which the state and Commonwealth parliaments are constitutionally banned from making law\nresidual powers \npowers that were not given to the Commonwealth Parliament under the Australian Constitution and which therefore remain with the states (as opposed to concurrent powers and exclusive powers)\ntied grant \nfunding (i.e. money) given to a state government by the Commonwealth on the condition that it spends the money in the manner specified by the Commonwealth\nexclusive powers \npowers in the Australian Constitution that only the Commonwealth Parliament can exercise (as opposed to residual powers and concurrent powers)\n12_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   415 10/10/2017   12:51 PM",

A/uni00A0weakness is that running a court case is \nexpensive and time-consuming even if the lawyers are not/uni00A0paid. \nOne of the main roles of the High Court of \nAustralia is to resolve constitutional disputes. \nIf the High Court rules that the Commonwealth parliament has passed legislation beyond its law-making powers (that is, ultra vires), it has the \npower to declare the legislation invalid and this decision cannot be overridden by the parliament. This is one way in which the High Court defends the rule of law and protects the Constitution; by \npreventing legislation made beyond power from taking e\ufb00ect. \nWhile parliament is the supreme law-making \nbody and has the ability to override common law, or abrogate  common law, it cannot override \na decision of the High Court when the Court declares that legislation has been made ultra vires. \nSpecific prohibitions\nThe Australian Constitution also restricts the law-making powers of the state and Commonwealth Parliaments by expressly banning or prohibiting parliaments from making laws in particular areas. For example, the Australian Constitution restricts the states\u2019 law-making powers by, among other things, banning them from forming their own military or naval forces (Section 114)/uni00A0 and creating their own currency (Section 115). The Constitution also restricts the law-making powers of the Commonwealth Parliament by banning the Commonwealth Parliament, among other things, from establishing a religion or imposing any religious service (Section 116)/uni00A0and making laws that discriminate against the residents of a state (Section/uni00A0117).\nThe Constitution also prohibits the Commonwealth Parliament from making laws in residual areas \nof power \u2013 that is, areas of power that solely belong to the states. The Constitution also prevents the state and Commonwealth Parliaments from changing its wording by providing, through Section 128, that it can only be changed by way of a referendum.\nSection 109 of the Commonwealth Constitution states that to the extent of any inconsistency \nCommonwealth law overrules state law. Not only does this limit the states\u2019 law-making power if they pass legislation that is inconsistent with the Commonwealth in a concurrent area of power, but it also might \ndiscourage the states from making a law in a concurrent area of/uni00A0power.ultra vires \na Latin term meaning \u2018beyond the powers\u2019; a law made beyond (i.e. outside) the powers of the parliament\nrule of law \nthe principle that everyone in society is bound by law and must obey the law.

  "Page 431": "419  CHAPTER  12 THE PARLIAMENT  The turbulent nature of the Federal Government\nAfter the July 2016 election, Prime Minister Malcolm \nTurnbull found himself under growing political pressure from an electorate that was  becoming increasingly \ndissatis\ufb01ed with the conservative right within the Liberal Party. After Donald Trump won  the US \nPresidency in November 2016, former Liberal prime minister Tony  Abbott claimed the Liberal Party\u2019s best \nchance of success was  to follow a conservative political \napproach.\nThe Liberal \u2013National Coalition faced a hostile upper \nhouse and a crossbench with some new players, including three senators from Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation party, Jacqui Lambie and Derryn Hinch. The defection of Cory Bernardi from the Liberal Party in February 2017 made it harder for  \nthe Federal Government to  have  their bills passed. \nThe government was  required to  win the support of at least 10 of the 12-member crossbench if the opposition (the Labor Party) and the Greens voted against their policies.\nWinning the support of the minor parties and the \nindependents could prove  challenging given some of \ntheir policies. An example is Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation Party which supports a range  of controversial \npolicies. Many of these relate to  the rights of Muslims \nin Australia, such as banning Muslim immigration until the safety of Australians can be assured, banning the wearing of the burqa and niquab in public places and banning halal certi\ufb01cation. \nOn top  of this, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull may  \nalso face pressure from members of his own  party.

  "Page 434": "UNIT  4 THE PEOPLE AND THE  LAW 422INTRODUCTION  TO THE COURTS 13.1 \nThe Australian legal system consists of a whole body of  law that regulates society. This body of  law \nincludes laws  made by  the parliaments, called statute law , and laws  made by  judges or the courts, called \ncommon law  (or case/uni00A0law).\nThe main role of an elected parliament (also referred to  as the legislature), is to  make law  and change \nthe law  on behalf of the people. This is why  parliament is referred to  as the supreme law-making body. It \ncan make and change any  law within its constitutional/uni00A0power.\nThe main role of the courts, (also referred to  as the judiciary), is to  apply existing laws  made by  \nparliament to  resolve disputes. The  courts are  also able to  make law  when necessary, and are  vital in the \nprocess of law-making. However, as we  will see throughout this chapter, like parliament, their ability to  \nmake law  is limited. \nThe Australian/uni00A0courts\nThe Australian legal system includes a range of di\ufb00erent courts; some are  federal courts and some are  \nstate  courts. Generally, the state  courts deal with issues that arise under state law,  and the federal courts \ndeal with disputes that relate to  federal (or Commonwealth)/uni00A0law.\nThe federal courts are: \n\u2022 the High Court of Australia\n\u2022 the Federal Court\u2022 the Federal Circuit Court\u2022 the Family Court.The Victorian courts are:\n\u2022 the Supreme Court (separated into the Trial \nDivision and the Court of Appeal)\n\u2022 the County Court\u2022 the Magistrates\u2019 Court\u2022 the Children\u2019s Court\u2022 the Coroners Court.\nThe courts in the Australian court system are  ranked in a hierarchy from lowest to  highest, with the \nhigher courts hearing more serious and complicated cases, and the lower courts dealing with more minor \nissues.\nWhile the High Court is a federal court, matters from each of the state  Courts of Appeal can be heard \nby the High Court on appeal where leave (permission) has been granted. The  High Court is the highest \njudicial law-making authority in Australia.

If the High Court declares the Commonwealth has made a law ultra vires (or beyond its \nconstitutional power) it can declare the law invalid or/uni00A0void.\nIn accordance with the principles of the separation of powers and the rule of law, all courts \nthroughout Australia are independent from the parliament and the government. This means judges can determine cases and establish legal principles without pressure or in\ufb02uence from the parliament or government of the day. Because they are appointed by government and not elected by the people, they are also able to make independent and impartial decisions without being subject to political pressure from voters, pressure groups, in\ufb02uential individuals and organisations, and the/uni00A0media.\nThroughout this chapter, you will learn how courts can make laws by establishing legal \nprinciples and interpreting statutes when resolving disputes.

For example, a judge might be required to make a decision on a totally new issue that has not previously been brought before the court, or be required to expand an existing principle of law so it can be applied to a new situation.\n\u2022 W hen the court resolves a dispute in which there is an existing statute but the statute requires \ninterpretation so it can be applied to the case before the court. By interpreting the meaning of the words and phrases in an existing Act of Parliament, judges can broaden or narrow its meaning. In doing so, judges make law by establishing a new principle of law to be followed in future similar cases. This process, where courts are required to interpret the meaning of an Act of Parliament, is referred to as statutory interpretation and is examined in more detail later in this chapter.\nWhen judges in superior courts make a decision in one of these circumstances, the reason for the \ndecision (referred to as the ratio decidendi) establishes a new legal principle to be followed (referred to \nas a precedent). \nThe doctrine of/uni00A0precedent\nAs in other courts throughout Australia, judges within the Victorian court hierarchy rely on previous court \ndecisions to guide them. In other words, they look at the reasoning behind the decisions in past cases for guidance when deciding new cases. When a new situation arises, and is decided on, a precedent is created.\nA precedent is the reasoning behind a court\u2019s decision. It establishes a legal principle or legal rule that \nmust be followed by other courts ranked lower in the same court hierarchy when they are deciding future cases that are similar. This process of judges following the legal reasoning behind the decisions of higher courts is referred to as the doctrine of precedent. The doctrine of precedent creates consistency and \npredictability. By looking at past cases, a party that takes a case to court can anticipate how the law may apply to their situation and have some idea of the outcome because similar cases are decided in a similar manner.\nLaw-making through the courts generally occurs when a court is hearing an appeal (so there is no \njury) or a case where there is no a jury. A verdict given by a jury cannot create a precedent because juries determine only the facts of the case. They do not decide on points of law \u2013 that is left to judges. Juries also do not give reasons for their decisions. The judges make their decision and state the legal reasoning behind their decision. It is this legal reasoning behind the decision that forms the precedent and becomes binding on lower courts in the same hierarchy when they are deciding future cases with similar material/uni00A0facts.statutory \ninterpretation the process by which judges give meaning to the words or phrases in an Act of Parliament (i.e. statute) so it can be applied to resolve the case before them\nratio decidendi  \na Latin term meaning \u2018the reason\u2019; the legal reasoning behind a judge\u2019s decision.

  "Page 437": "425  CHAPTER  13 THE COURTS  The Victorian court hierarchy and the/uni00A0doctrine \nof/uni00A0precedent\nThe doctrine of precedent requires lower courts to  follow precedents set in superior courts. Precedent, \ntherefore, depends on the courts being organised in a hierarchy based on the seriousness and complexity \nof the cases they have  authority to  resolve. Only superior courts, usually those that have  the power to  \ndecide cases on appeal, are  able to  set precedents and make law.  In the Victorian court hierarchy (from \nlowest to  highest) these are  the High Court, the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court and the Trial \nDivision of the Supreme/uni00A0Court.\nA decision made by  the High Court on appeal from a state  or territory court is binding on courts in all \nstates and territories. \nKey features of/uni00A0the doctrine of/uni00A0precedent\nThere are  a number of  key features of the doctrine of precedent:\n\u2022 the principle of stare decisis\n\u2022 ratio decidendi\n\u2022 binding precedents\u2022 persuasive precedents\n\u2022 obiter dicta. \nThe principle of/uni00A0stare decisis\nThe principle of  stare decisis is another way  of describing the process of lower courts following the reasons \nfor the decisions of higher courts. Stare decisis is a Latin phrase meaning \u2018to  stand by  what has been \ndecided\u2019 . Where appropriate and required, judges should stand by  previous decisions to  ensure common \nlaw is consistent and predictable.\nRatio  decidendi\nRatio  decidendi is a Latin phrase meaning \u2018the reason for  the decision\u2019 . It is the binding part of a judgment. \nA/uni00A0judgment is a statement by  the judge at  the end of a case that outlines the decision and the legal \nreasoning behind the decision. The  ratio  decidendi is not the decision itself, or the sanction or remedy \ngiven. It is regarded as a statement of  law to be followed in the future.\nAn example of a court\u2019s reason for  its decision is provided in the legal case below.stare decisis  \na Latin term meaning \u2018let the decision stand\u2019; the basic principle underlying the doctrine of precedent\npersuasive precedent \nthe legal reasoning behind a decision of a lower  (or equal) \ncourt within the same jurisdiction, or a court in a different jurisdiction, that may \nbe c\nonsidered relevant \n(and therefore used as a source of influence) even  though it is not \nbinding (see binding precedent) \nobiter dictum  \na Latin term meaning \u2018by the way\u2019; comments made by the judge in a particular case that may be persuasive \nin future cases (even though they do not form a part of the reason for the decision and are not binding)\njudgment \na statement by the judge at the end of case that outlines the decision and the legal reasoning behind the decision\nNegligent advice about/uni00A0land\nL Shaddock & Associates Pty Ltd v Parramatta City Council (No 1) (1981) \n150 CLR/uni00A0225\nIn this case, Shaddock was  given incorrect advice by Parramatta City Council about a  piece \nof land he wished to  purchase for  redevelopment. It is usual practice for  a purchaser to  ask \nthe local council for  information about any orders that may  affect a  piece of land. The Council \ncompleted the usual form that gives information to  the purchaser, and left the section relating \nto road-widening blank. It was  therefore quite reasonably assumed that there was  no road-\nwidening order affecting the piece of/uni00A0land.\nShaddock purchased the land relying on this advice. He later found that this advice was  \nincorrect. There was a  proposal for  road-widening, which made the land useless for  the purpose \nfor which it was purchased.LEGAL  \nCASE\n13_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   425 10/10/2017   1:10 PM",
  "Page 438": "426 UNIT 4  THE PEOPLE AND THE LAWThe task of determining the ratio decidendi of a case can be complex. It could be found in various parts \nof the judgment, and may not appear conveniently in a single, succinct expression of the/uni00A0law.\nIn many cases heard on appeal, or in constitutional matters heard in the High Court, several judges \nare involved in reaching a decision. If they cannot reach a unanimous decision, the precedent created is \nthat of the majority. In such cases the ratio decidendi has to be found by looking at the judgments of those judges who form the majority.\nWhen extracting the ratio decidendi from the judgment as a whole or the individual judgments, only the \nmaterial facts are relevant and are to be followed in future cases. The material facts are important facts that could a\ufb00ect the outcome of the case and are vital to the reason for the decision. For example, in the Shaddock case it is not vital to the decision to know that the item in question was a piece of land, that the advice-giver was a city council or that the information concerned road-widening.\n It is the ratio decidendi and these material facts that are considered when deciding cases in the future. \nThe ratio decidendi of a case may be more clearly stated in a later judgment written by a court that has \nhad to consider whether the previous case provides a binding precedent.\nBinding precedents\nBinding precedents are precedents that have been established by superior courts and must be followed by lower courts in the same hierarchy when resolving disputes with similar material facts. If a judge is bound by an existing precedent, they are obliged to follow it, regardless of whether they agree with the legal reasoning behind the decision of the superior/uni00A0court.\nFor a precedent to be binding on a particular case, it must be set by a superior court from within the \nsame court hierarchy. For example:\n\u2022 in cases where the material facts are similar, the Magistrates\u2019 Court of Victoria and the County Court \nof Victoria are bound to follow precedents set by the Supreme Court of Victoria (Trial Division or Court of Appeal) or the High Court of Australia\n\u2022 for the Supreme Court of Victoria to be bound by a precedent, the precedent would need to be set in \nthe Victorian Court of Appeal or the High Court of Australia\n\u2022 being the highest court in Australia, the High Court is not bound by precedents set by any Australian state or territory/uni00A0court.\nPersuasive precedents\nPersuasive precedents are precedents that are not binding on a court but may still be considered by a judge and used to in\ufb02uence their decision. It may be an important legal principle which is relevant to the case before the court, highly regarded by the judge and used to guide or sway their decision. Persuasive precedents may/uni00A0be:material facts \nthe key facts or details in a legal case that were critical to the court\u2019s decision\nbinding precedent \nthe legal reasoning for a decision of a higher court that must be followed by a lower court in the same jurisdiction (i.e. court hierarchy) in cases where the material facts are similarShaddock sued Parramatta City Council for giving negligent advice, also referred to as \nnegligent misstatement.\nThe High Court decided that the council had given negligent advice because it did owe a \nduty of care to Shaddock (to provide accurate advice); it had breached that duty of care and was \ntherefore liable to pay damages.\nThe reason for the decision (ratio decidendi)/uni00A0was that: a duty of care is owed when information \nor advice is sought, and is relied upon, in the course of business and the supplier of information sets up as a centre from which that advice may be sought (that is, as an expert).\nThe remedy that was given as a result of this decision is not part of the ratio decidendi.\nThe VCE Legal Studies \nStudy Design requires you to know the role of the Victorian courts as well as the High Court in law-making. You might be asked specifically about the High Court, so make sure you understand its unique role in the process of law-making.Study tip\n13_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   426 10/10/2017   1:10 PM",

These \nprecedents are not binding, although in reality, in the interests of consistency, judges will almost inevitably follow them. One exception is the High Court. While the High Court will also usually follow its previous decisions in an attempt to maintain consistency, it will not do so if it no longer considers the precedent to be good law (e.g. the justices consider the law to be outdated due to changes in community attitudes, technologies or other circumstances that occur over/uni00A0time)   \n  \u2022      statements made as   obiter dicta   contained in a judgment of a court in the same hierarchy or in another \ncourt hierarchy.

He  denied that he  had \ndone this again, and stated that he had done nothing to  harm the/uni00A0child.\nThe medical expert called by the prosecution conducted a  post mortem and was  unable to  \nsay what caused the fatal haemorrhage.\nUnlike other cases referred to  in the judgment, there was  no evidence to  show that the \naccused was of unsound mind at the time of the death of the/uni00A0child.\nOne of the grounds of appeal was  that \u2018the learned trial judge erred in his directions to  the \njury in  failing to  direct the jury that in  relation to  the question of  unanimity of  verdict for a  finding \nof guilt the jury had to  be unanimous as to  the cause of death.\u2019\nThe Court of Appeal maintained that the jury\u2019s verdict was  unreasonable, in that it was  \nincapable of  being supported having regard to  the evidence presented by  the prosecution at  the \noriginal/uni00A0trial.\nThe Court of Appeal decided to  uphold the appeal against the conviction and ordered that \nKlamo be  acquitted.

This is called reversing a precedent. When a court reverses an earlier decision, in the same case  \non appeal, a new precedent is created by  the superior court\u2019s decision. The  new precedent becomes the \none to  follow in future/uni00A0cases.\nR v Klamo [2008] 18 VR 644 is an example of a case where the Court of Appeal reversed the decision \nof the Supreme Court.reversing a precedent \nwhen a superior court changes a previous precedent set by a lower  court in the \nsame case on appeal, thereby creating a new precedent which \noverrides the earlier precedentthe car  when in an unfit state.

So, for example, a precedent set by  the Trial Division of the \nSupreme Court in \u2018Case A\u2019  can be overruled by  the Victorian Court of Appeal in \u2018Case B \u2019.  In the same \nway, the High Court can overrule a precedent set by  a decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in a \ndi\ufb00erent/uni00A0case. \nSuperior courts can overrule an existing precedent set by  a lower court in an earlier and di\ufb00erent case \nbecause they are  not bound to  follow precedents created in lower courts.\nDisapproving a precedent\nWhen a lower court disagrees with an existing binding precedent set by  a superior court in the same \nhierarchy, it may  wish to  express its dissatisfaction with the previous precedent. This is referred to  as \ndisapproving a precedent. While this statement of discontent does not allow the lower court to  avoid \nfollowing the precedent, it may  encourage parliament to  change the law  or encourage a party to  consider \nlodging an appeal against the decision in a higher court. A/uni00A0statement of  disapproval, made as obiter dicta, \nmay also be used to  indicate to  a higher court that a judge in a previous case believed the precedent \nneeded to  be reconsidered.\nIn cases where judges are  not strictly bound by  precedents previously set by  their own  court they \nmay still choose to  follow it, while expressing their disapproval. This statement of disapproval may  then \nencourage a party to  the case to  appeal against the verdict in the hope that a superior court will reverse  \nthe decision. Similarly, it may  also encourage the parliament to  override or change the existing/uni00A0law.\nSometimes even  the High Court of Australia will express their disapproval of  an existing precedent \nrather than overruling it, in an e\ufb00ort to  convince the parliament to  change the law.  An example is provided \nbelow.disapproving a \nprecedent when a court e\nxpresses \ndissatisfaction of an existing precedent but is still bound to  follow itoverruling a precedent when a superior court changes a previous precedent, established by a lower  court, in \na different and later case thereby creating a new precedent which overrules the earlier precedent\nPrevious VCAA  Legal \nStudies Examination Reports have indicated that in the past some students have incorrectly explained what disapproving an existing precedent means.

Applying earlier precedents  \n  Most often, when resolving a case brought before them, the courts will be required to  consider and apply \nprecedents set in previous cases. Even if they do not distinguish, overrule, reverse  or disapprove of past \ndecisions, they may  still need to  re\ufb01 ne the law  and make it clearer as they apply a precedent to  a new case.  \nThis allows the law  to expand and develop over/uni00A0time.  \n  When applying previous precedents courts will sometimes be required to  interpret the meaning of  \nthe words and phrases used in the past precedents. This may  result in their meaning being broadened or \nnarrowed by  future courts. This is one reason why  it is often said that a precedent set by  a court is  never \na \ufb01 nal statement of the law  , because circumstances always  change.   \n  Over time, through reversing, overruling, distinguishing and disapproving, precedents have  been \nchanged and developed to  allow a gradual expansion of common law.

Such situations arise when there is a dispute over the meaning of the words and phrases contained in an Act of Parliament and the case is brought before the courts to be resolved. By giving meaning to the unclear words and phrases, judges can clarify legislation so it can be applied to resolve the dispute before them. Similarly, when interpreting legislation, judges can broaden or narrow its meaning. In doing so, the court establishes a legal principle to be followed in future similar cases which, together with the Act of Parliament, will form part of the/uni00A0law.\nFor a judge to be able to interpret a statute, and give meaning to unclear legislation, a case must be \nbrought before the court for resolution. Then, after the judge interprets the meaning of the disputed words or phrases in the Act of Parliament, the act can be applied to resolve the case at hand. Furthermore, depending on the superiority of the court, the legal reasoning behind the judge\u2019s interpretation may set a precedent that other judges can follow in future cases when required to interpret the meaning of those words or phrases in the same/uni00A0act.\nThe newly established precedent becomes a part of the law. It will be read along with the Act of \nParliament in future cases. It should be remembered, however, that the judge\u2019s interpretation of a statute provides only a statement about the meaning and application of the statute. It does not change the actual words or phrases used in the statute itself.\nThe VCE Legal Studies \nStudy Design requires you to know reasons for, and effects of, statutory interpretation. Make sure you know at least two reasons and at least two effects.Study tip\nSource 1 Judges are often called upon to interpret the meaning of words in legislation so it can be applied to resolve the dispute before/uni00A0them.\nReasons for/uni00A0statutory \ninterpretation\nThere are many reasons why courts are called upon to \ninterpret legislation. These problems can be divided into two broad categories:\n\u2022 pr oblems that occur as a result of the drafting process,/uni00A0and\n\u2022 pr oblems that occur when a court is applying the Act of \nParliament to resolve a/uni00A0case.\nProblems as/uni00A0a result of/uni00A0the \ndrafting process\nParliamentary counsel are lawyers who have the task of \npreparing and writing up bills to be presented and considered \nparliamentary counsel \nlawyers who are responsible for drafting bills in accordance with the policies and instructions of a member of parliamentby the parliament. These bills are written from policy documents and instructions from members of \nparliament (usually government ministers).\nWhen drafting bills, parliamentary counsel are generally required to ensure they cover a wide range \nof situations and possibilities. This means they must be careful with the language they use. Sometimes, parliamentary counsel will need to use general terms, to ensure the bill covers a wide range of future circumstances. At other times they will need to use precise terms that clearly de\ufb01ne the law being proposed so it cannot be misinterpreted. This makes drafting legislation a very complex task and creates a need for judges to interpret unclear legislation.\n13_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   438 10/10/2017   1:10 PM",
  "Page 451": "439  CHAPTER  13 THE COURTS EXAMPLEBelow is an example of why precise terms need to be used to clearly de\ufb01ne the law. \nWhat does \u2018supply\u2019 really mean?\nImagine a parliamentary counsel has been instructed by the government to draft a proposed \nlaw banning one individual from \u2018supplying illegal drugs to another\u2019. The everyday meaning of the word \u2018supply\u2019 is relatively clear. It means to hand over or deliver an item or satisfy a need. It conveys the idea of providing a good or a service that is wanted by, or meets the needs of, another person. But upon further examination, and when applied to different circumstances, the meaning of the word \u2018supply\u2019 may not be so clear. \nFor example, if Tony leaves illegal drugs in his friend Jason\u2019s car, and Jason returns the drugs, \nis Jason \u2018supplying\u2019 drugs and therefore committing a crime according to the draft law? Can returning the drugs to Tony be regarded as Jason \u2018supplying\u2019 drugs? Similarly, can a courier who is employed by Tony to deliver drugs to Jason be charged with \u2018supplying\u2019 drugs, or is Tony the \u2018supplier\u2019? If Tony places the drugs in a bank deposit box for safekeeping does this mean that the bank has been \u2018supplied\u2019 with/uni00A0drugs?\nProblems that could occur as a result of the drafting process are set out/uni00A0below.\n\u2022 Mistakes can occur during the drafting of a Bill \u2013 Parliamentary counsel may make mistakes \nwhen drafting a bill. For example, in 2016 the Victorian Parliament passed legislation to amend the \nCrimes Act 1958 (Vic) in relation to sexual o\ufb00ences. The previous law was mistakenly limited in scope, as it excluded sexual o\ufb00ences by means of technology. Changes to the law have made it an o\ufb00ence to use technology and applications such as Snapchat in a sexually o\ufb00ensive way.\nIn both of the cases below the speci\ufb01c wording of the law was called into question.\n\u2022 The act might not have taken future circumstances into account  \u2013 For example, the Australian \nConstitution gives the Commonwealth Parliament the power under Section 51(vi) to legislate over \u2018the \nnaval and military defence of the Commonwealth and of the several States, and the control of the forces to execute and maintain the laws of the Commonwealth\u2019 . This section does not refer to the air force because, at the time the Constitution was passed, powered aircraft had not been invented and the concept of an air force was not imagined.\n\u2022 The intention of the act might not be clearly expressed  \u2013 Sometimes a policy or instructions \nregarding the purpose or a proposed law may not be clearly expressed. This can lead to confusion about how it should be interpreted.\n\u2022 There might be inconsistent use of the same word in the act (giving it di\ufb00erent meanings)  \u2013  \nThis could occur within the act itself, or it could be caused by an amendment that is not consistent with \nthe original act in its use of a particular/uni00A0word.\n\u2022 An act may not cover new types of technology  \u2013 For example, an act referring to CDs and DVDs \nmay not include MP4 players.\n\u2022 Parliamentary counsel, when drafting the legislation, may have used incorrect technical/uni00A0terms.\n\u2022 There may be inconsistencies with other statutes.\u2022 A word in an act may not be de\ufb01ned in the/uni00A0act.\u2022 The de\ufb01nition of a word might be too broad in an/uni00A0act.\n13_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   439 10/10/2017   1:10 PM",

As a result, the meaning of some words might be ambiguous. It is \ntherefore necessary for  the courts to  interpret the words or phrases in order to  decide on their meaning \naccording to  the intention of the statute. For  example, in the case of   Davies v Waldron , the court was  \nasked to  interpret the phrase \u2018start to  drive\u2019 found in Sections 48 and 49 of  the  Road Safety Act  1986  Missing  comma  in a state  law costs  a US dairy  company\nIn 2017, a  judge in an  American court ruled that a US  dairy company, Oakhurst Dairy, owed  three \nof its  truck drivers four years of  wages for  unpaid overtime, because the state  law that listed the \ntasks that workers could not claim overtime payment for was missing a \u2018comma\u2019.\nUnder the state  law, workers were  not entitled to  claim overtime payment for  undertaking \ntasks including \u2018The canning, processing, preserving \u2026  storing, packing for  shipment or \ndistribution\u2019 of various foods. Not having a  comma after the phrase \u2018packing for  shipment\u2019 \nmeant that the job of \u2018packing for  shipment or distribution\u2019 was  one task. Given the truck \ndrivers did not \u2018 pack food for shipment or distribution\u2019 but rather just delivered the food, the \njudge ruled they were  not included in  the overtime exemptions outlined in  the relevant law and \nwere  as such entitled to  be paid overtime.\nWhile the case only involved three truck drivers, Oakhurst Dairy employed another 72 \ndrivers who, after the ruling, may  also be entitled to  the unpaid overtime. That amount was  \nestimated to  be approximately $US 10/uni00A0million.CASE \nSTUDY\nIn the legal case of Grace  v Fraser [1982] VR 1052 the magistrate had to  consider the purpose of an act.\nSource 2 A  \nmissing comma \nin state  law cost a \nUS dairy company\n13_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   440 10/10/2017   1:10 PM",

To  hold up  his trousers he was  wearing a  black leather belt, which he  had purchased \nearlier from a  stall at the market. The belt had raised silver studs on it. He was  charged with \nan offence under Section 6 of the Control of  Weapons Act.\nSection 6 of the Act stated:\n1 A person must not possess, carry or use any regulated weapon without lawful excuse.\n2 A person must not carry a  regulated weapon unless it is  carried in a  safe and secure manner \nconsistent with the lawful excuse for  which it is  possessed or is  carried or is to be  used/uni00A0for.\nSection 5  of the Control of  Weapons Regulations 1990 (Vic) provided a  long list of weapons \nthat were  included under the term \u2018regulated\u2019. This list included \u2018any article fitted with raised \npointed studs which is designed to  be worn as an article of clothing\u2019.\nThe court had to  interpret the words \u2018regulated weapon\u2019 as found in the Control of  Weapons \nAct and the Control of  Weapons Regulations, and then decide if regulated weapons included \nstudded/uni00A0belts.\nThe Magistrates\u2019 Court decided that a  studded belt was  a \u2018regulated weapon\u2019 as it fitted the \ndescription of one of the weapons listed in the Control of  Weapons Regulations.\nThe young man appealed against the Magistrates\u2019 Court\u2019s decision to  the Supreme Court. \nThe Supreme Court decided differently from the Magistrates\u2019 Court. The Supreme Court justice \nconcluded that the studded belt was not a regulated weapon.\nIn interpreting the meaning of  \u2018regulated weapon\u2019, Justice Beach looked to a  range of  sources \nincluding noting the literal meaning of the word  \u2018weapon\u2019 in the Oxford English Dictionary as \n\u2018an instrument of any kind used in warfare or in combat to  attack and overcome an enemy\u2019, \nand stated  that if this definition was  used by the court, \u2018weapon\u2019 could include any number \nof things such as pieces of timber or lengths of pipe. His Honour also looked for  assistance \nfrom Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, which defined \u2018offensive weapon\u2019 as \u2018anything that is not in common use for  any other purpose but that of a  weapon. But a  c\n ommon whip is not such a  \nweapon; nor probably a hatchet which is caught up accidentally during the heat of an affray\u2019.LEGAL  \nCASE\n13_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   441 10/10/2017   1:10 PM",
  "Page 454": "442 UNIT 4  THE PEOPLE AND THE LAWIn his judgment, Justice Beach referred to other previous cases that had \ninterpreted the words \u2018offensive weapon\u2019. In Wilson v Kuhl; Ryan v Kuhl [1979] VR \n315, Justice McGarvie stated:/uni00A0\u2018Any physical article is an offensive weapon if it is an \narticle of a kind normally used only to inflict or threaten injury \u2026 A/uni00A0person armed with an article of a kind normally used only to inflict or threaten injury is armed with an offensive weapon, whatever his intention. An article of a kind which is not normally used only to inflict or threaten injury is an offensive weapon only if the person found armed with it had then any intention to use it for an offensive, that is, an aggressive, purpose. A/uni00A0carving knife is an article of this/uni00A0kind.\u2019\nJustice Beach decided that under the Control of Weapons Act , a regulated weapon \nshould be defined as \u2018anything that is not in common use for any other purpose but that of a weapon\u2019. For example, a pair of stockings can be used as a weapon to \nstrangle someone, but it is not common or normal to use them in this way, therefore they could not be classed as a regulated weapon under the Control of Weapons/uni00A0Act .\nDeing v Tarola ratio decidendi\nThe Supreme Court set a precedent in this case. The ratio decidendi  in this case was \nthe following.\n\u2022 An item that is not in common use as a weapon cannot be classed as a weapon under the \nControl of Weapons/uni00A0Act.\n\u2022 The Executive Council (comprising the Governor of Victoria, Premier of Victoria and senior \nministers), when making the Control of Weapons Regulations, was outside the authority given \nto it by the Control of Weapons Act (ultra vires), therefore the regulation that lists studded \nbelts as \u2018weapons\u2019 was invalid.Source 3 In Deing v Tarola \nthe Supreme Court was required to decide on appeal whether wearing a studded belt could be interpreted as carrying a weapon.\n\u2192 GOING FURTHER\nMethods used by judges to interpret statutes\nOver the years judges have developed certain principles and guidelines to help them interpret \nstatutes. If the meaning of the words of an Act of Parliament is unclear to the courts, or the courts are unsure how to apply an act to a particular set of circumstances, they will look further than the act, to discover the intention of the parliament at the time the act was passed, so they can apply the act to the situation before them. The courts will also look back at past decisions to see how courts have interpreted the words in the act in previous/uni00A0cases.\nWhen judges are trying to discover the intention of parliament when it made an act, they can \nlook at a range of materials including:\n\u2022 materials contained in the act itself (referred to as intrinsic materials) including the use of the \nwords in both the section of the statute being interpreted and other sections, the long title, and \nheadings, margin notes, footnotes, punctuation,/uni00A0and\n\u2022 materials from sources outside the statute (referred to as extrinsic materials) including \nparliamentary debates (which are recorded in Hansard), reports from committees and law \nreform bodies, dictionaries and interpretation acts that specifically provide guidelines for judges when interpreting statutes.intrinsic material \nmaterial (i.e. information) found within an Act of Parliament that may assist a judge to interpret its meaning\nextrinsic material \nmaterial (i.e. information) that is not part of an Act of Parliament, but that may assist a judge to interpret the meaning of the Act\nHansard \nthe official transcript (i.e. written record) of what is said in parliament.

This will occur until the precedent created is extended, reversed or overruled by  a higher \ncourt or overridden by  parliament, which can pass a law  to cancel (abrogate ) a court\u2019s interpretation. \n\u2022 the meaning of the legislation (law) can  be restricted or expanded \u2013 If a court interprets a word  \nor phrase narrowly, this could restrict the scope of the law.  For example, the decision in Deing v Tarola \nrestricted the de\ufb01nition of a regulated weapon to  items likely to  be used for  an o\ufb00ensive or aggressive \npurpose only. Similarly, a broad interpretation of a word  or phrase in a statute can extend the meaning \nof legislation to  cover a wider range of circumstances or new area of  law. For example, the decision \nin the Tasmanian Dam case extended the interpretation and meaning of the phrase \u2018external a\ufb00airs\u2019 \nin the Australian Constitution to  include areas covered by  international treaties \u2013 thus allowing the \nCommonwealth Parliament to  make laws  in any  area covered by  an international treaty.\nThe finality of/uni00A0a court\u2019s decision\nWhen a law  is made through the courts, it applies to  parties to  the case and any  person who may  bring a \nsimilar\n case in the future.

  "Page 458": "UNIT 4  THE PEOPLE AND THE LAW 446THE DOCTRINE OF PRECEDENT 13.5 \nWhile the main role of the courts is to apply existing laws made by parliament to resolve disputes, the \ncourts have an important role to play in law-making. As we have examined, courts are able to make common law when a case is before them. However, while courts are able to make law, their ability to do so is sometimes limited. In this chapter you will look at \ufb01ve of the main factors that a\ufb00ect the ability of courts to make law,/uni00A0being:\n\u2022 the doctrine of precedent\u2022 judicial conservatism\n\u2022 judicial activism\n\u2022 costs and time in bringing a case to/uni00A0court\u2022 the requirement for standing.\nIn this topic you will explore the \ufb01rst of these factors, being the doctrine of precedent. The doctrine \nof precedent both enables and restricts the ability of courts to make/uni00A0laws.\nAs part of the doctrine of precedent, judges follow a process in which they follow the legal reasoning \nbehind the decisions of higher courts when resolving disputes. This application of precedents to current \ncases is an important factor that helps ensure common law is consistent and predictable. It is one of the ways in which the rule of law is upheld, providing some certainty in the way that laws are applied. \nHaving lower courts follow the legal reasoning established by higher courts in the same hierarchy, in \ncases where the material facts are similar, ensures/uni00A0that:\n\u2022  lik e cases are decided in a like manner. This enables the parties in a dispute to look back to previous \ncases to gain some idea of how a court might determine their/uni00A0case.\n\u2022  leg al representatives are able to give advice on the likely outcome of case, as they will have some \nunderstanding as to how the court may decide the/uni00A0case.\n\u2022  judg es have some protection and guidance, as they can refer back to previous cases and decide \naccordingly. \n\u2022  decisions made by more experienced judges in higher courts are followed in lower courts. \u2022  the same point is not being decided over and over again, which would be a waste of resources. \nThe doctrine of precedent does, however, also have limitations.\nIdentifying relevant \nprecedents\nWhile parties and judges can refer to earlier \nprecedents for guidance, it can be di\ufb03cult to locate precedents relevant to a particular case, due to the large number of cases that may have previously been decided in the particular area of law involved in the case. The large volume of existing precedents also means that \ufb01nding a relevant precedent can be time-consuming and costly. Adding to this, judgments can be written in technical language and judges may give more than one reason for their decision.The VCE Legal Studies \nStudy Design requires you to know five factors that affect the ability of courts to make law:/uni00A0the doctrine of precedent, judicial conservatism, judicial activism, the costs and time in bringing a case to court and the requirement for standing.Study tip\nSource 1 Judges refer to earlier precedents for guidance.

  "Page 459": "447  CHAPTER  13 THE COURTS Similarly, as we have already seen earlier in this chapter, identifying the legal reasoning behind a \ndecision (ratio decidendi) can be di\ufb03cult when the precedent has been established in a court of appeal \nwith three or more judges. In these cases, lawyers must look at the decisions from judges who decided in a similar way and formed the majority. Judges who do not agree with the majority are referred to as dissenting judges.\nIn some instances there will be con\ufb02icting authorities. This means there will be more than one judgment \non a particular issue, and most likely di\ufb00erences in their reasons for the decisions. If this occurs, the judge needs to decide which precedent is most appropriate to the set of circumstances before the/uni00A0court.\nBinding precedents\nThe doctrine of precedent may also restrict the ability of the courts to change the law in cases where the court is bound to follow a previous precedent established by a higher court. It may also lead to an unjust outcome if courts are bound to follow an \u2018outdated precedent\u2019 and the a\ufb00ected party cannot a\ufb00ord to pursue an appeal to a higher court. However, lower courts can express their disapproval of a binding \nprecedent which may encourage a dissatis\ufb01ed party to pursue an appeal to a higher court, and be used to indicate to a higher court that the lower court believed the precedent needed to be reconsidered.\nFlexibility\nA strength associated with the doctrine of precedent is that it is \ufb02exible and, in certain circumstances, allows courts to avoid following, or even to change, existing precedents. For example, higher courts can reverse (on appeal) or overrule previous precedents in a later case. Judges can also avoid following an existing precedent by distinguishing between the material facts of the case before the court and the material facts of the case in which the precedent was/uni00A0set.\nHowever, judges in superior courts may be reluctant to reverse or \noverrule existing precedents. For example, in the Trigwell case, the High \nCourt decided not to overrule an earlier precedent set by a state court of appeal preferring to leave the law-making to parliament in this/uni00A0area.\nSimilarly, judges in courts of the same standing, by convention, consider \ntheir own court\u2019s previous decisions to be highly persuasive and rarely overrule them (with the exception of the High Court, which will overrule its own decisions to allow the law to develop over time). Judges are not, however, bound to follow precedents from other hierarchies (such as interstate and overseas) or from lower courts in the same hierarchy.\nThe doctrine of precedent can also limit the ability of \ncourts to make law because judges must wait for a relevant case to be brought before them. Also, only the superior courts (the Victorian Supreme Court or higher) can make law. This means that the courts are reliant on parties being aware of their right to pursue a matter in the courts, being willing and able to a\ufb00ord to bring a case before the courts, and being determined to see the action through the appeals process (which is also costly and time-consuming). \nFurther, judges in superior courts are restricted to making law that is needed to clarify some issue or \nmatter raised in the case before them. Anything they say \u2018by the way\u2019 is obiter/uni00A0dicta.\nJudges can reverse precedents\nJudges can overrule\nprecedents\nJudges can distinguish the \nprecedent+ \u2013Reluctance to overrule\nMust wait for a case to come \nbefore them\nMust be required to clarify \nsome issue or matter\nSource 3 The pros and cons of the flexibility in the doctrine of \nprecedentSource 2 Judges of the Victorian Court of Appeal can overrule or reverse precedents set by the Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Victoria.\n13_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   447 10/10/2017   1:11 PM",

If the court is interpreting a statute, or considering a precedent, it can only clarify the meaning of the statute or change precedent after the dispute has come before the court. If the court is discussing a case law precedent, it can only clarify the meaning after \nthe dispute has come before the court.  Expansion of the law of negligence is an example. Before the \u2018negligent misstatement\u2019 cases such as the Shaddock case came before the court, no one knew how the courts would decide. Extending the law by interpreting the meaning of previous decisions more broadly allows the court to achieve a fair result for the successful party, but it also means the other party was acting within the law at the time of the incident. It is only later that the court \ufb01nds that they acted outside the/uni00A0law.\nParliament can override judge-made/uni00A0law\nWhile judges can make law through the establishment of precedents, with the exception of High Court decisions in constitutional matters, parliament can always legislate to override common law. This is because parliament is our supreme law-making body. This limits the ability of judges to make and change the law. \nFor example, in 2015 the Victorian Parliament passed legislation which amended laws about directions \ngiven by judges to juries. One of the amendments abolished an old common law rule that a judge can direct a jury that a complainant\u2019s delay in making a complaint about a crime may cast doubt on the reliability of the complainant\u2019s evidence, and that they can take this into account when deciding whether the complainant\u2019s evidence is credible. This was seen to be particularly prejudicial and harsh in relation to complainants of sexual o\ufb00ence crimes. In constitutional matters, however, parliament cannot override common law.\nSummary of the advantages and disadvantages of \nthe role of the courts in law-making\nA summary of the advantages and disadvantages of the role of the courts in law-making is set out in \nSource 4 below.\n13_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   448 6/12/2017   2:19 PM",

  "Page 462": "UNIT  4 THE PEOPLE AND THE  LAW 450JUDICIAL CONSERVATISM 13.6 \nJudges can hold di\ufb00erent views about the way  they should interpret the law.  Judicial conservatism \nrefers to  the idea that the courts should show restraint or caution when making decisions and rulings that \ncould lead to  signi\ufb01cant changes in the law.  Judicial conservatism in\ufb02uences the ability of the courts to  \nmake law,  because judges who take  a conservative approach to  the way  they interpret statutes will not go  \nvery far beyond the established/uni00A0law.\nParliament is the supreme law-making body, consisting of  members who are  elected by  the people \nto make laws  on their behalf. It is therefore generally accepted that the parliament has more authority for  \nimplementing major law  reform than judges, who are  not elected by  the people. Judges should interpret \nthe law,  not rewrite/uni00A0it.\nAn important feature of judicial conservatism is the belief that judges should ensure their decisions are  \nnot based on their own  views or political opinions. They  should also not base their decisions on what they  \nperceive to  be the community\u2019s view on a  given issue. Rather, they should base their decisions solely on legal  \nconsiderations. They  are in no position to  assume to  know or assess the community\u2019s views on a  particular  \nissue.  \nThis traditional view is opposite to  the concept of  judicial activism,  or the idea that judges should consider  \na range of social and political factors, like the views and values of the community and the need to  protect the  \nrights of the people, when interpreting Acts of Parliament and making decisions.

  "Page 463": "451  CHAPTER  13 THE  COURTS  Those  who support judges adopting a more progressive, creative or \u2018activist\u2019 approach argue that \nthe courts have  a duty to  broadly interpret Acts of Parliament in a way  that recognises the rights of the \npeople and address community concerns on a given matter. The  classic case of this kind is the Mabo case \n(discussed in Topic/uni00A013.7).\nBecause the High Court interprets the Constitution, those who favour judicial conservatism believe \nthe justices should limit their role as law\u2013makers when making rulings in constitutional disputes, and \nbe reluctant to  declare Acts of Parliament invalid unless they are  obviously unconstitutional. The  main \npurpose of judicial interpretation is to  give  e\ufb00ect to  what parliament intended when it passed the statute \nthat is being interpreted.\nThe majority decision in the case of  Rowe  v Electoral Commissioner [2010] 243 CLR 1 is considered by  \nsome to  be an example of the High Court taking an activist rather than a conservative approach.\nShannen Rowe  turned 18 but was unable to/uni00A0vote\nRowe  v Electoral Commissioner [2010] 243 CLR 1\nIn Australia, the federal election process formally commences with the issuing of writs by the Governor-General (usually after being approached by the prime minister), which specify the key dates of the election like the closing date for  individuals to  enrol to  vote  and candidates \nto nominate and the actually polling day.  In 2006, the Commonwealth Parliament passed an \namendment to  the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth) abolishing the right of an individual \nto have up to  seven days  after the issuing of the writs to  enrol to  vote. After this change a  \nperson had to  be enrolled to  vote prior to  the issuing of/uni00A0writs.\nOn Saturday 17 July 2010, the federal government announced an election would be held on \n21 August 2010. As  procedure required, the Governor-General issued the writs on  the following \nMonday 19 July 2010, and in accordance with the 2006 changes to  the Commonwealth Electoral \nAct, no enrolments to  vote  could be accepted after 8:00 pm on this date. Shannen Rowe,  who \nturned 18/uni00A0years of  age on  Friday 16  June, enrolled to vote  five days  after the issuing of  the writs \non Friday 23 July. Prior to  the 2006 amendments to  the Commonwealth Electoral Act, Rowe  \nwould have been eligible to  enrol to  vote. The amendments made her ineligible. This injustice \nled her to  challenge the amendments to  the Commonwealth Electoral Act.\nGiven the pending election, the High Court heard and delivered its  judgment relatively \nquickly. On 6  August 2010, the majority of High Court justices ruled (4 to  3 in favour) that the \namendments made to  the Commonwealth Electoral Act in 2006 were  invalid, allowing Rowe  to \nvote in the August election. The Court decided that the restrictions on  enrolling to vote  imposed \nby the 2006 amendments would limit the right of  the people to  elect the parliament, as  outlined \nin Sections 7  and 24 of the Constitution, which states  that members of both houses of the \nCommonwealth Parliament be \u2018directly chosen by the people\u2019.\nThe four justices who formed the majority decision were  regarded by some as more activist \nin their approach by recognising the right of the people to  elect the parliament, whereas the \ndecisions of  the three dissenting justices, who believed the requirement of  the parliament to be  \n\u2018directly chosen by  the people\u2019 had not been infringed by  the amendment to  the Commonwealth \nElectoral Act, were considered to  have adopted a more conservative approach.\nInterestingly, the reason why  the validity of the changes to  the Commonwealth Electoral Act \nwas not challenged at the time they were  made in 2006 was  because a  person must have a  \nstanding in  a case before it  can be brought before the courts. That is, a  person cannot challenge \nthe validity of legislation unless they have been directly affected by it. Rowe  was  not affected \nby the 2006 amendments until she was  denied enrolment in 2010. The ability of \u2018standing\u2019 to  \ninfluence the courts\u2019 capacity to  make law is examined later in this chapter.LEGAL  \nCASE\n13_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   451 6/12/2017   2:20 PM",

They prefer parliament to investigate and make contentious law reform. While parliaments are able to investigate the need for law reform, through a range of methods including parliamentary committees and specialist bodies like the Victorian Law Reform Commission (VLRC), the courts are not able to investigate the views of the public and are limited to examining the resources they have available in the court, with the exception of being able to consult extrinsic material when interpreting statutes. Courts are also limited to making law on issues or the part of the law that is the subject of the case before them whereas parliament can make laws for whole areas and in anticipation of future circumstances.

  "Page 465": "453  CHAPTER  13 THE COURTS 13.7 JUDICIAL ACTIVISM\nOf all the High Court \njustices, Michael Kirby has produced the most legal writing in general. He writes articles and essays on a wide range of social topics. He writes about things such as the connection between law and society, the role of judges and the purposes of judgment writing. Did you know?By the end of \nSeptember 2014, 242 of the 301 native title claims made throughout Australia resulted in rulings upholding the existence, or partial existence, of native title in the area claimed, meaning that native title rights exists over approximately 18% of Australia\u2019s land mass. However, most of the successful land claims have been over unwanted land; that is, land located in very remote areas of Australia, with very limited or no infrastructure (e.g. power, communication, roads and the like) and of little commercial/uni00A0value.Did you know?Over the years, the term judicial activism has been de\ufb01ned in many ways and therefore there is no \none clear de\ufb01nition. The term was \ufb01rst used in the United States back in the 1940s by an academic historian, Arthur Schlesinger Jr. He used it to refer to US Supreme Court judges who were willing to broadly interpret the rights protected in the US Constitution and make decisions to declare legislation that breached the civil rights of the American people invalid. The meaning of judicial activism then expanded to refer to judges who were willing to make rulings against the more politically conservative, or traditional mainstream view, in an attempt to protect the interests or rights of a minority party or/uni00A0group.\nIn recent years, the term judicial activism has been used to refer to the willingness of judges to consider \na range of social and political factors, including community views and values and the rights of the people, \nwhen interpreting the law and making decisions. Those who disapprove of judges taking a more active \nrole in determining and creating law have negatively de\ufb01ned judicial activism as judges making decisions arguably outside their legislative or constitutional power; for example, interpreting Acts of Parliament in a way that expands its meaning beyond the original intention of the parliament in an attempt to in\ufb02uence a change in the law. People who approve of judges taking a more active role use less negative terms such as \u2018progressive\u2019 rather than \u2018activist\u2019 .\nIn Australia, it was not until the 1990s that legal commentators, critics, politicians and the media \nstarted to question whether judicial activism was signi\ufb01cantly in\ufb02uencing court decisions and the ability of the courts to make law. In fact, one of the \ufb01rst major Australia cases that raised concern about judicial activism was the case of Mabo v Queensland (No. 2) (1992) 175 CLR 1 in which the justices of the High Court (6:1 in favour) made a signi\ufb01cant ruling to give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples land rights. More speci\ufb01cally, the High Court justices overturned the longstanding but false legal principle that Australia was an \u2018empty land belonging to no one\u2019 (terra nullius) before British colonisation. The Court legally recognised the right of Indigenous Australians to make claims over their traditional/uni00A0land.\nterra nullius \na Latin term meaning \u2018empty land\u2019; a false common law principle that Australia belonged to no one when the British first arrived in Australia to establish a colony in 1788\nSource 1 Federal Court Justice Gilmore on his way to a traditional Indigenous welcome to country before making a native title determination on the West Kimberley\u2019s Fitzroy River, Western Australia, in/uni00A02014. \n13_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   453 10/10/2017   1:11 PM",

The arrangement involved the Malaysian Government agreeing to  accept 800 asylum \nseekers, who were  being held in detention centres by the Australian Government after arriving \n\u2018unauthorised\u2019 into Australia, in return for  the Australian Government agreeing to  take  in 4000 \nrefugees who were awaiting re-settlement in Malaysia.\nThe proposed agreement caused great controversy  in Australia. Many refugee, human rights \nand legal organisations believed the proposal was  inhumane, against the spirit of  the Convention \nRelating to  the Status of  Refugees, also known as  the Refugee Convention (under which Australia \nhas agreed to  treat refugees and asylum seekers with respect and compassion) and in breach \nof the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), which among other obligations, requires asylum seekers who \narrive in Australia to  have legal protection from further persecution.\nWhen determining a  case in 2011, that challenged the legality of the Federal Government\u2019s \n\u2018Malaysian solution\u2019 proposal, the High Court exercised judicial activism, ruling that the \nproposal breached the existing Migration Act and was  therefore illegal. The ruling recognised \nthe right of Australian asylum seekers and increasing community concern over  the relatively \nharsh treatment of asylum seekers.\nInterestingly, after the prime minister at the time, Julia Gillard, criticised the High Court\u2019s \nruling stating that the High Court had missed the opportunity to  send a  message to  people \nsmugglers (those who engage in the illegal transporting of people for  profit) that Australia\u2019s \nstrict asylum seeker policies would undermine their illegal activities, the then Chief Justice French defended the court\u2019s decision and its  independence by stating the ruling was  based on \nthe application of the law and not influenced by party politics.LEGAL  \nCASEAt the time of the Mabo decision some critics viewed it as a very  clear example of improper judicial \nactivism. They  said the High Court was  exercising excessive judicial creativity by  establishing a law  \nbased on the political and social desire to  establish land rights and recognise the rights of Indigenous \nAustralians. Some even  went so  far as to  say the ruling diminished the objectivity of the court. Many \nothers, by  contrast, including the Federal Government of the day,  celebrated the ruling and praised the \nHigh Court justices for  acting with impartiality and courageously overruling the outdated and false legal \nprinciple of terra nullius.\nThe extent to  which judges should be progressive (or activist) when making decisions and establishing \nprecedents is controversial and largely depends on the circumstances of the case before the court. While some people may  consider judicial activism and the willingness of  judges to  consider the need to  \nuphold rights and recognise community values when making law  as judges overstepping their role \nas independent law\u2013makers, others view it as a legitimate obligation of the court that must be exercised by judges to  ensure justice is achieved.\nIn the Malaysia Solution case below the High Court exercised judicial activism by  ruling against the \nfederal government\u2019s agreement.\n13_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   454 10/10/2017   1:11 PM",

For example, lawyers need to conduct research into the case, including researching previously established relevant precedents that may be used as either binding or persuasive on a court, analyse evidence and documents, interview and prepare witnesses, and present legal arguments and evidence to the court in accordance with the strict rules of evidence and procedure. A/uni00A0party that is unrepresented will be at a distinct disadvantage and the high cost of legal representation can particularly discourage people who wish to take a civil issue to court, in which precedents can be established and changed. At the same time, however, the costs involved can discourage people who have frivolous or trivial claims from using the courts to pursue those claims. The costs will also encourage people to use alternative dispute resolution methods such as mediation to resolve their claims.\nCourt fees\nLodging a civil case with a court incurs a number of costs including \ufb01ling fees, hearing fees and jury costs. These costs can be expensive. For example, from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2018 an application for leave to appeal to the Victorian Supreme Court of Appeal cost $3661.70, and hearing fees cost $1450.40 for every day or part day, after the \ufb01rst day. If a party requests a jury in the Supreme Court, it will cost $772.10 for the \ufb01rst day, $554.40 per day for days two to six, and $1100.40 a day from day seven onwards. These fees increase on a yearly basis.\nTime involved in/uni00A0bringing a case to/uni00A0court\nOne of the strengths associated with courts making law is that the courts have the ability to make law relatively quickly once a dispute has been brought before/uni00A0them.\nFor example, once a case is brought before a superior court, where precedents are set, the matter must \ncontinue until a decision has been made and the dispute resolved. Furthermore, judges are not required to follow lengthy procedures like those involved in the process of developing, drafting and passing a bill through parliament, including the bill being examined in general terms and great detail by both houses fairness \none of the principles of justice; fairness means having fair processes and a fair hearing (e.g. the parties in a legal case should have an opportunity to know the facts of the case and have the opportunity to present their side of events; and the pre-hearing and hearing (or trial) processes should be fair and impartial)\nequality \none of the principles of justice; equality means people should be equal before the law and have the same opportunity to present their case as anyone else, without advantage or disadvantage\naccess \none of the principles of justice; access means that all people should be able to understand their legal rights and pursue their case\nlitigant \na person who takes a matter before the court to be resolved\nlegal aid \nlegal advice, education or information about the law and the provision of legal services (including legal assistance and representation)\ninjunction a remedy in the form of a court order to do something or not to do something.

In  simple terms, the legal action, which was  initiated by  the Human Rights \nLaw Centre and Stacks Goudkamp Solicitors on  behalf of a  Bangladeshi asylum seeker, aimed \nto challenge the constitutional validity of the Australian Government\u2019s policy to  forcibly send \nand hold asylum seekers in offshore detention centres.\nThe female asylum seeker who was  the focus of the dispute was  \nbeing treated by the Australian Government as an unauthorised asylum seeker (who arrived by boat) who could be held in an offshore detention centre. This was  despite her being confirmed as a  genuine refugee by  the \nGovernment of Nauru and brought to  Australia, for  a brief period of time, \nto receive medical treatment.\nWhile the consequences of this case were  important, and as such \nthe case could not be rushed through the courts, the woman involved and other affected parties had to  wait approximately nine/uni00A0months from \nthe time the High Court application was  made in May  2015 to  the final \njudgment handed down in February/uni00A02016.LEGAL  \nCASE\nSource 1 In 2016, the Australian \nGovernment forcibly held asylum seekers in offshore detention centres in  Nauru and \nPapua New Guinea.\nWhen an urgent injunction is needed or there is a pressing need at  a high level of community \nimportance, courts can move  quickly because judges have  discretionary power and can make rulings \nquickly (on the spot if necessary).

The ACT \nAct permitted same-sex marriage ceremonies to \ncommence from 7  December 2013. However,  on 12 \nDecember 2013, after the Commonwealth Government challenged the ACT  legislation, the High Court ruled LEGAL  \nCASEof parliament. Judges can, by  contrast, make decisions relatively quickly to  resolve a case and create law,  \nalthough judges in appeal courts, where most precedents are  established, can take  months to  hear and \ndetermine more/uni00A0complex cases.\nBelow is an example of  how  judges in appeal courts can take  a long time to  hear more complex cases.\nSource 2 In 2013, Stephen Dawson \nMP and Dennis Liddelow became the first same-sex couple to  lawfully marry \nin Australia. Five days later, their marriage was declared invalid by High Court ruling.\n13_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   457 10/10/2017   1:11 PM",

The driver, Alex  Allen, who had only \nmoments before chosen to  take  over  driving from Chadwick, was  estimated to  have a  blood \nalcohol reading of .229 per cent, well over  the legal limit of .05, at the time of the incident.\nIn August 2012, Chadwick successfully sued Allen for  negligence. However,  while the trial \njudge ruled in  her favour he  did reduce the amount of  damages awarded after finding Chadwick \ncontributed to  her injuries by  failing to  wear a  seatbelt. Chadwick filed an  appeal, claiming that \nafter Allen chose to  take  over  driving the vehicle, he  drove  so erratically that she was  unable to  \nsecure her seatbelt.\nIn November 2014, the appeal court found in favour of Chadwick and reversed  the decision \nof/uni00A0the trial judge with regard to  the contributory negligence. Allen then pursued the matter \nfurther by seeking leave to  appeal to  the High Court of Australia.\nIn December 2015, nearly eight years after the incident occurred, the High Court finally \nresolved the case, by agreeing with the original trial judge that while Allen was  negligent, his \ndriving did not prevent Chadwick from putting on her seatbelt and as such her failure to  do \nso amounted to  contributory negligence.

  "Page 472": "UNIT  4 THE PEOPLE AND THE  LAW 460THE REQUIREMENT OF STANDING 13.9 \nCourts must wait until a party decides to  pursue a case before they can create precedent. A/uni00A0party cannot \ntake a case to  a court unless the court has jurisdiction (power to  hear those matters). \nIn addition, the party initiating the case must have  standing (sometimes referred to  as locus standi) \nin the case to  be able to  pursue it. That  is, the party must be directly a\ufb00ected by the issues or matters \ninvolved in the case to  have  the right to  commence a legal proceeding in court. They  must have  su\ufb03cient \nor special interest in a case to  \u2018stand before the court\u2019 and be heard. Having a \u2018special interest\u2019 in the case \nmeans that they must be explicitly more a\ufb00ected by  the law or issues in dispute than a member of the \ngeneral public. For  example, the party initiating the action must stand to  gain a quanti\ufb01able advantage \n(such as standing to  gain money or property rather than just the satisfaction of winning), if they succeed \nin the action. \nThe leading case on standing, Australian Conservation Foundation Inc. v Commonwealth (1980) \n146/uni00A0CLR/uni00A0493, is discussed below.locus standi \na Latin term meaning \u2018standing in a case\u2019; that is, the litigant must be directly affected by the issues or matters involved in the case for the court to  be able to  \nhear and determine the case\nThe standing of a conservation/uni00A0body\nAustralia Conservation Foundation Inc. v Commonwealth (1980)  \n146 CLR/uni00A0493\nIn this case a  proposal was  made to  establish and operate a  resort and tourist area in central \nQueensland. Approval was  given by the Commonwealth Government under the Environment \nProtection (Impact of  Proposals) Act 1974 (Cth). \nThe purpose of the legislation was to  protect the environment. The Australia Conservation \nFoundation (ACF) challenged the approval, saying the statement did not comply with the required \nadministrative procedures. \nThe ACF  argued that it  had the right to  sue because of its  well-known interest in  conservation \nof the environment. \nThe question was  whether the ACF  was  entitled to  challenge the validity of the decision. No \nright of  the ACF  had been violated, and there was no  special damage to  the ACF  that would give \nthem standing.\nA majority of the High Court justices held that the ACF  did not have standing to  maintain \nthe action and it should be dismissed. The High Court held that in cases which do not concern constitutional validity, a  person who does not have a  special interest in the subject matter of \nan action (i.e. more than some member of the general public) has no standing to  sue for  an injunction to  prevent the violation of a  public right \nor to  enforce the performance of a public/uni00A0duty.\nJustice Gibbs said \u2018 It is quite clear that an ordinary member of the \npublic, who has no interest other than that which any member of the public has in upholding the law, has no standing to  sue to  prevent the \nviolation of a  public right or to  enforce the performance of a  public/uni00A0duty.\u2019\nJustice Stephen said \u2018If the present state  of the law in Australia is \nto be changed, it is pre-eminently a  case for  legislation, preceded by \ncareful consideration and report, so that any need for  relaxation in the \nrequirements for  locus standi may  be fully explored and the limits of \ndesirable relaxation precisely defined.\u2019LEGAL  \nCASE\nSource 1 Woodchips are still sent overseas \nfrom Australia.

  "Page 473": "461  CHAPTER  13 THE COURTS  Anyone who wishes to  bring a case to  court must have  standing, regardless of the court. However, \nthe issue of standing is particularly important in the High Court in cases that involves challenging a \nCommonwealth law.  This is because the High Court generally only hears cases where a person has a \n\u2018special interest\u2019 \u2013 meaning they are  more a\ufb00ected than other members of the general public. They  must \nshow they are  more a\ufb00ected by  the law  and will gain a greater material advantage (more than just winning) \nif the action succeeds, or will su\ufb00er a greater material disadvantage (more than just losing) if the action \nfails, than a member of the general public.\nIn the case below the High Court refused to  make a ruling because the plainti\ufb00 had no \u2018special interest\u2019 \nand was  not explicitly a\ufb00ected by  the law.\nThe anti-bikie laws/uni00A0case\nKuczborski v State of  Queensland (2014) 254/uni00A0CLR/uni00A051\nIn 2014, a  member of  the Gold Coast Hells Angel\u2019s Motorcycle club, Stefan Kuczborski, launched \na test  case in  the High Court of  Australia on  behalf of 17  \u2018outlawed\u2019 motorcycle clubs. The case \nchallenged the constitutional validity of a  range of  \u2018anti-bikie\u2019 laws that were  introduced by  the \nQueensland Government in September/uni00A02013.\nIn simple terms, Kuczborski believed that a  range of laws, including the Vicious Lawless \nAssociation Disestablishment Act 2013 (Qld) (VLAD) and the Criminal Law (Criminal Organisations \nDisruption) Amendment Act 2013 (Qld) breached basic human rights (such as  the right to  freedom \nof movement and association). These laws were  introduced by the Queensland Government to  \nprotect the community from members of criminal organisations who commit serious crimes.\nFor example, Kuczborski argued the laws breached the right to  freedom of  association. The \nlaws aimed to  make it difficult for  \u2018declared criminal \norganisations\u2019 (which included over  25 bikie clubs \nlike the Bandidos, Finks, Hells Angels and Rebels) to  \norganise criminal activities and recruit new  members \nby banning three or more of these individuals from meeting in a public/uni00A0place.\nIn short, Kuczborski lost  his case because the High \nCourt refused to  make a  ruling on  the grounds that he  \nhad \u2018no standing\u2019 in the case and therefore no right to challenge the laws through the Court. Basically, \nthe High Court held that because Kuczborski had not been charged with any crimes under the new  \u2018anti-\nbikie\u2019 laws, he had no real or \u2018special interest\u2019 in the subject matter of the case and as such the Court could not rule on  whether the laws breached his legal \nrights.\nWhile the ruling potentially allowed for  another \nperson who was  ultimately charged under the new  \nlaws (and therefore deemed to have a standing \nin the case) to  mount another legal challenge, it \ndemonstrated the difficulty and limited ability of individuals to  challenge the validity of a  law if they \nbelieved it  breached their basic rights and freedoms.

The bishops \nbrought the action on the basis that the ruling was against their religious beliefs. \nThe High Court ruled the bishops did not have standing in the case because they had no \nlegal, financial (economic) or special interest in the case. Winning the case would not result \nin the bishops gaining a  material advantage and losing the case would not cause them any \ndisadvantage other than a  sense of dissatisfaction and the costs  involved in mounting the \nchallenge.

As we  have  seen throughout this chapter, \nparliament is the supreme law-making body, but courts have  a complementary role to  parliament in \nmaking laws.

For  example, the Magistrates\u2019 Court Act  has been amended \nnearly every  year since it was  passed including amendments to  create its specialist lists (like the Sexual \nO\ufb00ences List) and divisions (like the Koori Court Division, the Drug Court Division and the Family \nViolence Court Division).\nAs the supreme law-making body parliament is also able to  pass Acts of Parliaments that restrict \nthe ability of the courts to  make decisions with respect to  certain matters. However, in accordance with \nthe separation of powers, parliament must ensure that it allows the courts to  remain independent and \nretain the power to  determine if the parliament has passed laws  beyond its law-making authority. For  \nexample, the courts are  restricted in the sentences they can give  by the maximum sentences prescribed in \nlegislation, current court sentencing practices relating to  the various o\ufb00ences and mandatory minimum \nsentences.\nAn example of the Victorian Government introducing an act which restricted the ability of the courts \nto make decisions regarding the sentencing of o\ufb00enders can be found below.Koori Court \na division of the Magistrates\u2019 Court, Children\u2019s Court and County Court that (in certain circumstances) operates as a sentencing court for Aboriginal people accused of committing crimes\nmandatory minimum \nsentence the minimum sanction, prescribed by the parliament in legislation, that must be imposed by the court\nMandatory  minimum  sentences\nIn 2016, the Victorian Government passed the Crimes Amendment (Carjacking and Home Invasion) \nAct/uni00A02016 (Vic). The Act restricted the ability of judges when imposing sentences for  aggravated \nhome invasion (a crime where three or more offenders, armed with a  weapon illegally enter \npremises to  commit theft knowing or not considering whether or not people are  home) by \nmandating or making it compulsory for  judges to  impose a  minimum three-year non-parole \nperiod on convicted offenders.\nLegislation that imposes mandatory sentencing is controversial as it removes the ability of \nthe judge, to a  certain extent, to  consider a  range of  factors when imposing the sentence. These \nfactors include the offender\u2019s personal history and circumstances, regardless of whether it \nwas a first  offence and whether the offender showed remorse, pleaded guilty, cooperated with \nthe police and the like. It is also claimed that it may  amount to  the parliament imposing on the \nindependence of  judiciary by  restricting the court\u2019s ability to  apply legislation based on  the rule \nof law and achievement of justice.\nThe ability of/uni00A0courts to/uni00A0influence parliament\nCourts have  the ability to  indirectly in\ufb02uence parliament to  make and change the law.  Judges may  make \ncomments when handing down judgments, either as part of the reasons for  their decision or as obiter dictum, \nthat inspire or encourage parliament to  initiate law  reform. Parliament can also be in\ufb02uenced to  change \nthe law  if a court is bound by  previous precedent and makes a decision that creates an injustice, or if a \ncourt acts in accordance with the principle of judicial conservatism and is unwilling to  overrule or reverse  \na previous precedent, preferring parliament to  investigate and initiate law  change. For  example, in the \nTrigwell case,  the High Court was  reluctant to  set a new precedent that landowners should be responsible \nfor damage caused by  their stray animals but stated that the law  should be changed by  the parliament.\nA court\u2019s decision may  also highlight a problem or even  cause public uproar that can lead to  the \nparliament changing the law.  This occurred in response to  an increase in the incidence of \u2018one punch\u2019 killings \nin Victoria, including the death of David Cassai from a one-punch attack, and the perceived dissatisfaction with the sentences being imposed by  the courts on o\ufb00enders, as highlighted on the next page.CASE \nSTUDY\n13_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   465 10/10/2017   1:11 PM",
  "Page 478": "466 UNIT  4 THE PEOPLE AND THE  LAWAs we  examined earlier in this chapter, judicial activism can also in\ufb02uence parliament to  change the \nlaw. For example, the High Court took an activist approach when determining the Mabo case.  It decided \nto overrule a long-established common law  principle that Australia was  terra  nullius (\u2018empty land\u2019) \nwhen it was  colonised by  the British. In doing so it recognised the right of  Aboriginal and Torres Strait \nIslander peoples to  have  native title over  their traditional land. Likewise, in 2011, the Malaysia Solution \ncase (examined on page  454) forced the Australian Government to  change their asylum seeker policy.\nThe interpretation of/uni00A0statutes by/uni00A0courts\nFor legislation to  be e\ufb00ective, the courts must apply the statutes to  the cases brought before them. To  do \nthis, it is sometimes necessary for  a court to  interpret or give  meaning to  the words or phrases in an Act  \nof Parliament. Courts may  also be called upon to  interpret the meaning of  secondary legislation, so  it \ncan be applied to  resolve disputes before/uni00A0them.\nBy giving meaning to  the unclear words and phrases in statutes, judges can not only clarify legislation \nso it can be applied to  resolve the dispute before them; they can also broaden or narrow its meaning. This \nestablishes a precedent that is followed in future similar cases and, together with the Act  of Parliament, \nforms a part of the/uni00A0law.\nThe High Court has a particularly important role in statutory interpretation. It is the only court \nwith the constitutional authority to  interpret the meaning of the words and phrases in the Australian \nConstitution. It can therefore alter the division of power between the Commonwealth Parliament and the \nstate  parliaments.\nFor the courts to  be able to  interpret the meaning of the words or phrases in an Act  of Parliament, \nhowever, a case must be brought before the court. As we  have  seen earlier in this chapter, and in Chapters/uni00A05 \nand 8, this can be a very  expensive, time-consuming and stressful exercise, and a person needs to  have  \nstanding to/uni00A0do/uni00A0so.Mandatory sentencing for \n\u2018one punch\u2019 attacks\nDPP v Closter [2014] VSC 484 (2 \nOctober/uni00A02014)\nIn September 2014, \u2018one punch\u2019 laws were  \nintroduced into Victoria just one week after \nDylan Closter was  sentenced to  nine years and \nthree months in prison, with a  minimum term \nof six years for  killing David Cassai in a  one-\npunch attack in Rye  on New  Year's Eve  2012. \nUnder Victorian law it is now  mandatory for  \nthose found guilty of a  fatal one-punch attack \nto serve a  minimum of ten  years in jail before \nbeing eligible for  parole.

This is referred to  as codi\ufb01cation of common law  and involves the parliament passing legislation \nthat reinforces or endorses the principles established by  the court in their ruling.\nFor example, the Commonwealth Parliament codi\ufb01ed (i.e. passed an Act  of Parliament to  reinforce \nor enshrine the principles established in the Mabo case). This included the recognition of land rights for  \nIndigenous Australians, in the Native Title Act/uni00A01983 (Cth). The  Mabo case and the principles that were  \nestablished are  explained below.\nThe Mabo/uni00A0case\nMabo v Queensland (No. 2)/uni00A0(1992) 175/uni00A0CLR/uni00A01\nIn 1992, the High Court ruled that the common law of Australia recognised the right of \nIndigenous Australians to  make claims over  their traditional land and be granted native title to  \nland. The judgment overturned a  common \nlaw principle that had existed up until this \ntime, based on an old  false seventeenth-\ncentury belief referred to  as terras nullius, \nthat Australia was  an \u2018empty land\u2019 and \nbelonged to  no one when the British first  \narrived and established colonisation in  the \nlate/uni00A01700s.\nIn 1982, five men who were  members \nof the Meriam people, Eddie Koiki Mabo, Sam Passi, David Passi, Celuia Mapo Salee and James Rice, joined together to have their traditional ownership of the \nisland of Mer in the Torres Strait legally recognised. The case, which became known as the Mabo case, was  brought as \na test  case to  determine the legal rights of  \nthe Indigenous Meriam people.\nThe Mabo case officially began in May  \n1982 when the group of Meriam men, led  \nby Eddie Mabo, lodged the action against the Queensland Government and the Commonwealth of Australia in the High Court.\nOn 3 June 1992, after a 10-year \nstruggle, the High Court gave its  ruling in \nthe Mabo case finding in favour of Mabo \nand establishing native title land rights for the Meriam people.

Sadly though, Eddie Mabo and Celuia Salee both died before the final decision was reached.\nIn the Mabo case, the High Court set the precedent that the native title of Indigenous \nAustralians could continue to exist and be legally recognised in situations/uni00A0where:\n\u2022 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples had maintained their connection with the \nland through the years of European settlement, although native title was extinguished if the Aboriginal clan or group had ceased to acknowledge traditional laws and lost its connection to the/uni00A0land\n\u2022 native title had not been extinguished by valid Acts of state or Commonwealth parliaments\n\u2022 the content of native title could be determined according to the traditional laws and customs \nof the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.The consequences of the Mabo decision \nare far-reaching, with the most important being that Australia now recognises the right of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders peoples to native title.\nIn 1993, following the High Court decision in Mabo v Queensland (No. 2), the Commonwealth \nParliament passed the Native Title Act, to confirm and enshrine the High Court\u2019s decision in \nlegislation and establish procedures for dealing with and settling native title claims.\nThe purpose of the Native Title Act/uni00A0is/uni00A0to:\n\u2022 provide for the recognition and protection of native/uni00A0title\n\u2022 establish ways in which future dealings affecting native title may proceed and to set \nstandards for those dealings\n\u2022 establish a mechanism for determining claims to native/uni00A0title\u2022 provide for, or permit, the validation of past Acts, and intermediate period Acts, invalidated \nbecause of the existence of native title.Source 4 Eddie Mabo, whose successful High Court challenge saw the legal recognition of native title \nland rights for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.\n13_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   468 10/10/2017   1:11 PM",

A/uni00A0society in \nwhich people respect and obey the law will be more peaceful and have greater social cohesion than a lawless society where everyone does what they/uni00A0like.\nClearly stated laws are therefore needed to provide guidelines of acceptable behaviour to prevent or \nminimise con\ufb02ict within society. Given that con\ufb02ict will inevitably arise, the law must also provide ways to resolve disputes.\nTo be e\ufb00ective, laws need/uni00A0to:\n\u2022 be known by the community\n\u2022 be easily understood\u2022 be able to be changed\u2022 be acceptable to individuals within society and society as a/uni00A0whole\u2022 be enforceable.\nThese are characteristics of e\ufb00ective laws. If a law is missing one or more of these characteristics, it \nprobably will not be e\ufb00ective.\nFurthermore, if a law does not re\ufb02ect the views and values held by the majority of people within \nsociety, people may be inclined to ignore or even break it. It is therefore essential that laws can be altered \nto keep up with current community views and values (as well as other changes that take place within society). The process of changing the law is referred to as law reform. Law reform must continually take place to ensure our laws remain relevant and e\ufb00ective.\nThere are many reasons why law reform is necessary. These include:\n\u2022 changes in beliefs, values and attitudes\n\u2022 changes in social, economic and political conditions\u2022 advances in technology\u2022 greater need for protection of the community\u2022 greater awareness of the need to protect rights\u2022 greater need to provide improved access to the law\u2022 encouraging changes in values in society\u2022 greater need to clarify, simplify or expand unclear laws.\nA brief explanation of each of these reasons, with examples, is provided below.\nChanges in/uni00A0beliefs, values and attitudes\nIn any society, values and attitudes change over time. If the law is to remain relevant and acceptable \nto the majority of people, it must keep up with \u2013 and re\ufb02ect \u2013 these changes. On the other hand, rapid changes to the law, which impose change before the community is ready to accept it, may be met with resistance. While most people in our community are generally law-abiding citizens, they will be reluctant to believe in \u2013 and obey \u2013 laws that do not re\ufb02ect their basic beliefs and standards. \nSometimes community values change as knowledge increases and society becomes more educated \nand aware. For example, community views on the banning of cannabis have changed over time as the bene\ufb01ts of using small amounts of marijuana to relieve severe pain have become more widely known. As a result, Victorian laws have been changed to allow for the use of medical cannabis to treat certain types of severe illnesses such as multiple sclerosis and epilepsy.The VCE Legal Studies \nStudy Design expects you to know examples of the reasons for law reform. You should create a folder and start collecting examples of law reforms. For each example you should:\n\u2022 explain the actual \nchange in the/uni00A0law\n\u2022 outline the reasons \nfor the law/uni00A0reform\n\u2022 examine the pros \nand cons of the law \nreform.\nYou should also \nkeep a list of proposed \nchanges in the law.

  "Page 487": "475  CHAPTER  14 LAW REFORM  Likewise, as society has become more aware  of the health risks associated with smoking, our  \nattitudes towards  smoking and the tobacco industry have  changed. A/uni00A0range of anti-smoking laws  have  \nbeen introduced throughout Australia. In 2007, Victoria\u2019s law  was  changed to  prohibit smoking in  \nenclosed public place (e.g. restaurants and o\ufb03ce buildings).  \nChanging a law  because of changing values, beliefs or views can, however, result in another problem \nthat requires additional law  reform. For  example, when smoking was  banned inside public buildings, \nworkers who smoked would go  outside for  a cigarette and hang round the doorways, creating clouds \nof smoke for  others to  walk through. The  Tobacco Amendment Act  2016 (Vic) made further amendments \nto the laws.  Smoking in certain outdoor dining areas is prohibited, and the sale, promotion and use of  \ne-cigarettes and products are  now  regulated. \nThe price paid by  individuals to  achieve these laws  is a loss of personal freedom to  smoke anywhere \nthey like. However, the restrictions were  for the greater good of society. At \ufb01rst some smokers complained, \nbut people have  adjusted to  the new laws.  In this way  changes in the law  can encourage further changes \nin values./uni00A0\nSociety\u2019s increasing awareness of animal welfare issues has resulted in Australian laws  being changed \nto help prevent animal cruelty. \nOscar\u2019s/uni00A0Law\nIn recent decades, public awareness of animal welfare issues in Australia has increased \ndramatically and people have become more concerned with protecting the rights of animals. As a  result of these changing attitudes, our laws have also changed in an attempt to  reduce \ncruelty to  animals and offer them protection under the/uni00A0law. \nSince 2010, a  number of laws have been changed or introduced in Victoria to  help prevent  \ncruelty to  dogs and cats.  In particular, laws to  regulate the activities of  so-called \u2018puppy factories\u2019  \nhave received much media attention. \u2018Puppy factories\u2019 are  businesses that mass-produce  \npuppies, often in poor and overcrowded conditions, so they can  be sold at a  profit. The laws  \nregulating puppy factories are  referred to  as Oscar\u2019s Law after a  dog named \u2018Oscar\u2019, who was  \nrescued by  animal welfare campaigner Debra Tranter after being badly treated in a  puppy factory.\nOver recent years the government \nhas examined altering existing animal protection laws to  regulate breeding and \nthe sale of dogs and cats  in pet shops, \nalthough change is slow.  For example, \nthe Domestic Animals Amendment (Puppy Farms and Pet  Shops) Bill 2016 \n(Vic) failed to pass through Victorian \nParliament due to strong objections \nfrom breeders./uni00A0 The Bill was  aimed at \nlimiting the number of fertile female dogs that can  be kept by commercial \nbreeders and further regulating the advertising and sale of dogs and cats  in \npet/uni00A0shops.CASE \nSTUDY\nSource 1 When rescued, Oscar weighed only 1.6 kilograms. After being \ntreated by a vet and adopted by a loving carer, he became the \u2018poster boy\u2019 for a campaign to  abolish puppy factories.\nIn the past, the right to  equal treatment before the law  has not extended to  LGBTIQ people. However, \nthis is gradually changing.\n14_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   475 10/10/2017   1:34 PM",
  "Page 488": "476 UNIT  4 THE PEOPLE AND THE  LAWEquality  for LGBTIQ/uni00A0people\nOver the years there has been a  gradual shift in recognition and understanding of members \nof our community who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer (i.e. LGBTIQ \npeople). Many people have become more accepting of  same-sex relationships, and many laws \nhave changed to  give LGBTIQ people the same rights as heterosexual people.\nThe Relationships Act 2008 (Vic) was  introduced to  allow two  adults (regardless of their gender)  \nwho are  not married to  each other but are  a couple (according to stated  conditions) to  register as  \nbeing in a \u2018domestic relationship\u2019 with the Victorian Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages.\nBy registering, the couple gain legal proof of their relationship for  the purposes of \nVictorian/uni00A0law.\nIn 2016, this law was  amended so that couples that have their relationship formally \nrecognised in  other states of  Australia or  had married in  countries that have legally recognised \nsame-sex marriages (e.g. Canada, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Scotland and South Africa) are automatically considered to  be in a domestic relationship in Victoria.\nTo achieve such changes in the law, LGBTIQ groups have kept constant pressure on \ngovernments (e.g. through demonstrations and lobbying parliamentarians). Mainstream media has been largely sympathetic, and media coverage  has increased awareness. By  2015, society \nwas generally more accepting of same-sex relationships. Those who were  more progressive \nkept pointing out that a  person\u2019s sexual orientation or  gender identity is  separate from parenting \nability. Those people believe that gender identity does not affect a  person\u2019s ability to be a  loving \nand caring parent. \nThe Victorian Parliament accepted the progressive view, and passed the Adoption Amendment \n(Adoption by  Same-Sex Couples) Act 2015 (Vic) to  allow LGBTIQ couples to  apply to  lawfully adopt \nchildren in Victoria.\nIn 2016 the Victorian Premier, Daniel Andrews, offered a  formal apology (in the parliament) to  \nLGBTIQ people who had been convicted (or found guilty) of  homosexuality, which was a  criminal \noffence under Victorian law prior to/uni00A01981.\nOn the other hand, for  some members of \nsociety the law is changing faster than they are comfortable with, moving ahead of social \nacceptance. These people may be strongly \nreligious or socially conservative (like the anti-abortion protesters discussed in Topic 14.3). If they feel they are  in a  minority, or are  strongly \ncriticised \nfor disagreeing, they may  just remain \nquiet. \nIn May  2017 the tennis champion Margaret \nCourt, who is a  church pastor, said she would \nrefuse to  fly Australia's national airline Qantas \nbecause it supported same-sex marriage. She was immediately placed under heavy pressure \nthrough the regular media and social media. CASE \nSTUDY\nSource 2 The rainbow flag has become a well-known symbol of \nthe/uni00A0fight for equality by LGBTIQ communities around the/uni00A0world.\nThe case study below highlights some of the law  reforms that have  been made to  ensure LGBTIQ \npeople are  treated equally before the law.\n14_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   476 10/10/2017   1:34 PM",
  "Page 489": "477  CHAPTER  14 LAW REFORM Changes in/uni00A0social, economic and political conditions\nLaw reform is a process that never ends. Our laws need to be continually reformed to make sure they \nremain relevant and keep up with changes that occur as a result of changing social, economic, and political circumstances. Each of these is discussed/uni00A0below.\nChanging social conditions\nAs Australia\u2019s population grows and changes, it is inevitable that some laws will need to change to ensure we can all live together peacefully and maintain our basic standard of living. Expected changes to our social structure over the next 35/uni00A0years include that our population will reach 40/uni00A0million by 2055 and that the average life expectancy of a baby born during that year will be to live to their mid-nineties. This has implications for law reform in many areas including health care, taxation, welfare payments (including the aged pensions) and the environment. An increasing population can lead to increased crime and the need for improved law enforcement infrastructure or agencies (including the police, courts and prisons) and more e\ufb00ective procedures within those agencies.\nSome examples of other social changes that have prompted law reform include:\n\u2022 increases in reported domestic violence\n\u2022 binge drinking\u2022 gang-related/uni00A0crime\u2022 online gambling\u2022 the obesity epidemic.\nChanging economic conditions\nAustralia\u2019s economy is continually changing. In particular, technology and \nglobalisation create issues that need to be addressed by the law. Governments need to monitor and change the laws that regulate the buying, selling and production of goods and services across di\ufb00erent areas of the economy such as banking and \ufb01nance, mining, manufacturing and agriculture.\nSometimes two or more largely unrelated trends interact to create a new \nissue that requires law reform. For example, changes in the workforce (e.g. an increase in part-time and casual employment) and in consumer trends (e.g. online shopping) necessitate changes in the law in both areas. In this case, that includes changing laws relating to industrial relations (i.e. wages and workplace conditions), consumer protection and banking (e.g. enforcement of guarantees and credit card laws) and international trading (e.g. the regulation of imports and exports). \nFor example, in 2016 the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of \nOrigin) Act 2017 (Cth) improved Australia\u2019s consumer laws. The Act simpli\ufb01ed \nthe test used to justify claims that products are \u2018made in\u2019 a particular country (e.g. labelled as \u2018Made in Australia\u2019).\nSimilarly, the Food Amendment (Kilojoule Labelling Scheme and Other Matters) \nAct/uni00A02016 (Vic)  changed the law to require fast food outlets to state the kilojoule \n(i.e. energy) content of each item on their menu at the point of sale. Supermarkets must also label pre-prepared \u2018ready to eat\u2019 and unpackaged food/uni00A0items.\nSource 3 As a result of law reforms \nintroduced in 2016, fast food outlets now \nneed to state the energy content (i.e. calories) of meals on their/uni00A0menus.\n14_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   477 10/10/2017   1:34 PM",

The  recent trend has been \nto make these laws  increasingly/uni00A0harsh as highlighted in the case study below.\nA person  \u2018of character  concern\u2019\nAustralia\u2019s Migration Act 1958 (Cth) has been amended many times to  reflect changing global \nand local political conditions. \nThe Minister for  Immigration can  cancel the visa of a  non-citizen for  people of bad \ncharacter. In 2004 the Act was  amended to  specifically define what is meant by a  person \u2018of \ncharacter concern\u2019 (in a  new  Section 5C). The minister\u2019s grounds for  judging a  person to  be \u2018of \nconcern\u2019 included having a  \u2018substantial criminal record\u2019 (having been sentenced to  two years  \nof imprisonment) or being at \u2018significant risk\u2019 of committing criminal acts, causing danger, stalking, vilifying, or causing discord. \nIn 2014 this section was  changed by  reducing the definition of \u2018a  substantial criminal record\u2019 \nto a sentence of imprisonment of 12/uni00A0months.\nIn 2017 the same section was  changed again. The words significant risk were  changed \nto just risk, and a  much wider range of behaviour was  defined as making someone a  person \n\u2018of concern\u2019. This included having been charged with a  serious offence (but not necessarily \nconvicted)./uni00A0 CASE \nSTUDY\nAdvances in/uni00A0technology\nTechnology is constantly improving and opening up possibilities that have  not previously been imagined. As it improves, our laws  \nneed to  be altered and updated. Some laws  will control and \nregulate new inventions and opportunities. Others will reduce the likelihood of people being harmed or exploited. For  example, the \nincreasing range and use of mobile devices and equipment (e.g. laptops, smart phones, smart watches and drones) have  created \nnew problems that the law  needs to  address. These include cyber-\nbullying, cyber-stalking, identity theft, online scams, invasion of  \nprivacy and noise pollution caused by  remotely piloted aircraft.\nTechnology also makes it easier to  pass on private information, \ncreating a need to  protect the privacy of \ufb01nancial and medical \nrecords. Law  reform has occurred at  both state  and Commonwealth \nlevels \u2013 for  example, in the Health Records Act  2001 (Vic) and the Privacy Act  1988/uni00A0(Cth).\nScienti\ufb01c and medical advancements also create the need for  law reform. For  example, the Human \nGenome Project, completed in 2003, dramatically increased genetic knowledge. Whole new areas of  \nresearch opened up,  but they created new areas of uncertainty in the law.  Who  owns our genes? Who  can \nshare our genetic information? Can genes be patented (a monopoly given to  an inventor)? \nGene patenting has a bearing on the detection and treatment of a vast range of illnesses and medical \nconditions and must be adequately regulated. Genetic testing companies must also be regulated to  ensure \nan individual\u2019s genetic information remains private and not sold to  third parties such as prospective Source 4 R ecent advances in drone technology, together with  \nthe widespread availability of drones, have created a host of  \nnew challenges for law-makers to  deal with.\n14_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   478 10/10/2017   1:34 PM",

The  \nPatents Act  1990 (Cth) is the main/uni00A0Act which governs the law  related to  patents.  An example of genetic \ntesting resulting in a need for  law reform is explored in the legal case below.\nGreater need for/uni00A0protection of/uni00A0the community\nLaw reform must continually occur to  make sure individuals and di\ufb00erent groups within \nour community are  protected and feel safe.  One of the major roles of the law  is to  \nprotect individuals from harm. \u2018Harm\u2019 can include physical harm (e.g. broken \nbones from violent assault), emotional harm (e.g. the destruction of self-esteem and depression that can come from bullying, sexual harassment or neglect) or economic harm or \ufb01nancial damage (e.g. exploitation through unfair workplace \nand trading practices). \nSome people within our community also have  speci\ufb01c needs and rights that  \nmust be protected, especially if they are  unable to  protect themselves (e.g. children,  \npowerless workers, consumers, people with disabilities and those who may  su\ufb00er  \ndiscrimination on the basis of their race, religion, gender or sexuality). Even animals  \nand the environment need protection. Laws  are therefore needed to  make unlawful  \nthose actions that may  harm individual members of the community, speci\ufb01c groups  \nwithin our community, and the community as a  whole. As new situations arise, new  \nlaws are required. For  example, in 2016 the Crimes Amendment (Carjacking and Home  \nInvasion) Act  2016 (Vic) introduced new carjacking and home invasion laws,  including  \nmore severe  penalties for  o\ufb00enders. These laws  were  to help protect the community  \nafter a  dramatic increase in those crimes.Source 6 Some people within our \ncommunity have specific needs and rights that must be protected, especially if they are unable to  protect themselves.\nOwnership of breast cancer gene/uni00A0codes\nD\u2019Arcy v Myriad Genetics Inc (2015) 325 ALR 100\nIn 2015, the High Court of Australia ruled in favour of Ms Yvonne D\u2019Arcy, a  69-year-old \ngrandmother and breast cancer survivor who had taken legal action against US  biotechnology \ncompany Myriad Genetics. Myriad claimed it could take  out a  patent to own  the \nBRCA1 gene mutation that increases a  woman\u2019s risk of  developing ovarian and \nbreast cancer.\nBy contrast, D\u2019Arcy argued that even  though the company had  \nundertaken research to  locate  and identify the BRCA1 mutation, it  could  \nnot own it, because the genetic material already existed in  nature. The  \ninformation it contained could only be discovered; it was  not a  newly  \ninvented way  of manufacturing a  product (to  get a  patent you  need  \nmore than a  discovery or an idea). In simple terms, the High Court  \nagreed with D\u2019Arcy and ruled that Myriad Genetics could not patent and  \nown the BRCA1/uni00A0gene.\nAllowing a  company to own  a gene could potentially limit the ability of  \nan individual to  use their genetic information without the company\u2019s  \npermission.LEGAL  \nCASE\nSource 5 Yvonne D\u2019Arcy took legal action against Myriad Genetics over  ownership of \nthe BRCA1 gene mutation.\n14_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   479 10/10/2017   1:34 PM",
  "Page 492": "480 UNIT 4  THE PEOPLE AND THE LAWGreater awareness of/uni00A0the need to/uni00A0protect/uni00A0rights\nOver the last 30/uni00A0years the law relating to equal opportunity has changed a number of times to protect \nindividuals from discrimination. The laws make it unlawful to discriminate a person on a range of grounds such as on the basis of age, gender, impairment, pregnancy or race. However, law reform in this area can be slow and controversial. For example, in 2016 the Victorian Government\u2019s attempt to change the Equal Opportunity Act 2010 (Vic) to remove the exemption that allows for religious organisations (e.g. schools) to discriminate against prospective employees on the grounds of their religious beliefs, sexual orientation or gender identity was defeated in the Victorian Parliament (in the Legislative Council).\nGreater need to/uni00A0provide improved access to/uni00A0the/uni00A0law\nAs people become better educated about the law and their rights, they are more likely to want to seek justice if they believe their rights have been infringed. To take a matter to court is expensive and can be intimidating. To assist people in their e\ufb00orts to seek a just resolution to disputes that arise, the law has been changed to provide more e\ufb00ective access to the law. For example, the Courts and Sentencing Legislation Amendment Act 2012 (Vic) created a Melbourne County Koori Court for the sentencing of Indigenous o\ufb00enders in speci\ufb01c circumstances to improve their access to more fair and culturally relevant justice. More recently, in 2016, a County Koori Court was established in Mildura.\nIn civil cases the courts have shown a continued commitment to address the problems of access to \njustice and delay. For example, in 2016 the Victorian Department of Justice and Regulation completed an Access to Justice Review. The report made 60 recommendations for change to improve access to justice for all Victorians including members of our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders community who need speci\ufb01c support and services to make sure they can engage with the criminal justice system and  receive a fair and just outcome. Possible reforms to improve access included:\n\u2022 developing a self-representation service to assist people who are not represented by lawyers\n\u2022 improving the availability of interpreters within the court system and at VCAT\n\u2022 developing an online system for the resolution of small civil claims.\nIn May 2017 the Victorian Government announced that it accepted a vast majority of the \nrecommendations and proposed funding to implement many of them.\nEncouraging changes in/uni00A0society values\nSometimes law-makers change the law to encourage a change in society\u2019s values. The Charter of Human \nRights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic) seeks to educate the community on rights and tolerance, generate respect for diversity, and promote understanding of the balance between rights and responsibilities. The Charter gives legislative protection for 21 separate human rights for Victorians, and sets out the responsibilities of governments, organisations and citizens in the general community.\nThe law-makers have also encouraged a change in values in relation to discrimination by passing the \nSentencing Amendment (Historical Homosexual Convictions Expungement) Act 2014/uni00A0 (Vic). This Act makes it \nunlawful to discriminate against a person on the grounds that they were once convicted under the old laws that banned homosexuality, with a penalty of up to 20/uni00A0years imprisonment. South Australia was the \ufb01rst state to decriminalise homosexual acts, and Victoria followed in/uni00A01980.\nOver recent years both Commonwealth and State governments have also tried to change values and \nattitudes towards domestic violence. They have introduced a range of laws to increase awareness of the \nharmful e\ufb00ects, and reduce the incidence, of domestic violence (e.g. violence within families).Legislative Council \nthe upper house of the Victorian Parliament\nKoori Court \na division of the Magistrates\u2019 Court, Children\u2019s Court and County Court that (in certain circumstances) operates as a sentencing court for Aboriginal people accused of committing crimes\ncriminal justice system \na set of processes and institutions used to investigate and determine criminal cases\nimprisonment \na sanction that involves the removal of the offender from society for a stated period of time and placing them in prison\ngovernment \nthe ruling authority with power to govern, formed by the political party that holds the majority in the lower house in each parliament.

A single individual with a grievance or an idea for reform would do better taking the problem to a member of parliament, or making a claim through a body such as a tribunal.\nlaw reform bodies \norganisations established by the state and Commonwealth parliaments to investigate the need for change in the law and make recommendations for reform\nsanction \na penalty (e.g. a fine or prison sentence) imposed by a court on a person found guilty of a criminal offence\nrepresentative \ngovernment a political system in which the people elect members of parliament to represent them in government\nLegislative Assembly \nthe lower house of the Victorian Parliamentpetition \na formal, written request to the government to take some action or implement law reform\n\u2192 GOING FURTHER\nIn addition to these means of influencing law reform, individuals can/uni00A0also:\n\u2022 make contact with their local member of parliament to express their concerns and show their \ndissatisfaction with the existing parliamentarians\n\u2022 join or form their own political party or lobby/protest/uni00A0group\u2022 make suggestions to formal law reform bodies during their investigative processes\u2022 risk receiving a sanction by defying or breaking the existing law to express their dissatisfaction.\nPetitions\nA petition is a formal, written request to the parliament for action in relation to a particular law that \nis in need of reform. It usually has a collection of signatures on it, which have been gathered from \nsupporters, but even a single individual can petition the parliament. \nThere is no minimum number of signatures. Once the organisers feel that a petition has a satisfactory \nnumber of signatures, they forward it to a local member of parliament to table (i.e. present) at the next sitting of parliament. This is the only way an individual or pressure group can directly put their concerns or complaints before the parliament.\nPetitions can be presented in two di\ufb00erent formats:\n\u2022 print petitions \u2013  traditional paper petitions collected in person and signed with physical signatures\n\u2022 digital petitions \u2013 e-petitions (or online petitions) collected online and signed using email addresses \nor digital signatures.\nA petition will appear more representative of the community if it is signed by as many people as \npossible, as this will show a high level of support for the suggested change in the law. This is important \nbecause members of parliament, in accordance with the principle of representative government, aim to make laws that re\ufb02ect the views and values of the majority of people rather than a few individuals.\nPaper petitions\nEvery page of a paper petition must contain the same information (what is being sought, and the circumstances), and the signatures must be original. Each house of parliament has di\ufb00erent requirements and procedures regarding the format and tabling of petitions.\nTraditionally, all Australian parliaments only accepted paper petitions. The Legislative Assembly of \nVictoria still accepts only paper petitions.\n14_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   482 10/10/2017   1:34 PM",
  "Page 495": "483  CHAPTER  14 LAW REFORM  E-petitions\nMore recently, e-petitions (often called digital petitions) have  become a popular way  for individuals to  \nraise awareness and express their desire for  change. The  Commonwealth Parliament and some state  \nparliaments have  introduced this reform and now  accept both paper and e-petitions. At a federal level, the \nHouse of Representatives started to  accept e-petitions in/uni00A02016.\nThe Senate makes no distinction between paper and digital petitions. However, if signatures have  \nbeen collected by  e-mail, problems with multiple forwarding and comments in emails can lead to  an \nincorrectly presented petition. The  Senate recommends placing the text of the petition on an internet \npage  and inviting people to  sign by  submitting their names and e-mail addresses.\nIn Victoria in November 2016, a committee of the Legislative Council proposed to  introduce e-petitions. \nA/uni00A0new Standing Order 10.10 came into e\ufb00ect after a pilot system was  run on the Legislative Council page  \nof the Parliament of Victoria website. Petitions may  only be presented to  the Council by  a member of  \nthe Legislative Council. Like petitions to  the Commonwealth Parliament, any  number of people may/uni00A0sign. \nMembers of the public can view a list of current petitions and add  their signatures. This may  help \ne-petitions gain larger numbers of signatures than paper petitions.\nThe case study below is an example of a petition that was  forwarded to  Nina Springle MLC  to be \npresented to  the Legislative Council of Victoria.House of \nRepresentatives the lower  house of \nthe Commonwealth Parliament\nSenate \nthe upper house of the Commonwealth Parliament\nPetition  to ban plastic/uni00A0bags\nIn August 2016, a group of environmental \ncampaigners called Plastic Bag Free  Victoria \npresented a  petition with over  11 000 signatures \nto Greens Member of the Legislative Council, \nNina Springle. The campaigners demanded the law be changed to  ban single-use plastic \nshopping bags, which increase landfill, pollute oceans and threaten sea life and birds. Queensland and Western Australia have introduced laws which will ban single-use plastic bags from 2018 and it is hoped other states  will follow.CASE \nSTUDY\nSource 1 Over the years, numerous petitions \nhave called for a ban on single-use plastic bags because they are very harmful to  marine \nanimals around the/uni00A0world such as sea turtles.\nA famous petition to  \nthe Commonwealth Parliament was presented on paper surrounded by bark paintings. It was submitted on behalf of the Yolgnu people of Yirrkala, NT. Their traditional land was under threat from mining. The parliament responded by setting up a select committee to  \ninvestigate./uni00A0/uni00A0 Did you know?\nPetitions may  be in relation to  an issue of general interest (e.g. to  prevent logging of certain forests or \neuthanasia in limited circumstances) or an issue relevant to  a small group of people (e.g. the need for  a \nsupervised school crossing in a local area). Each year the parliament may  also be presented with a number \nof petitions on the same subject.\nRegardless of its type, the form  and content of a petition must follow the rules set out by  the parliament \nto which it is being presented. For  example, a petition presented in the Victorian Parliament must, among \nother requirements:\n\u2022 be addressed to  only one house of parliament\n\u2022 refer to  a matter that is within the power of the parliament to  address\n\u2022 contain a brief paragraph stating the reasons for  the petition\n\u2022 contain a request for  parliament to  take/uni00A0action\n\u2022 be legible and not contain any  o\ufb00ensive or disrespectful language\n\u2022 be presented or tabled in parliament by  a member of parliament (although this can be any  member. \nThat  is, it does not have  to be the petitioner\u2019s local member).\n14_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   483 10/10/2017   1:35 PM",

For  many Australians, and particularly many Indigenous Australians, holding \na celebration of Australia on this date is considered inappropriate and even  offensive, \nbecause it commemorates a  day of sorrow \nwhen Aboriginal Australians lost their \nindependence and sovereign right to  control \ntheir land, culture and families. Australia Day  \nis therefore often referred to as  \u2018Invasion/uni00A0Day\u2019.\nEach year demonstrations take  place to  \nraise community awareness of the suffering \nof Indigenous Australians since colonisation, and to  increase support for  changing the \ncelebration of  Australia to a  more appropriate \nand inclusive date. The demonstrations also seek to  influence law reform in relation to  \nIndigenous Australians, such as creating a  \ntreaty which governs the relationship with Indigenous Australians.CASE \nSTUDY\nSource 1 Whil e most Australians celebrate Australia Day on 26 January  \neach year, more and more people are now beginning to  call it \u2018Invasion  \nDay\u2019 because it commemorates the arrival of European settlers and the  \nloss of rights and freedoms for Indigenous Australians. In 2017, tens  \nof thousands of people gathered in Melbourne's CBD for an 'Invasion  \nDay'/uni00A0rally.\nOne of the common ways  individuals in our community can in\ufb02uence a change in the law  is by  organising \nor participating in a public demonstration.\nDemonstrations are  most e\ufb00ective when large numbers of people rally in support. This means they rely  \non being supported by  a large amount of interested individuals or a  focused pressure (or protest group).\nDemonstrations\nDemonstrations (also referred to  as protests or rallies) occur when a group of people gather together \nto express their common concern or dissatisfaction with an existing law.  It can be an e\ufb00ective way  for \nindividuals and pressure groups to  in\ufb02uence law  reform by  alerting the government to  the need for  a \nchange in the law.  They  can also raise awareness of the need for  legislative change within the community, \nwhich generates further support for  the change. To  be e\ufb00ective, however, demonstrations need to  attract \nlarge numbers of people and positive media coverage,  as members of parliament are  more likely to  \nimplement law  reform that has signi\ufb01cant support. They  are also more likely to  associate themselves with \npositive campaigns that may  increase their popularity with voters, rather than ones that cause con\ufb02ict, \npublic inconvenience or violence.\nDemonstrations can take  di\ufb00erent forms, but they all aim to  bring an issue to  the attention of the \ncommunity and the law-makers with the objective of in\ufb02uencing a change in the/uni00A0law.\nOne example includes the growing number of people who demonstrate on 26 January, the day  \ncelebrated as Australia Day.demonstration \na gathering of a group of people to  protest \nor express their common concern or dissatisfaction with an existing law as a means of influencing law reform\npressure group \na group of people who have a common interest in trying to  influence \nchanges in the law\n14_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   486 10/10/2017   1:35 PM",

This was to  express their dissatisfaction \nwith proposed government changes to  the taxi  industry, including legalising the Uber ride \nsharing service. After crossing the bridge the drivers, who believed the proposed changes \nwould unfairly destroy their businesses and livelihoods, progressed to  Parliament House, \nwhere they were joined by about 200 other protesters.\nOne concern of the taxi  drivers was  that the government\u2019s deregulation of the industry \nincluded abolishing the existing \u2018taxi  licencing scheme\u2019. This required taxi  drivers to  obtain a  \nlicence to  operate the business. \nWhile the demonstration achieved the aim of  generating community awareness and support \nfor the taxi  drivers\u2019 concerns, and gained significant media coverage  (particularly on local \nand national morning television and radio programs), it did cause inconvenience to  morning \ncommuters, who were stuck in traffic jams.

A common way  individuals can \ntry and raise awareness of the need for  law reform is by  challenging the law  in the courts.\nThe use of/uni00A0the/uni00A0courts\nIndividuals can be instrumental in bringing about a change in the law  by taking a matter to  court. In taking \nthe case to  court, they will usually be trying to  prove  their own  claim rather than trying to  change the law,  \nbut if an unclear point of  law is clari\ufb01ed or established in the process, then their case has played a/uni00A0part. \nIf the parliament has passed a law  that is unclear or unfair, the legislation can be challenged through \nthe court system in the hope that a judge will interpret and clarify the meaning of the law  in their favour. \nHowever, with the exception of  High Court rulings in constitutional disputes, parliament can always  pass \nlegislation to  override a court decision.\nThe role of the courts in in\ufb02uencing a change in the law  can also be limited in other ways.  First, they \ncan only in\ufb02uence change if a case comes before them. Second, they can only rule on the issues directly \ninvolved in that/uni00A0case. \nFinally, the courts can only decide a point of  law or case when people are  prepared to  challenge \nexisting law  in the courts. People can be deterred or put o\ufb00 taking a case to  court by  the high costs \ninvolved (e.g. the cost of engaging legal representatives), the amount of time the case may  take  and the \nuncertainty of the outcome. They  must also have  standing to  be able to  initiate a court action.\nThe case of  NSW  Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages v Norrie (2014) 250 CLR 490 is an example \nof an individual trying to  in\ufb02uence change by  challenging a law  in the courts.High Court \nthe ultimate court of appeal in Australia and the court with the authority to  hear and \ndetermine disputes arising under the Australian Constitution\nGender recognition\nNSW Registrar of  Births, Deaths and \nMarriages v Norrie (2014) 250 CLR/uni00A0490\nNorrie, an individual who does not identify as being \neither male or female, undertook court action against the decision of the New  South Wales Registry of Births, \nDeaths and Marriages to  not allow Norrie to  register as \nbeing of \u2018non-specific\u2019 sex. The Registry claimed that in accordance with the Births, Deaths and Marriages \nRegistration Act/uni00A0 1995/uni00A0 (NSW)/uni00A0 they only had the power to  \nchange a person\u2019s sex from male to  female or vice/uni00A0versa.\nThe case was  ultimately resolved by the High Court in \nNSW Registrar of  Births, Deaths and Marriages v  Norrie, \nwhich ruled that the Registry did have the power to  record  \nNorrie\u2019s sex in a gender-neutral/uni00A0way.\nFollowing this case, the Victorian Government introduced the Births, Deaths and Marriages \nRegistration Amendment Bill 2016 (Vic) in an  attempt to  change the law to  allow people who do  \nnot identify as  being either male or  female, to  change their sex  on their birth certificate without \nhaving to  undergo medical surgery to  affirm their sex and be unmarried.LEGAL  \nCASE\nSource 1 Norrie, who does not \nidentify as either male or female, tested  the law in/uni00A0court.\n14_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   489 10/10/2017   1:35 PM",

The \ncase arose after the Victorian Government transferred a  group of  teenage offenders to  Barwon \nPrison, a  maximum-security prison for  adults, following a  series of  riots that damaged sections \nof the Parkville Youth Detention Precinct. The government claimed it was  forced  to temporarily \nhouse some young offenders at Barwon Prison, in a  section separate from adult offenders, \nwhile it was repairing the centre because all other youth facilities were/uni00A0full.\nBy contrast, lawyers from the Human Rights Law Centre (HRLC), who acted on behalf of a  \ngroup of youths being held at the prison, claimed the government\u2019s policy was  a gross breach \nof human rights and would cause physical and mental harm to  the young offenders. During the \ntrial the court heard allegations that, in  addition to  being locked in  their cells for up to 23  hours \na day, some youths had been subject to  capsicum spray. \nIn 2016 the Supreme Court found in  favour of  the youths, declaring the detainment of  children \nin an adult prison unlawful (in Certain Children by  their Litigation Guardian Sister Marie Brigid \nArthur v  Minister for  Families and Children [2016] VSC 796 (21 December 2016)).

  "Page 504": "492 UNIT 4  THE PEOPLE AND THE LAWTHE ROLE OF THE MEDIA IN LAW/uni00A0REFORM 14.5 \nThe media, both traditional media (newspapers, television and radio) and social media, have an \nimportant role to play in in\ufb02uencing changes in the law. Social media includes communicating information using a huge range of internet tools, applications and platforms, and over recent years the use of platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, LinkedIn) and bookmarking sites (Pinterest, Reddit, Delicious, Digg) have gained signi\ufb01cant popularity. The sharing they allow through web pages, blogs, videos and images was unimaginable 25/uni00A0years ago. Information, comments, views and opinions can now be communicated by any individual or group to potentially millions of people almost instantaneously and with limited restrictions or censorship. This makes social media an important way for individuals and pressure groups to gain awareness of an issue and support for law reform. Members of parliament, political parties, pressure groups and individuals can all take advantage/uni00A0of/uni00A0it.\nHow social media and traditional media can \ninfluence law/uni00A0reform\nIndividuals and groups can use both traditional and social media to help generate community interest \nin, awareness of and support for a desired law change. This is important, as law reform campaigns that attract maximum community interest and support are the most likely to attract the attention of members of parliament who are in a position to directly in\ufb02uence a change in the/uni00A0law.\nSocial/uni00A0media\nSocial media has the ability to create interest in, and raise awareness of, legal issues on a massive scale. People are able to share their views and opinions with the entire community by using a vast range of social media platforms, sites and blogs (like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and Reddit). Through the use of social media platforms, individuals, speci\ufb01c interest or pressure groups, parliamentarians and even traditional media organisations (like television broadcasters, radio programs and newspapers) now have the ability to communicate their opinions to a broader audience and with greater speed than at any time in history. For example, during 2016, Facebook averaged approximately 15/uni00A0million users per month. Similarly, Y ouTube was accessed approximately 14.5/uni00A0million times per month. In June 2017, Facebook announced that it had reached 2 billion monthly active users worldwide.\nImages, videos and live streaming of events can be used to generate great interest in and awareness \nof legal and political issues and the need for law reform. The increasing use of mobile devices (such as smart phones, smart watches and tablets) allows most people to have the ability to capture and broadcast footage. Demonstrations and events can be captured on video or streamed live to help gain support for law reform. For example, footage of crime, cruelty to live export animals and conditions in detention centres for asylum seekers have all been placed on social media to gain support for law reform in these/uni00A0areas.\nThe case study on the next page is an example of media being used to gain support for asylum seeker \nlaw reforms.social media \na range of digital tools, applications and websites used to share information in real time between large groups of people (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat)\nIn July 2016, the fatal shooting of a 32-year-old African-American man Philando Castile by a policeman in the United States of America was live streamed online. The policeman mistakenly thought Mr Castile was reaching for a handgun rather than his wallet. The streaming caused great controversy. It inspired demonstrations that highlighted alleged discrimination within the American criminal justice system, as well as public protests which emphasised the need for greater respect of law enforcement officers.Did you know?\n14_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   492 10/10/2017   1:35 PM",
  "Page 505": "493  CHAPTER  14 LAW REFORM  \u2018Chasing  Asylum\u2019\nIn 2016, Australian film maker, Eva  Orner, produced a  film called \u2018Chasing Asylum\u2019 to  show \nand raise awareness of  the sad and distressing plight of  people who have been forced  to leave  \ntheir home countries (due to war  and fear of  their lives) and were  seeking asylum in  Australia. \nThe film follows the story of a  group of  asylum seekers and shows some of  the difficulties they \nface while away  from family and friends. It also contains footage, secretly filmed, of the poor \nconditions in the Australian detention centres at Nauru and Manus Island.\nThe film was  marketed as \u2018The film the Australian Government doesn\u2019t want you  to see\u2019. \nIt was  made by Ms Orner to  raise community awareness of treatment of asylum seekers and \nplace pressure on  the Australian Government to  change the laws relating to  the detainment and \ntreatment of asylum seekers in Australia.\nWhile the film was  released in cinemas, it generated \ngreat interest in the traditional and social media. Clips \nwere  circulated on social media platforms like YouTube \nand Facebook. It was  also discussed on television and radio \nprograms, including the ABC\u2019s Q&A and Radio National \nprograms and Network 10\u2019s The Project, and in a  range of \nnewspaper and media sites. A/uni00A0 Facebook page, Twitter account and website (www.chasingasylum.com.au) were  also \ncreated. People are  encouraged on those sites to  undertake \nother action to  influence a  change in asylum seeker laws, \nsuch as by signing an online petition, writing to  their local \nmember of parliament, donating to  a local refugee camp or \nvolunteering with a local refugee/uni00A0group.CASE \nSTUDY\nSource 1 \u2018Chasing Asylum\u2019 is a film and law reform \ncampaign. It was designed to  increase community \nawareness and support for law reform so that people seeking asylum in Australia are always  treated with \ndignity and humanity.\nSocial media also connects people around the world and can be used to  inform a global audience, \nincluding national and state  governments, about a range of legal issues and perceived injustices. This \ninformation can provoke and inspire people to  undertake action on global issues by  in\ufb02uencing law  \nreform at  a local level. For  example, many environmental groups within Australia, such as the Australian \nConservation Foundation, the Green Energy Council and the Y outh Climate Change Coalition, use social \nmedia to  gain support for  law reform in a range of areas including reducing global warming and achieving \nsustainable global food production.\nSocial media is also in\ufb02uential in law  reform because users \ncan directly access a political party, politician or local member of  \nparliament via their website, Facebook page  and Twitter or Instagram \naccount to  gain an insight into their views and opinions on various \nlegal issues and receive up-to-date information. In this way,  the public \ncan more directly interact with members of parliament and make them more accountable for  their actions.\nSimilarly, social media is becoming a signi\ufb01cant source for \nbreaking news, announcements and discussions on a wide range of political, social, environmental and commercial topics. Most politicians at  federal and state  levels use social media platforms such \nas Facebook and Twitter, including the prime minister and the leader of the opposition. Social media can achieve outstanding outcomes \nfor mass communication, which can lead to  changes in the/uni00A0law.\nSource 2 Members of the Youth Climate Change Coalition \ndemonstrating for law reform to  address the global \nclimate crisis.\n14_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   493 10/10/2017   1:35 PM",

The \nprogram showed disturbing footage, including that of one young offender being forcibly strip-\nsearched by detention centre/uni00A0staff.\nWithin a  week of the program being broadcast, a  police taskforce was  set up to  review all \nreports of incidents involving young offenders that had occurred over  the previous decade at \ntwo specific detention centres in the Northern Territory \n(i.e. the Don Dale and Alice Springs Detention Centres).\nThe federal government also announced a Royal  \nCommission into the Protection and Detention of  Youth in  \nthe Northern Territory to  examine the treatment of youth \nin these facilities.

These were  the main means by  \nwhich people obtained news and information before the twenty-\ufb01rst century. In Australia, while there has \nbeen a rapid growth in social media over  the last decade, approximately 52 per cent of Australians still rely  \non traditional media, with another 21 per cent gaining their news online through the apps  and websites of  \nthese traditional media mediums rather than via social/uni00A0media.\nTraditional media has an important role in in\ufb02uencing law  reform through its ability to  examine, discuss \nand inform people about legal issues and possible changes to  the law.  Newspapers, television and radio \nare still a major source of news within our community, being accessed by  millions of readers, viewers and \nlisteners each week, and have  the ability to  shape the views and attitudes of their audience depending \non the manner in which they present a legal or political issue or argument. Television programs such as Sunrise, Today, The Project, Lateline, 7.30, Foreign Correspondent, Q&A, and A Current A\ufb00air often contain \nsegments about the need for  law reform and possible changes to  the law.  They  also provide a forum for  \npolitical parties and parliamentarians to  outline their policy stance on law  reform, explain their actions \nand be held accountable for  their views on law  reform.\nMany television programs also investigate problems in our community to  inform the public of  \ninjustices and the need for  changes in the  law.

Television and radio producers and newspaper editors can manipulate content in an attempt to  \nalter the community\u2019s perception of and discredit a particular individual or pressure group if the owners \nof their media organisation do not support their views. For  example, producers can edit footage  of a \nlargely peaceful demonstration and choose to  broadcast one brief moment of con\ufb02ict between a few  \nprotesters and police in an attempt to  alter the viewer\u2019s perceptions. Likewise, more broadcasting time \ncan be given during radio and television interviews to  individuals, pressure groups and parliamentarians \nwho support the views held by  the owners of the media organisation on which they are  appearing.\nThe high concentration of ownership in the traditional media may  also decrease its independence and \ngive the owners of media organisations excessive power and too  much  ability to  in\ufb02uence community \nviews on controversial legal issues, law  reform and even  the way  people vote  in elections.

In situations like this, parliaments may prefer to pass the investigation of the need for law reform to an independent law reform body that can conduct its own investigations and make recommendations for changes to the/uni00A0law.\nFormal law reform bodies are organisations established by the state and Commonwealth Governments \nto inform them of changes in society that may require a change in the law. They aim to give impartial advice and make recommendations that are practical and able to be implemented. Parliament is not bound to follow the recommendations from formal law reform bodies, although the government is often in\ufb02uenced by the reports of these committees when considering changes in the/uni00A0law.\nThe Victorian Law Reform Commission (VLRC) is Victoria\u2019s leading independent law reform \norganisation, which reviews, researches and makes recommendations to the Parliament of Victoria about possible changes to Victoria\u2019s/uni00A0laws.\nThe role of/uni00A0the/uni00A0VLRC\nThe Victorian Parliament established the VLRC in 2001 by passing the Victorian Law Reform Commission Act 2000 (Vic). The VLRC was \ntherefore created by statute, and obtains its powers and functions \nthrough that statute.\nThe VLRC aims to assist the Victorian Government in \ncontinuing to provide a fair, inclusive and accessible legal system by investigating the need for change in Victorian laws and providing the government impartial advice and recommendations for change.\nWhile the VLRC was created and is funded by the Victorian \nGovernment, it is an independent organisation that is not involved in the political process or in\ufb02uenced by the policies of the government or political parties.\nIn general terms, the VLRC monitors and coordinates law \nreform activity in Victoria and investigates and advises the Victorian Government on ways to update and improve Victorian law. When conducting its investigations, the VLRC engages in community-wide consultation and debate to ensure its recommendations for changes to the law meet the needs and desires of the Victorian community. For example, the VLRC will respond to issues and concerns raised by individuals and pressure groups, and consider newly emerging rights and responsibilities.\nSection 5 of the Victorian Law Reform Commission Act sets out the speci\ufb01c roles of the/uni00A0VLRC:\n\u2022 inquiry \u2013 To examine and report on any proposal or matter referred to it by the Victorian Attorney-General and make recommendations to the Attorney-General for law reform.

For example, a review in 2001 on bail resulted in changes to the Bail Act 1977 (Vic).The VLRC is limited by its resources, and therefore can only undertake investigations into minor legal issues if it does not require a significant deployment of those resources.\nThe VLRC is independent of parliament, thus ensuring it remains objective and unbiased in making its recommendations.The VLRC is constrained by the references with which it is provided by the Attorney-General on major issues of law reform (i.e. it will generally be limited by those references, even if the VLRC considers there are other areas of reform required in that particular matter).\nStatistics suggest that the VLRC can be highly influential on the Victorian Parliament. All or some of its recommendations are adopted in approximately 70 per cent of cases.The ability of/uni00A0the VLRC to/uni00A0influence law/uni00A0reform\nThe VLRC has an important role in reviewing Victorian law.

  "Page 518": "506 UNIT 4  THE PEOPLE AND THE LAWPARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES 14.7 \nAs we have learnt, Australia\u2019s parliamentary system is based on various principles, and works in a way to \nensure our federal and state parliaments can e\ufb00ectively perform their main role \u2013 i.e. to make and change the/uni00A0law.\nFor example, our parliamentary system is based on the principle of representative government, \nwhich ensures that our members of parliaments make laws on behalf of the voters and which re\ufb02ect the prevailing views and values of the majority of society (or they risk not being re-elected).\nLikewise, having a bicameral system of parliament ensures that any proposed changes to the law (i.e. \nbills) are thoroughly discussed and debated by both houses of parliament before becoming/uni00A0law.\nAnother important feature of the Australian parliamentary system is that it includes a committee \nsystem, meaning the federal and state parliaments have an extensive range of committees that can investigate a wide range of legal, social and political issues and concerns and report back to the parliament about the need for law reform.\nThe committee/uni00A0system\nA parliamentary committee is a speci\ufb01c \ngroup of government and non-government members of parliament who are given the responsibility of investigating a speci\ufb01c issue, policy or proposed law (bill) and reporting their \ufb01ndings and recommendations for law reform back to the entire parliament. They are often established so an issue of state, national or community interest can be examined more e\ufb03ciently (i.e. more quickly, more economically and in greater detail) than it could be if all members of parliament were involved in the investigation.\nThe committee system is an important \nfeature of our parliamentary system because it allows members of parliament to examine and evaluate the need for law reform. It also provides a way for members of the community \nto give input into the issues being investigated and have their views considered in the parliamentary decision-making process. Unlike law reform bodies, the committee is made up of members of parliament.\nWhen a parliamentary committee investigates a speci\ufb01c issue or matter, one of its main roles is to \nconsult with and consider the views of the community, including interested individuals and experts, pressure groups, business groups and organisations and government departments.\nAnother bene\ufb01t of parliamentary committees is their \ufb01nal reports enable the parliament to be more \ninformed before making important decisions like determining whether to support a bill. Parliamentary committees can also be established to provide a check on the government\u2019s activities because they have the power to call individuals, experts and people who work in government departments to give evidence and answer questions in relation to the speci\ufb01c area under investigation.\nSource 1 In 2017, the Victorian Government rejected a \nrecommendation made by a parliamentary committee to lower the driving age from 18 to 17/uni00A0years, in line with all other states and territories in Australia.The VCE Legal Studies Study Design requires you to know either one parliamentary committee, or one royal commission, and one recent example of either one or the other.

  "Page 519": "507  CHAPTER  14 LAW REFORM There are many di\ufb00erent types of parliamentary committees throughout the federal and state \nparliaments. For example, committees can consist of members from both houses of parliament or just \none house, and may be an ongoing committee, or a temporary one to investigate one speci\ufb01c issue. \nCommittees may also vary in size, though Victorian parliamentary committees usually consist of six to ten members of parliament plus a number of parliamentary employees, called a secretariat, who provide \nadministrative support and help run hearings. At federal level, committees generally range from seven to 32 members and, like at state level, is considered one of the duties of an elected member of parliament.\nProcesses used by/uni00A0parliamentary committees\nWhile there are di\ufb00erent types of parliamentary committees, with each performing speci\ufb01c tasks and functions, most committees have similar processes and procedures. In general, parliamentary committees follow the following processes:\n\u2022 Fir st, when parliament decides to have a committee investigate a particular issue or matter, the \ncommittee will be given terms of reference which specify the precise purpose of the inquiry, the \nspeci\ufb01c issues that must be investigated and the date by which the \ufb01nal report must be completed.\n\u2022 Once the terms of reference are established the committee often uses the media to publicise their investigations and seek input, via written submissions, from interested individuals, experts, groups and organisations within the community. This includes advertising in the traditional media like newspapers, and using the internet and social/uni00A0media.\n\u2022 Committ ees will also usually hold formal public (or on occasion private) hearings. The committee \nwill invite a range of people (e.g. experts in the matter under review and representatives from di\ufb00erent interested groups) to provide their input and give evidence relating to the matter under investigation and answer speci\ufb01c questions from committee members. Most committees have the power to call or require certain individuals and experts, like people who work in government departments, to give evidence, answer speci\ufb01c questions and explain their actions. If a person who is called to give evidence to a committee refuses to attend or answer speci\ufb01c questions, he or she can receive a formal reprimand or be prosecuted and receive a \ufb01ne or term of imprisonment.\n\u2022 Once all of the submissions have been received and considered and hearings have concluded the committee will prepare a written report. The report will contain recommendations for law reform or actions and will be presented to the parliament for consideration. Generally all written submissions and hearings are published in Hansard and made public on the parliament\u2019s website.\nSpecific committees and recent examples\nThe four main types of parliamentary committees in both the Victorian and Commonwealth parliaments/uni00A0are:\n\u2022 standing committees\n\u2022 select committees\u2022 joint investigatory committees\u2022 domestic committees.\nStanding committees\nStanding committees are parliamentary committees that are appointed for the life of a parliament (and \nthen usually re-established in successive parliaments) to investigate a range of speci\ufb01c issues and provide an ongoing check on government activities. They are ongoing, not temporary, committees. For example, the Victorian Standing Committee on Legal and Social Issues is an ongoing Victorian parliamentary committee that inquires into and reports on any proposal or matter concerned with community services, education, gaming, health, and law and justice.evidence \ninformation used to support the facts in a legal case\n\ufb01ne \na sanction that requires the offender to pay an amount of money to the state\nHansard \nthe official transcript (i.e. written record) of what is said in parliament.

The Bill was introduced into the Legislative Council as a private members\u2019 bill by the leader of the Australian Sex Party (to be renamed the Reason Party), Fiona Patten. The Bill proposed to change the law to allow a medically supervised drug injecting centre to be opened in Richmond, an inner-city suburb of Melbourne, on a trial basis for 18/uni00A0months. The controversial proposal would provide a safe injecting room for heroin addicts in an attempt to control drug use and save lives.\nAny proposal to allow medically supervised drug injecting centres inevitably causes great \ndebate within our community as opponents of such centres often claim there is no such thing as a \u2018safe injecting room\u2019, and is simply assisting in perpetuating or propping up an evil drug industry. However, there is evidence to suggest that safe injecting rooms can reduce the spread of diseases like hepatitis and HIV and can promote safe disposal of used needles, decrease deaths from drug overdoses and encourage and increase the amount of people who seek and attend drug rehabilitation treatment facilities and other health services.\nThe Committee investigated \nspecific areas of the Bill to ensure it did not unduly trespass on rights and freedoms, and was compatible with the human rights set out in the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities. For example, the Committee investigated whether the provision that children be excluded from the part of the injection centre where drugs would be administered or dispensed was compatible with the right of children to protection that is in his or her best interests.\nSource 3 The first medically supervised injecting room in Australia was set up on a \ntrial basis in Sydney\u2019s Kings Cross in/uni00A02001.\n14_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   510 10/10/2017   1:35 PM",

They also play a vital role in ensuring that bills do not breach or impose on our basic rights and freedoms and making sure the government is provided with independent advice and recommendations for law change. \nOne problem however, is that, like the VLRC, parliamentary committees only have the power to \ninvestigate issues within their speci\ufb01c terms of reference and the government and parliament are under no compulsion to adopt their advice or \ufb01nal recommendations. Likewise, parliamentary committees can be costly and time-consuming although, unlike the VLRC, they have the power to request that speci\ufb01c individuals and representatives of organisations appear at hearings to give evidence and answer questions, which enables them to gain extensive and valuable information for their consideration.\nThe ability of parliamentary committees to in\ufb02uence law reform is summarised in Source/uni00A06.\nSTRENGTHS OF PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEESWEAKNESSES OF PARLIAMENTARY \nCOMMITTEES\nCommittees can investigate a wide range of \nlegal, social and political issues and concerns and report back to the parliament about the need for law reform.Due to limited resources a committee cannot be formed to examine all worthy issues and concerns.\nCommittees can examine issues more efficiently (i.e. more quickly, more economically and in greater detail) than having the entire parliament involved in the investigation.Committee investigations can be time-consuming and costly.\nCommittees allow members of parliament to be involved in investigations and gain knowledge, expertise and understanding in the area of suggested law reform.The large number of committees and the time commitment involved may deter some members of parliament from sitting on committees.\nCommittees provide a way for members of the community to give input into the issues being investigated and have their views considered in the parliamentary decision-making process.Members of the governing party may dominate the composition and findings of a committee or use them as a distraction or way of avoiding other controversial legislation or parliamentary issues.\nThe final reports prepared by committees enable the parliament to be more informed before deciding whether or not to support a bill.There is no obligation on parliament to support or introduce law reforms suggested by a committee, although this may be more likely given that committees consist of members of parliament.\nSource 6 The strengths and weaknesses of parliamentary committees in influencing law reform\n14_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   512 10/10/2017   1:35 PM",

They are one of the oldest forms of inquiry. The inquiry is given \u2018terms of reference\u2019 (a description of what it is asked to inquire into) and asked to report on its \ufb01ndings and make recommendations. \nRoyal commissions are given special \ninvestigatory powers, including the power to summon (i.e. compel) people to attend \nhearings, give evidence under oath, and be subject to cross-examination.\nEstablishment of/uni00A0royal commissions\nRoyal commissions can be established at both the state and Commonwealth/uni00A0level.\nThe power to establish a royal commission is provided by statute. At the Commonwealth level, the \npower to issue a royal commission is given to the Governor-General through the Royal Commissions Act 1902 (Cth). At the Victorian level, the power to establish a royal commission is given to the governor \nunder the Inquiries Act 2014/uni00A0(Vic).\nRoyal commissions are therefore set up by the executive branch of government (i.e. the Governor-\nGeneral [at federal level] or the Governor [at state level] on behalf of the Queen). However, the Queen\u2019s representative acts on the advice of the government ministers. Therefore, in reality, it is the government that initiates a royal commission in response to a major issue of public interest or concern.\nFor example, in 2013 the then Governor-General, Her Excellency Quentin Bryce, established the \nCommonwealth Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse on the advice of the Federal Government to investigate sexual abuse of children within Australian institutions including schools, childcare, religious and sporting organisations.\nIn addition to advising the Governor-General or governor on the establishment of a royal commission, \nthe government also provides funding for royal commissions and determines their terms of reference and/uni00A0length.\nIssuing a royal commission\nAs a royal commission is a temporary form of inquiry, and can be expensive, they are established on an ad-hoc basis and look into matters of signi\ufb01cant importance, and often matters surrounded by controversy.\nThe Queen\u2019s representative must \ufb01rst issue a letters patent. The letters patent will specify the person \nor persons who are appointed to constitute the royal commission, as well as which of those persons (if Source 1 A snapshot of a hearing held for the Royal \nCommission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. royal commission the highest form of inquiry into matters of public concern and importance.

The letters patent must also specify a time by \nwhich the royal commission is to report on its inquiry and the terms of reference.\nThe chairperson of the royal commission will then engage people to assist the royal commission.\nProcesses used by/uni00A0royal commissions\nOnce a royal commission has been established and the letters patent has been issued, the commission conducts an extensive investigation of the matter of public interest or concern by undertaking a range of tasks. For example, the commission/uni00A0may:\n\u2022 pr epare an issues paper. This paper outlines the matter or concern being investigated by the royal \ncommission, poses questions relating to possible reforms that could be implemented to address the \nareas of concern and seeks and provides guidance for individuals and organisations that wish to make a written submission. For example, the Victorian Royal Commission into Family Violence prepared an issues paper to explain the concerns being examined by the royal commission. It encouraged any individual or organisation a\ufb00ected by family violence or has ideas that might assist the work of the royal commission (e.g. health professionals, childcare and social welfare workers, law enforcement agencies and educational institutions like schools and universities and di\ufb00erent religious and community groups) to make a written submission\n\u2022 conduct consultation sessions to gain input, views and opinions from a range of individuals and \norganisations that have an interest in the area being investigated. For example, the Victorian Royal Commission into Family Violence held 44 group consultation sessions attended by over 850 people. These included victims, perpetrators, prisoners, community and religious leaders, and representatives of disadvantaged groups such as Indigenous Australian women and children, women with disabilities and people from the LGBTI community\n\u2022 hold public hearings or sit in private to gain evidence relevant to the terms of reference. Royal commissions have extensive powers, to seize and gain evidence at their hearings. For example, they can summons or compel people to attend, give evidence under oath or a\ufb03rmation and be subject to cross-examination. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse held a number of formal public hearings to examine evidence about how di\ufb00erent institutions (like the Catholic Church, Scouts Australia, the YMCA, and the Salvation Army) responded to allegations of speci\ufb01c cases of child sex abuse within their organisations.\nOnce an investigation is complete and evidence and submissions have been considered, the royal \ncommission will prepare a report on their \ufb01ndings and make recommendations on ways to address \nthe matter under investigation. This might include recommendation for changes in government policy, administrative systems and changes in the law and legal system. The royal commission also has the power to recommend that an individual be prosecuted for unlawful conduct, although the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) is not required to act on these recommendations. The DPP may not do so in cases where, for example, an individual has been forced to give self-incriminating evidence in a manner that would not be admissible in a traditional/uni00A0court.\nExamples of royal commissions\nOver the years, there have been more than 130 royal commissions at the Commonwealth level on a range of issues of signi\ufb01cant public interest or concern. Not including more recent Commonwealth royal commissions, these include the following:\n\u2022 Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (1987\u201391)\u2022 Building and Construction Industry (2001\u201303)Australia\u2019s first ever \nroyal commission was held in 1902, just one year after the Federation of Australia. It was held in response to a public outcry after 17 Australian soldiers died returning home from the Boer War in South Africa and its purpose was to investigate transport arrangements.\nBy 2017 there had \nbeen a total of 133 royal commissions in Australia on a range of issues from Aboriginal deaths in police custody and drug trafficking to nuclear testing and secret intelligence services.Did you know?\nThe Royal Commission Act was amended in 2013 to enable the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse to hold private sessions.

Royal commissions can also be important in raising community awareness and interest in a particular area of community concern and encouraging individuals and groups to not only make submissions to the royal commission but also undertake their own initiatives (including undertaking petitions and demonstrations and using the media) to in\ufb02uence a change in the/uni00A0law.\nHowever, one problem associated with royal commissions is that they may lose credibility in situations \nwhere the government of the day, which determines the terms of reference, chooses not to include any areas that might be potentially politically damaging for them (i.e. may lead to a loss of voter support) or focuses on areas that might gain voter support. Similarly, as mentioned above, a royal commission may lose credibility if too many witnesses are summoned to give evidence against their will and forced to answer questions that would not be permitted in a traditional courtroom. If the public loses con\ufb01dence in the methods used by a royal commission to gain evidence and information they may be less willing to support any recommendations made for changes to the/uni00A0law.\nThe ability of royal commissions to in\ufb02uence law reform is summarised in Source/uni00A04.\n14_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   518 10/10/2017   1:35 PM",

They have complementary roles in \nlaw reform.Make sure you are able to evaluate the ability of both parliament and courts to respond to the need for law reform, which includes considering its strengths and weaknesses. Recent examples are a good way to demonstrate strengths and weaknesses.Study tip\nabrogate  \nto cancel or abolish a court-made law by passing an Act of ParliamentIn this topic you will consider the ability of the parliament and the courts to respond to the need for \nlaw reform. This may be because of recommendations made to them by law reform bodies, commissions \nor committees which recommend changes in the law, or because individuals or the media have highlighted the need for change.\nThe ability of/uni00A0parliament to/uni00A0respond to/uni00A0the need \nfor/uni00A0law/uni00A0reform\nParliament, as the supreme law-making body, is able to make new laws and change existing laws in \nresponse to changing needs and demands. It can ensure the law is kept up to date with and re\ufb02ects changes in society, the development of new technologies, and ever-changing domestic, international, economic and political circumstances.\nSome of the features of parliaments that enable them to respond to law reform are set out in Source 2.\nHowever, at the same time, parliament also has some limitations in its ability to change the law. \nParliament is an/uni00A0elected and supreme law-making \nauthority\nOne of the main strengths of the state and Commonwealth parliaments is that they are supreme  \nlaw-making bodies, with the power to make and change any law within their own jurisdiction or area of law-\nmaking power. This notion that parliament is a supreme law-making body is also sometimes referred to as sovereignty of parliament, and means that the parliaments have overriding authority when exercising the law-making powers given to them. Parliaments are not bound by previous Acts of Parliament and can change or amend existing law whenever the need arises.\nFurthermore, while courts can change the meaning of the law through their interpretation of the \nwords and phrases in an Act of Parliament, parliaments can abrogate  or cancel law made by courts \n14_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   520 10/10/2017   1:35 PM",

However, parliament is not able to  change law  if it is considered to  be \nultra vires or outside their law-making powers.\nThe state  and Commonwealth parliaments are  elected by  the people to  make laws  on their behalf. As \nsuch, the parliaments have  an ability and responsibility to  change the law  so that it re\ufb02ects the changing \nviews, values and needs of the people. However, members of parliament may  be reluctant to  respond \nto demands to  change the law  in situations where there are  con\ufb02icting community views on an issue or \nthey fear losing voter support. For  example, state  parliaments have  generally been reluctant to  introduce \ncontroversial laws  allowing people the right to  make end-of-life decisions (euthanasia) despite opinion \npolls suggesting the reform has the support of the majority of people. This reluctance may  be due to  \nmembers of parliament fearing they may  lose  the electoral support of a vocal minority or being unwilling \nto vote  against their party\u2019s policy stance.\nSimilarly, because elections are  held every  three (federal) or four years (state) years, members of  \nparliament can be reluctant to  support changes in the law  in situations where the bene\ufb01ts of the law  reform \nwill not be seen by  the voters for  many years. For  example, the bene\ufb01ts of changing the law  to encourage \nmore environmentally sustainable forms of energy or mineral exploration may  take  many years to  be \nquanti\ufb01ed and evident to  voters, which may  not necessarily help members of parliament win or retain \ntheir seats at  a forthcoming election.\nThe ability of parliament to  respond \nto the need for  law  reform may  also \nbe diminished by \ufb01nancial or budget \nrestrictions. For  example, implementing \nlaw reform to  improve the conditions \nin youth and asylum seeker detention \ncentres or provide more support for \npeople a\ufb00ected by  or at  risk of family \nviolence can be very  costly and, as with \nall spending, involve  an opportunity \ncost (i.e. spending money in one area surrenders the ability to spend it in \nanother/uni00A0area).\nParliament can investigate the/uni00A0need for/uni00A0law/uni00A0reform\nAnother reason why  parliament is e\ufb00ectively able to  respond to  the need for  law reform is because it \nis able to  thoroughly investigate the need for  a change in the law,  and measure public support for  any \nproposed change. It can also investigate and change whole areas of/uni00A0law.\nFor example, both the state  and Commonwealth parliaments have  the ability to  initiate royal  \ncommissions and have  an extensive committee system that allows for  parliamentary committees to  be \nset up to  investigate issues and areas of potential law  reform. These investigatory bodies are  also able \nto obtain community input on the need for  law reform through a variety of measures including public \nhearings, consultation meetings and written submissions in response to  discussion or issues papers. \nFurthermore, as committees are  usually made up of members of the government, opposition and the \ncrossbench, their \ufb01ndings usually have  bipartisan support (i.e. support of both major parties).\nOne problem with parliamentary inquiries and royal  commissions, however, is that their investigations \ncan be very  time-consuming (for example, may  take  years) and parliament is not compelled to  adopt any  \nof their recommendations.Source 2 Three features of parliaments that enable them to  \nsupport law reformPARLIAMENT \nHAS THE ABILITY TO RESPOND TO  \nTHE NEED FOR  \nLAW REFORM \nBECAUSE:it is an elected and supreme\nlaw-making authority with \nextensive power to make and change the law on behalf of the people\nit can thoroughly investigatethe need for a change in the law,including investigating and changing whole areas of law\nit can respond relatively quickly to the needs and demands of the communitycodify (codi\ufb01cation) \nto collect all law on one \ntopic together into a single code or statute\n14_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   521 10/10/2017   1:35 PM",

Parliament \ncan also delegate its law-making powers to  subordinate authorities (like local councils, government \ndepartments, statutory authorities such as Australia Post  and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation \nBoard) to  make rules and regulations on their behalf \u2013 referred to  as secondary legislation (or delegated \nlegislation).\nOther than local councils, however, subordinate authorities are  not elected bodies and as such may  \nnot have  the desire to  listen to  the views of their community and implement law  reforms that re\ufb02ect the \ncommunity needs as elected members of parliament do.  Furthermore, subordinate authorities may  not \nfeel the compulsion to  consult with members of  their communities about the need to  change the law  or \ndiscuss and debate proposed changes to  rules and regulations.\nThe process of changing a law  through parliament is very  time-consuming because a proposal for  \nchange must pass through several  stages  of discussion and debate in both houses of parliament and \nparliamentary sitting days  are limited.

For example, science, technology \nand medical advancements take place at such a rapid pace that governments cannot investigate the need \nfor change in the law and gather community opinions quick enough to keep pace with the change.\nSubordinate authorities, like local councils, are often more assessable to the general public than \nparliament and are more able to accurately measure the need for law reform in local communities and with regard to con\ufb01ned issues. They also may have more localised and specialised expertise in speci\ufb01c areas or \ufb01elds and can more e\ufb00ectively make and change the laws in their particular/uni00A0\ufb01eld. Other factors that can inhibit the speed with which parliament can respond to the need for change in the law including the composition of parliament, the limited number of sitting days and the urgent need for law reform in some cases.\nThe strengths and weaknesses of parliament in its ability to respond to the need for law reform are set \nout in Source 5 below.\nSTRENGTHS WEAKNESSES\nParliament is an elected supreme law-\nmaking body with the power to make and change any law within their own jurisdiction or area of law-making power.Parliament is not able to change law if it is ultra vires or outside their law making powers.\nParliament can make and change laws as the need arises to ensure the law reflects the changing needs, views and values of society. Members of parliament may be reluctant to legislate in areas where there are conflicting community views, or the benefits will not be seen for many years, through fear of losing voter support.\nParliament can ask the VLRC the establish committees and royal commissions to thoroughly investigate the need for a change in the law.Reforming the law can be very time-consuming (given a proposal for change must pass through several stages of discussion and debate in both houses of parliament and parliamentary sitting days are limited) and expensive. a Western Australian National party member (who generally supports the Liberal\u2013National \nCoalition). The ALP was able to form a minority government with the promised support of the one member of the Australian Greens and three of the four independent members \u2013 which gave the ALP 76 votes in the 150 seat lower house \u2013 enabling them to get their policy agenda and bills passed through the lower/uni00A0house.\nThe minority ALP government, however, faced many problems during its three-year term \nincluding the fact that it was forced on various occasions to change its policies and election promises to maintain the support of the lower house crossbench and also have their bills passed by a hostile Senate. This made it difficult, on occasion, for the government to fully respond, as it might have desired to address the need for law reform. Most famously, the Gillard Government was forced to break its election promise not to introduce a carbon tax, although other major reforms like the introduction of plain packaging for cigarettes and paid parental leave were successfully introduced during the government\u2019s term in office.\nSource 4  \nSubordinate authorities such as Australia Post can make delegated legislation on behalf of parliament\ncont.\n14_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   523 10/10/2017   1:35 PM",

In a  \njoint judgment, in which the High Court found that there was  inconsistency, the Court stated  \nin the first paragraph:\nThe only issue which this Court can  decide is a  legal issue. Is the Marriage Equality \n(Same Sex)  Act 2013, enacted by  the Legislative Assembly for  the Australian Capital Territory, \ninconsistent with either or  both of two  Acts of  the Federal Parliament:/uni00A0the Marriage Act 1961 \nand the Family Law Act 1975? That question must be  answered \"Yes\". Under the Constitution \nand federal law as it now  stands, whether same-sex marriage should be provided for  by \nlaw (as a  majority of  the Territory Legislative Assembly decided) is a  matter for  the Federal \nParliament.LEGAL  \nCASEexample, as mentioned in Chapter/uni00A013, in the Trigwell case (State Government Insurance Commission v Trigwell \n(1978) 142 CLR 617)/uni00A0the High Court preferred not to  overrule an earlier precedent set by  the Supreme \nCourt of Appeal to  make landowners responsible for  their livestock (animals) that stray onto highways \ncausing road accidents \u2013 stating the law  should be changed by  the parliament.\nWhile courts can play a role in in\ufb02uencing changes in the law  through the ability of higher courts \nto change existing precedents and interpret the meaning of legislation, their ability to  do so  is limited \nbecause courts can only change the law  when a case is brought before them and in relation to  the issues \ninvolved in that case.  This is reliant on individuals and organisations being willing to  undertake costly, \ntime-consuming and often stressful court action and pursue the appeals process with no guarantee of  \na successful outcome. However, even  if a court challenge is unsuccessful it may  gain signi\ufb01cant media \ncoverage  and help increase awareness of the possible need to  change/uni00A0a/uni00A0law.\nJudges make decisions without/uni00A0fearing the/uni00A0loss of/uni00A0voter \nsupport\nJudges are  politically independent and may  be more willing to  make a \u2018controversial\u2019 ruling that changes \nthe law  than members of parliament who may  fear electoral backlash (i.e. the loss of voter support). \nFor example, the High Court\u2019s decision in the Mabo case (Mabo v Queensland (No  2) (1992) 175 CLR 1) \nrecognising limited land rights for  Indigenous Australians established a new area of  law that was  later \nenshrined in the Native Title Act  1993 (Cth) by  the Australian Parliament.\nHowever, judges still need to  wait for  a case to  come before them to  be able to  make a ruling. Even \nif a case is brought before them, judges are  restrained by  considering the legal issues in dispute. See for  \nexample, the case of  Commonwealth v Australian Capital Territory [2013] HCA 55 (12 December 2013). In \nthat case,  the High Court could not make any  legal determination on whether same-sex marriage ought \nbe allowed in Australia.

This is reliant \non parties being willing and financially able to  pursue a case.\nJudges are independent from the parliament and can make decisions without fearing the loss of voter \nsupport.Judges are not elected by the people and may make decisions that do not reflect the views and values of the community. \nJudges can declare legislation invalid if it was made ultra vires.Some judges can adopt a more conservative, rather than activist, approach and more narrowly interpret legislation in cases where their decisions will lead to  major or \ncontroversial law change.\nCourts can make a ruling that highlights a problem and raise community awareness for the need for law change.Parliament may abrogate (or cancel) common law (other than cases involving the interpretation of the Constitution).\nSource 8 The ability of the courts to  respond to  the need for law reform\n14_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   527 6/12/2017   2:27 PM",

By  contrast, \nover the last decade, the legal system has increasingly \ntaken a more compassionate approach when dealing with cases involving euthanasia. Prosecutions are  \nrare and in cases that have  been pursued, judges have  \nimposed relatively lenient sentences. For  example, \nin 2013, a 73-year-old man who pleaded guilty to  the attempted murder of his 84-year-old wife, after trying to  ease her su\ufb00ering and end both of their lives, \nwas spared imprisonment and ordered to  serve an \n18-month supervised community correction order. Supreme Court Justice Betty King showed mercy when imposing the sentence and accepted that the o\ufb00ender was  acting out of  love  for his wife, who was  \nsu\ufb00ering from dementia and Parkinson\u2019s disease and was  unable to  orally accept food or adequately \ncommunicate. When passing sentence, Justice King commented that with Australia\u2019s ageing population, the problems surrounding assisted dying would continue to  increase. She emphasised, however, that, \nunder the current law,  individuals are  not permitted \nto end the life of another person regardless of their \npersonal views and circumstances. Interestingly, Justice King also commented that a suspended sentence would have  been an appropriate sanction \nto be imposed on the accused but they had just been \nabolished as a sentencing option in Victoria.\n14_FIL_JO_SB34_14e_10363_TXT_SI.indd   531 10/10/2017   1:35 PM",

This understanding is based on observations of their environment, both \nabiotic and biotic factors, and experience of what is needed by humans, plants and animals \nto survive in Australian environments.\nToday, knowledge of plant and animal adaptations to habitat and season is still essential for \nfinding food and materials in Australian environments. Knowing likely places and times to \nhunt kangaroos, collect bogong moths and gather certain fruits are essential for survival, \nand Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples completed this for thousands of years. \nIn the context of life on Earth, this makes them very successful.\nThis knowledge of the adaptations of plants \nand animals has not just been u ed for hunting \nand gathering. In recent decades, researchers \nhave found, through sources such as Aboriginal \nand Torres Strait Islanders oral histories, \narchaeological evidence and early colonists\u2019 \nrecords, that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander \npeoples used their knowledge to manage the \nland, till the soil, sow seeds and harvest crops. \nThey managed, and continue to manage, the \nland, encouraging animals to populate certain \nareas where they may be hunted sustainably, \nconstructing weirs and traps on waters to \nsustainably harvest eels, fish and other aquatic \nlife, and using fire to create beneficial ecosystems.LINK1A LIVING OR \nNON-LIVING\nFigure  7C\u201310  The Brewarrina fish \ntraps on the Barwon River in New \nSouth Wales are an example of \nAboriginal Australian aquaculture. \nThey are a series of dry-stone \nweirs and ponds arranged across \nthe river to create fish traps, \nwhere fish were herded into the \nponds and the openings quickly \nshut with a few rocks. The walls \nof the traps are different heights, \nallowing them to be used at \ndifferent water levels. According \nto the Dreaming an ancestral \nbeing called Baiame, threw his net \nacross the Barwon, creating their \ndesign. The place is extremely \nsignificant to the Aboriginal \npeople of Western and Northern \nNSW for whom it is imbued with \nspiritual, cultural, traditional and \nsymbolic meanings.\nFigure  7C\u20139  An Aboriginal elder on Cave Hill, Pitjantjatjara \nCommunity, Central Australia  pointing out features of \nthe landscapeIndigenous  \nthe original or \nearliest known \ninhabitants of \nan area; also \nreferred to as \nFirst Peoples or \nFirst Nations           \n     \n      \n       \n        \n        \n     \n      \n       \n        \n        \n       \n       \n              \n                \n \n                \n                \n               \n              \n      \n             \n            \n              \n             \n    \n              \n           \n              \n             \n  \n             \n                   \n     \nTitle \nthe research \nquestion under \ninvestigation; \nincludes \ninformation about \nwhat is being testedLogbook Notes\nThe title should \ninclude reference to \nthe variables being \nchanged (independent \nvariable) and  \nmeasured (dependent \nvariable), along with \nenough detail for \nthe reader to decide \nwhether they want to \ncontinue reading.Title\n1 What temperature do enzymes work at?\n2 What is the optimal temperature for the enzyme catalase to break \ndown hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water?VIDEO 6A\u20131 \nLOGBOOK EXAMPLE   \nIntroduction In the introduction (to \na poster) it can also be \nappropriate to present \na labelled diagram of \nthe concept/idea being \ninvestigated.1 Enzymes are essential to help reactions proceed more efficiently, in \norder to sustain life. They are made of proteins, which are coded for \nby an organism\u2019s DNA, and they are specific to the substance they \nact on.\n2 The enzyme catalase reacts with the substrate hydrogen peroxide \n(H2O2), breaking it down into water and oxygen (products) in a \ncatabolic reaction. Catalase is primarily found in the liver and is \nimportant in protecting the organism from damage caused by \nhydrogen peroxide, which is constantly produced by mammals.\n           \n          \n  p           \ntemperat re  ery enzyme has an optimal tem erature  at which \nits rate of reaction is hi hest w      \nw th the substrat  The gen ral ru e for thi  s that, a  temperature \nincre ses, the rate  reaction inc eases ntil optimal tempera ure \ns           \n       y     \nth  en yme  Den tur ti n i  an irreversibl  process c used by the \nhydr n b nds bein  b oken  e troyin  the chara teri t c 3D \nstru ture of the protein and therefore changing its active site so it \ncannot bind to the subst ate.\nTh  l f i i          \nsimilar to that f a lamb, where the li er onta ning catalase was \nbtain d f om.

It is also fluid \u2013 \nthat is, the phospholipids and proteins are able to move around within each layer. Referring \nto plasma membranes in this way is known as the fluid mosaic model  (see Figure 1B\u20134 on the \nprevious page).\nRecall that a phospholipid consists of a head and two tails, and the tails consist of fatty \nacids. If these fatty acids only have single bonds between the carbon atoms (i.e. they are \n\u2018saturated\u2019), then they can pack together tightly. If the fatty acids have some double bonds \nbetween carbon atoms (\u2018unsaturated\u2019), then they pack together less tightly. If there are \nunsaturated fatty acids in the tails, they have some double bonds between carbon atoms and \nthis makes them pack together less tightly. So more unsaturated fatty acids in the tails of \nthe phospholipids increases the fluidity of the plasma membrane (Figure 1B\u20135).Check-in questions \u2013 Set 1\n1  What does the plasma membrane divide or separate (what is on either side of it)?\n2  List the key components of a plasma membrane.\n3  Which part of the plasma membrane is hydrophilic?\nFluid mosaic \nmodel   \na model that \nrepresents \nthe plasma \nmembrane as \na combination \n(mosaic) of \nphospholipids, \nproteins, \ncholesterol and \ncarbohydrates \nthat gives the \nmembrane its \nfluid nature\nHO C CO\nHC CHH\nHH\nHH\nHH\nHH\nHH\nHH\nHH\nHC C C C C C HSaturated fatty acid\nUnsaturated fatty acidSaturated lipid Saturated lipids only\nUnsaturated lipidHOC CO\nHC CHH\nHH\nHH\nHH HH\nHH\nHH\nHC CC C\nC C\nH\nMixed saturated and\nunsaturated lipids\nFigure  1B\u20135  Double bonds between carbon atoms in unsaturated fatty acids cause the carbon chain \nto kink.

The \nfirst prokaryote \u2013 the one doing the engulfing \u2013 was then able to take on the respiratory \nfunction of the aerobic prokaryote that it engulfed. The first prokaryote did not break \ndown the aerobic prokaryote; instead, it retained it and gained its aerobic function.

For a successful reaction, the molecules need to move into \nand around the cell at the correct rate. They also need to be in the correct concentration for \nspecific chemical reactions to occur.\nA eukaryotic cell is relatively large, making it more difficult for chemical reactions to occur \nefficiently within it. This problem is overcome by having smaller compartments within the \ncell. Organelles are membrane-bound compartments within a cell that perform specific \nfunctions. Each individual organelle (except ribosomes) has a plasma membrane. This \nmembrane enables the organelle to maintain the concentrations of molecules at levels that \nallow the reactants to interact with each other at optimal rates. The compartmentalisation \nwithin organelles also allows various chemical reactions to occur simultaneously in different \nplaces without interfering with each other (Figure 1D\u20131).\n18\nCHAPTER 1 CELLULAR STRUCTURE\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

For example, you can use steps to describe the process \nof protein synthesis. You will meet this process in detail in Unit 3. Using steps in this way \nwill enable you to deepen your understanding and boost your ability to remember the key \norganelles and their functions.\nThe process of protein synthesis is outlined in diagrammatic form in Figure 1D\u20135. The \nsteps in this process are as follows:\n1  Conversion of DNA to RNA\n \u2022Within the nucleus, which contains the genetic material, the DNA is transcribed \nto build RNA, which leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore.\n2  Conversion of RNA to protein (translation)\n \u2022RNA is translated at a ribosome, which synthesises the corresponding protein. If the \nprotein is destined for the outside of the cell or the plasma membrane, the ribosome \nis attached to the rough  endoplasmic reticulum.\n3  Transportation of protein\n \u2022The rough endoplasmic reticulum transports the protein in a vesicle to the Golgi \napparatus. \n4  Packaging of protein\n \u2022The Golgi apparatus modifies and packages the protein into a vesicle, ready for \nexporting out of the cell.\n5  Secretion of protein (exocytosis)\n \u2022The protein is released to the extracellular environment of the cell.\nCreating flashcards\nA further strategy to help you remember the functions of the organelles is to use the \ndiagrams and definitions from Table 1D\u20131 to create flip cards (flashcards).

This is called plasmolysis  \n(Figure 2B\u20138).\nWhen a plant cell is in a hypotonic  environment, free water enters \nthe plant cell, the plasma membrane pushes against the cell wall \nand the vacuole expands \u2013 the cell is described as turgid . The \nplant cell will not burst, due to the rigidity of its cell wall.\nHypertonicIsotonic\nHypotonicH2O\nH2O\nH2O\nFigure  2B\u20137  Tonicity, the concentration of solutes \nin an external environment, can affect the volume \nof a plant cell.

In these reports, \nthe chief examiner will note acceptable definitions. Some d efinitions have several key \ncomponents, and if you miss any component you will not achieve full marks.\nHow to explain\nCommand terms  are important when you are answering questions, as they indicate \nwhat you need to do to attain full marks. Explain  is an example of a command term used \nregularly in assessment situations. To explain means to give a detailed account of causes, \nreasons or mechanisms or to essentially say why something happened. Consider the \nfollowing question:\nQuestion : Identical pieces of potato (all of the same mass) were placed in each of four \nbeakers containing a solution. They were left for 30\u00a0minutes. Explain which piece of \npotato would have the largest loss of mass after 30\u00a0minutes.  (2 marks)\nAnswer :\n \u2022Water moves by osmosis from high free water concentration to low free water \nconcentration across a semi-permeable membrane.\n \u2022Therefore, for there to be a loss of mass, water must be moving out of the potato, \nso high free water must be inside the cell and low free wat er outside the cell \n(beaker A or B).\n \u2022Osmosis occurs faster at a higher temperature as the molecules have more  \nkinetic energy.\n \u2022Therefore, beaker A will show the greatest loss of mass in the 30 minutes.\nNotice that this answer is set out in four dot points. The question is worth 2 marks and  \nthis often equates to four points being required for full marks. Examiners don\u2019t mark you \ndown in Biology for using dot points in your answer, so if dot points help, use them.\nAn acronym you might find useful when answering questions is DER, which stands for:\n \u2022Define  \u2013 include key and relevant definitions in your answ er, for key content words.\n \u2022Explain  \u2013 give a detailed account of causes, reasons or m echanisms relevant to  \nthe question.\n \u2022Relate  back to the question \u2013 relate your explanation to the  information provided in \nthe question, so the assessor can clearly see the link.Figure  2B\u201310  Set-up of a student experiment investigating the loss of mass from potato10% glucose \nat 30\u00b0CA B C D\nPotato\n10% glucose \nat 5\u00b0CDistilled water\nat 30\u00b0CDistilled water\nat 5\u00b0CVIDEO 2B\u20132  SKILLS: \nHOW TO EXPLAIN\n54\nCHAPTER 2 CELLULAR FUNCTIONING\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

Keep in mind that the assessments are not trying to trick you. Their role is \nto assess your knowledge and understanding by challenging you to apply what you have \nlearned. You know that an isotonic solution is one that has the same solute concentration \nas the cell\u2019s internal environment; therefore, the isotonic point is the point at which the \nconcentration of the solution is the same as the concentration of the cell.\nConsider this example:\nQuestion : A student is investigating the change in mass of apple pieces when placed \nin a range of salt solutions. The average mass change of the apple pieces after several \nhours is shown in the figure. Using the data presented, determine the isotonic point \nand give reasons for your decision.\nNote: A positive mass change is a gain in mass. A negative mass change is a mass loss.Here is an example of what this looks like:\nQuestion : A student was carrying out an experiment using an artificial semi-\npermeable membrane.

Consider the cube in Figure 2C\u20132. The surface area of \nthe cube is calculated by adding the areas of the exposed sides. The cube (shown at left) has \nsix exposed surfaces, which you can see when the cube is \u2018unfolded\u2019 to form the net (shown \non the right). Each of the six surfaces measures 1 unit by 1 unit, so 6 \u00d7 12 gives the total \nsurface area of the cube.

As the \u2018cell\u2019 grows, its surface area and the volume increase, but not at \nthe same speed.

Large cells need more \noxygen and nutrients, and they have a lot of wastes \nthey need to get rid of compared to smaller cells. \nSo eventually, a growing cell reaches a point where \nexchange isn\u2019t fast enough to support the volume of \nthe cell and keep its internal conditions within the \nsafe range. In this situation, the cell will eventually \ndie. Therefore, growing cells tend to divide to form \ntwo smaller cells when they reach a certain size.

Your Units 1\u20134 assessments \nwill definitely include data and \nassociated graphical representations, \nand, therefore, it is valuable to practise.\nConsider the graph in Figure 2C\u201311. \nIf you are not comfortable with \ninterpreting graphs, choose one point \non the curve and determine what \nthat point is \u2018saying\u2019 by referring to \nthe axes. For example, the first point \n(reading from left to right on the \ngraph) says that when a cell has a side \nlength of 0.1  cm, its SA:V ratio is 60:1. \nThe second point from the left says \nthat a cell with side length of 0.5  cm \nhas a SA:V ratio of 12:1 ... and so on. \nNow look for a trend. A trend  is the general direction in which something is going. In \nthis graph, the trend is that, as the side length increases, the SA:V ratio gets smaller.\nHere is an example to help you with these types of questions.\nQuestion : Using the data provided in the graph, what size cell would be the most \nefficient at gas exchange? Give reasons for your answer.

(2 marks)\nAnswer :\n \u2022To survive, a cell needs to exchange materials with its external environment \u2013 for \nexample, nutrients and oxygen in and wastes out. This exchange occurs across a \nplasma membrane.\n \u2022A large surface area (area of the plasma membrane that is exposed to the external \nenvironment) to volume (space within the cell) ratio is better for increasing the \nrate of movement of molecules across the cell membrane into/out of a cell, as \nthere is more surface through which to exchange materia ls.\n \u2022As a cell gets larger, its surface area and its volume increase, but the volume \nincreases more, so there is less surface area (SA) available per unit volume (V) \nfor exchange.\n \u2022This means a larger cell is not as efficient at exchanging materials as a small cell, \nas the SA:V ratio decreases as cell size increases.\nKey points to remember when answering this kind of question:\n \u2022Within your answer, incorporate relevant definitions to show your knowledge of \nthe content.\n \u2022Talk it through step by step: \u2018This happens, so this happens, and this means that ... \nso this occurs\u2019.\n \u2022Remember, you want to show your teacher or the examiner your knowledge.

But how do these terms relate to Biology, the study of living things? One way to \napply these terms to our living world is to understand that living things are constantly active, even if you can\u2019t see this activity. It is energy that fuels the work that sustains these activities.\nEnergy exists in different forms, but the forms of energy that are most important to life \non Earth are light (or radiant) energy, the chemical energy stored in food, and heat. In our living world, cells and organisms carry out reactions to transform these forms of energy into forms they can use. It doesn\u2019t matter whether the organism is a bacterium living on the rocks of hydrothermal vents in the depths of the ocean, a frog that freezes solid over winter and thaws months later when spring comes, or a microscopic tardigrade that can survive up to 30 years without food or water. All living things need energy and must have ways of capturing it, transforming it and storing it.\nFigure 2D\u20131 The wood \nfrog of Alaska spends nearly 7 months a year frozen, turning two-thirds of its body water into ice to survive the winter. \n67 2D ROLE OF CHLOROPLASTS AND MITOCHONDRIA\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

The remaining space in the mitochondrion is a fluid called \nthe matrix, and this contains many ribosomes due to the large number of enzymes (made \nof protein) that are needed for the reactions that occur during the Krebs cycle and the \nelectron transport chain.LINK 1D ORGANELLES\nCristae\nIntermembrane spaceOuter membraneInner membrane\nMatrix\nMitochondrial\nDNA\nFigure  2D\u201312  The mitochondrion is an organelle found in \neukaryotic cells, and is where aerobic cellular respiration \ntakes place, with different stages occurring in the matrix \n(Krebs cycle) and the cristae (electron transport chain).\nFigure  2D\u201313  Transmission electron microscope image of a \nmitochondrion\nPyruvate\nOxygen\nCarbon\ndioxideWater\n3.Electron\n transport\n chain\n (cristae)Glucose\nHydrogen2.

Generations of dairy farmers have been breeding cows that produce the most milk, and wheat farmers have been selecting the tallest and most robust wheat to produce the next generation. More recently, technology has allowed us to further manipulate the evolutionary path of organisms by direct manipulation of DNA. For example, we can alter the DNA of salmon to make them grow faster or introduce a trait into apples that stops them going brown. Our ability to exploit the features of organisms for our own benefit has just been taken a step further, with scientists at the University of Vermont, United Sates, using artificial intelligence (AI) (a\u00a0computer system with human-like thinking capabilities) and the stem cells of frogs to create the world\u2019s first living robot, the xenobot.\nScientists harvested frog stem cells, taken later in development, that would normally \ndevelop into skin (to form the architecture) or heart tissue (to contract and relax, allowing movement). They then used AI to test thousands of combinations of heart and skin tissue to work out how these configurations and shapes would behave in the real world. The AI combinations that showed positive simulation results were then built in the laboratory by scientists, using the harvested frog stem cells. The end result of this work was the xenobot.\nFigure 3A\u20131 The xenobot is smaller than a pinhead, \nless than 1 mm.\n92\nCHAPTER 3 CELLULAR REGENERATION AND REGULATION\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

Conception occurs in the fallopian tubes of a female when the sperm from a male fertilises an ovum (egg), producing a complete single cell. This single cell is known as a \nzygote .The xenobot is unable to eat or reproduce and survives for only a week. However, it is capable of walking, swimming, pushing or carrying objects, working cooperatively in a group and repairing itself if damaged. Scientists are hoping that studying the xenobot will help them to crack the code on how different types of cells communicate with each other. There is also hope that, in the future, xenobots may be further developed and built from a human patient\u2019s own cells, to be used for delivering drugs, to repair tissue or target cancer.\nThe potential of stem cells is not limited to the computerised world of AI.

What process \ncommences after implantation?\nGastrulation: germ layer development\nGastrulation occurs shortly after the implantation of the blastocyst into the uterine wall. It \nresults in the single-layered blastocyst developing into a three-layered gastrula. To do this, \nthe inner cell mass of the blastocyst subdivides by folding in upon itself.

The formation of these critical structures is \nthe developmental milestone that results in the gastrula becoming an embryo.\nCell specialisation\nThe inner cell mass of the blastocyst contains true embryonic stem cells.

So where do scientists access these cells?\nEmbryonic stem cells\nAs you read earlier in this chapter, embryonic stem cells are present in the developing embryo up to 5 days after fertilisation. The only way to source these types of cells is to harvest them from early embryos that have been donated for research purposes with the informed consent of their owners. In a laboratory, embryonic stem cells are transferred from the early embryo into a culture dish that contains a nutrient-rich medium (Figure 3A\u201316). If these stem cells are grown in favourable conditions, they will remain undifferentiated indefinitely. When scientists want to generate specific types of cells (such as heart, liver or muscle), they manipulate the growing conditions of the cells to get the desired outcome. They do this in the following ways:\n \u2022changing the chemical composition of the medium that the cells are grown in\n \u2022altering the nutrients provided to the cell\n \u2022directly modifying the stem cells by inserting genes.\nBeing able to reliably dictate the specialisation pathway of embryonic stem cells would significantly affect the treatment of many diseases.\nOocyte\nand sperm\nMorula\n(totipotent)\nBlastocyst\nInner cells\n (pluripotent)Day 5Day 3Day 0\nEmbryonic stem cells\nFigure 3A\u201316 The transfer of embryonic stem cells from an early embryo to a \nlaboratory culture dish, where cells can be manipulated to form specific types of specialised cellsPPS\n104\nCHAPTER 3 CELLULAR REGENERATION AND REGULATION\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",
  "Page 117": "Adult stem cells\nAdult stem cells can be more readily sourced than embryonic stem cells. The procedures \ninvolved in accessing adult stem cells are outlined below.\nBone marrow\nHaematopoietic stem cells are most commonly obtained from donor bone marrow. These \ncells will form all types of blood cells, including those that support our immune system. \nIn this procedure the donor is placed under general anaesthetic and the doctor inserts a \nhollow needle into the hip or the pelvic bone to access the bone marrow.\nAnother option is for the donor to receive several small injections that cause the bone \nmarrow to release stem cells into the blood. The blood is then passed through a machine \nthat separates out the stem cells before the blood is returned to the body.\nUmbilical cord blood\nThe collection of blood from the umbilical cord and placenta of newborn babies has \nbecome more common in recent years. This \u2018cord\u2019 blood contains the same type of \nhaematopoietic stem cells as those isolated from bone marrow. Cord blood is easy to \ncollect, with no harm to the mother or baby. It has been used for more than 20 years to \nsuccessfully treat a range of blood disorders. Perhaps the greatest advantage is that, if an \nindividual has had their cord blood stored and requires a transplant at any time in their \nlife, their own stem cells can be used, and these stem cells are considerably less likely to be \nrejected than those from a donor.\n \nFigure  3A\u201317  Two sources of haematopoietic stem cells. Left: A surgeon monitors the extraction of \nbone marrow from a patient. Right: The umbilical cord of a newborn baby is being cut.\nInduced pluripotent stem cells\nIn 2007, scientists first reported the use of a new type of human stem cell, known as \ninduced pluripotent stem cells  or iPSCs . An iPSC is a type of adult cell that is capable of \nbeing genetically programmed to revert back to an embryonic stem cell state. By turning \non specific genes, scientists are able to \u2018trick\u2019 the cell into expressing the pluripotent \ncharacteristics of embryonic stem cells instead of the multi- or uni-potent features of adult \nstem cells.\nThe discovery of iPSCs has been hailed as the \u2018holy grail\u2019 for cell biologists. Not only do \niPSCs help to overcome the ethical issues associated with the use of true embryonic stem \ncells, but preliminary testing suggests that they will revolutionise the field of regenerative \nmedicine.Induced \npluripotent stem \ncells (iPSCs) \ntypical adult \ncells that have \nbeen genetically \nreprogrammed \nto revert to an \nembryonic stem \ncell stateLINK\nLINK\nLINKUNIT 4\nUNIT 4\nUNIT 3\n105 3A WHERE DO NEW CELLS COME FROM ?\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",
  "Page 118": "Applications of stem cell therapy\nThe ability of stem cells to differentiate into many cell types makes them a vital asset in the \ntreatment of a wide range of disorders. As technology develops, and our understanding of \nthe way in which stem cells operate improves, the medical possibilities seem almost endless.\nPerhaps the area of medicine that will benefit most from our developing stem cell \nknowledge is regenerative medicine . This is a relatively new field involving the replacement, \nregeneration or engineering of human cells, tissues or organs to restore or establish normal \nfunction.\nBelow are some examples of the many ways in which stem cells are being used to help \nrestore function.\nTissue regeneration\nTissue regeneration is used primarily for the \nregeneration of skin in burns victims. The skin \nis able to repair itself after damage by using its \nown epithelial stem cells. In burns victims, the \npatient\u2019s own epithelial stem cells are harvested \nand grown in a laboratory. Once new layers of \nskin have formed, these are grafted directly onto \nthe patient in areas where the skin has been lost.\nIn 2013, a team of researchers reported that they \nhad successfully used human stem cells to create \nblood vessels in mice. While this procedure is yet \nto be trialled in humans, doctors are optimistic \nthat in the near future the technique will be used \nto replace damaged blood vessels in humans and \ntreat a range of cardiovascular disorders.\nCell deficiency treatment\nMany disorders are the result of a deficiency in a \nparticular type of cell within an organ. Examples \nare type 1 diabetes, which results when specialised \npancreatic cells fail to produce insulin, and \nAlzheimer\u2019s, which is caused by the death of a \nspecific type of cell within the brain. Scientists are \nhopeful that, by developing stem cells into specific \ntypes, they will be able to introduce these new \nhealthy cells into the problematic organs and repair \nthe damaged tissue, restoring normal function. For \nexample, macular degeneration, a disorder that \ncauses 50% of all blindness in Australia, is caused by \nthe death of a specific type of retinal cell. If scientists \ncan grow these retinal cells from stem cells in a \nlaboratory and then introduce them into the retina, the new cells should be able to repopulate \nthe damaged area and restore the person\u2019s sight.Regenerative \nmedicine  \na new field \nof medicine \nthat replaces, \nregenerates \nor engineers \nhuman cells, \ntissues or organs \nto restore normal \nfunction\nFigure  3A\u201318  A doctor prepares a skin graft grown from human \nstem cells for transfer to a patient.\nFigure  3A\u201319  Laboratory-grown human blood vessels\n106\nCHAPTER 3 CELLULAR REGENERATION AND REGULATION\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",
  "Page 119": "Haematopoietic stem cells harvested from bone marrow (or cord blood) are used routinely \nby doctors to treat a wide range of blood disorders caused by cell deficiencies. In the case \nof leukaemia (cancer of the blood) treatment, doctors use chemotherapy to destroy the \npatient\u2019s existing bone marrow. They then introduce donor haematopoietic stem cells into \nthe patient\u2019s bone marrow, restoring the person\u2019s ability to produce healthy blood cells. \nHaematopoietic stem cells are also used in the treatment of many types of anaemia, as well \nas a range of cancers that involve the use of chemotherapy or radiation treatment.\nOrgan transplants\nAround 1400 Australians are currently on a waiting list for an organ transplant. The \nwaiting time for transplants ranges from 6 months to 4 years, but in some situations \nthe recipient must wait even longer. Stem cell technology offers hope for these patients. \nScientists are hopeful that they will one day be able to use stem cells, not only to grow \ntissue, but to replicate the organ itself. Using stem cells in this way has the added benefit \nof reducing the risk of transplant rejection, as doctors will be able to use the patient\u2019s own \nstem cells to grow the organ.\nIn 2015, American scientists used induced pluripotent stem cells to grow the first miniature \nbeating heart. While hearts developed in this way are still a long way from replicating \nthe exact structure of the human heart, this was an important breakthrough and has the \nmedical community excited about the potential use of stem cells in organ donation. \nResearch\nStem cell therapy is not the only way in which stem cells are used.

  "Page 120": "Ethics and stem cell therapy\nThe main ethical concern about stem cells relates to the \nuse of embryonic stem cells. Some people believe that life \nbegins at conception and that harvesting embryonic stem \ncells from a blastocyst is the equivalent of destroying the \nlife of a potential human being. Harvesting techniques \nhave come a long way, and now scientists are able to isolate \none embryonic stem cell from the blastocyst, leaving the \nrest intact. The use of induced pluripotent stem cells also \nhelps to overcome the ethical issues associated with early \nembryonic harvesting, as adult cells are manipulated to \nmimic the properties of embryonic stem cells.\nThere are also concerns about the use of animals in stem cell \nresearch. Often, human stem cells are inserted into other \nanimals, most commonly mice. This raises ethical questions \nabout the possible creation of an organism that is part \nhuman and part other species.\nThe use of adult stem cells does not cause the same \nobjections as that of embryonic stem cells.

As the third week of pregnancy \ncommences, the inner cell mass of the blastocyst begins to differentiate, giving rise to \nthe three different layers of cells.\nNote that, prior to gastrulation, cells that make up the inner mass of the blastocyst are \npluripotent. Once gastrulation commences and germ layers begin to form, the stem cells \nbegin to lose their \u2018specialisation power\u2019 and become multipotent.\nIt can be tricky to remember which germ layers give rise to which areas of the body. \nBelow are some tips to help you with this.\nEctoderm\nOf the three layers, the ectoderm  is the outermost layer. The prefix ecto means \u2018outer\u2019 or \n\u2018external\u2019, so it makes sense that this is the germ layer that gives rise to everything that \nis visible on the outside. An easy way to remember this is to think of the ectoderm as \nthe \u2018attracto-derm\u2019. What traits usually attract you to someone? Their eyes, hair, nails, \nskin? These are all exterior traits. Or perhaps you are attracted to people who show \nintelligence. The brain and nervous system also develop from the ectoderm.\nMesoderm\nThe next layer is the middle layer, the mesoderm . This one is the easiest of the three \nto remember. Think M for \u2018mesoderm\u2019 and also for \u2018muscle\u2019. The mesoderm gives \nrise to muscles and everything associated with muscle, such as bone, cartilage and \nligaments. The mesoderm is also responsible for producing the blood and vessels of our \ncardiovascular system. If you remember that muscles are needed to move blood through \nveins, this will help you to link these different areas. In addition, much of the excretory \nand genital systems are made of muscle (the bladder, for example), so they belong in this \ngerm layer too.\nEndoderm\nFinally, the endoderm  consists of everything else. The prefix endo  means \u2018inner\u2019, so this \ngerm layer gives rise to the innermost parts of an organism \u2013 that is, the digestive tract, \na \u2018tube\u2019 that runs from our mouth to our anus, and all the organs (and their linings) in \nbetween. This tube has an early branching point that forms the trachea, and then lungs, \nwhich are also formed by the endoderm germ layer.LINK4D THE \nEXCRETORY \nSYSTEM: \nELIMINATING \nWASTE\nLINK4B THE \nDIGESTIVE \nSYSTEM: \nGETTING THE \nNUTRIENTS \nWE NEEDVIDEO 3A\u20132  \nSKILLS: \nDIFFERENTIATION \nOF GERM LAYERS\n109 3A WHERE DO NEW CELLS COME FROM ?\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

The fundamental purpose of replication is the passing on of genetic material (DNA) to \nthe next generation of offspring. In eukaryotic cells, cellular division is referred to as mitosis . \nProkaryotic cells use a much simpler method known as binary fission .\nIn multicellular eukaryotes (plants, fungi, animals), the two main reasons for cellular \nreplication are growth and repair.\nGrowth\nAll forms of life begin as a single cell. For some organisms, this is also where it ends. Others, \nsuch as yourself, grow and develop from a single, fertilised egg cell into a complex organism \n\u2013 consisting of more than 37 trillion cells. Mitosis is responsible not only for the division of \ncells that results in this growth, but also for the development of these 37 trillion cells into \nthe 210 specialised types of cells inside your body.\nFigure  3B\u20137  Once a new multicellular organism is created by an egg cell being fertilised, growth and repair happens by mitosis.\nRepair\nAs you read in the introduction to this section, cells don\u2019t all have the same lifespan. The \nneurons that make up your brain tissue are thought to last a lifetime, but the cells that line \nyour stomach only last for a maximum of 5 days, because of the highly acidic environment \nthey are in. Your skin cells also have a short duration. At best they will last 4 weeks, but \nif you get a paper cut or graze your knee, this lifespan is cut drastically short. Thankfully, \nmitosis replaces worn-out or damaged cells, ensuring that, among other things, organs such \nas our stomach and our skin remain intact.\nSingle-celled (unicellular) organisms such as bacteria (prokaryotes) and protists (eukaryotes) \ndo not divide for the purpose of growth or repair. Instead, they undergo cell division as \na means of reproduction . These unicellular organisms reproduce asexually. You will read \nabout the variety of methods of asexual reproduction in Section 7A.

  "Page 140": "Distinguishing between prophase and interphase in diagrams\nOne of the more difficult skills you need to master in this topic is the ability to \ndistinguish between interphase and prophase when looking at diagrams or micrographs. \nAs DNA does not completely condense into chromosomes until late prophase, it can \nlook very similar in the different stages, making it difficult to correctly identify the \nstage(s) shown in a question.\nTake the following micrograph images, for example:\nA B C D E\nIt is easy to identify C as metaphase (chromosomes lined up along the metaphase plate in \nthe middle), D as anaphase (chromosomes being pulled towards opposite poles) and E as \ntelophase (two nuclei within the parent cell). Some students, however, find it difficult to \ndetermine whether cell A or B would be prophase. So how do you distinguish between them?\nFirst, you may have already realised that the cells are lined up in the order in which the \ncell would progress through each stage (that is, PMAT). This then makes A interphase \nand B prophase. However, in most cases, the question will not be kind enough to line up \nthe subphases in sequential order for you, so how else can you distinguish between the \ntwo stages accurately?\nRemember that prophase marks the breakdown of the nuclear membrane.

While previous sections of this \nchapter have focused on the important role of cell \ndivision in maintaining \u2018life\u2019, this section focuses \non the importance of programmed cell death in the \nhealthy development of an organism.\nEXPLAIN\nCell cycle regulation\nAs you learned in Section 3B, the eukaryotic cell cycle consists of a series of stages resulting \nin the production of two genetically identical daughter cells. Cells progress through the \ncell cycle in a highly regulated way, and this process depends on a variety of internal and \nexternal signals. These incoming signals ensure that the division of cells occurs under \nfavourable conditions that will only benefit the organism. This regulation is achieved \nthrough \u2018checkpoints\u2019 at various locations throughout the cell cycle. \nCell cycle checkpoints\nCell cycle checkpoints  are the controlling \nfactors that process internal and \nexternal signals before determining \nwhether a cell can proceed to the \nnext stage of division. Not only do \nthese checkpoints monitor the proper \ndivision of cells, they also ensure \nthat a compromised cell does not \ncontinue to divide and pass on its \ndefects (damaged or mutated DNA) \nto the next generation. If conditions \nare not favourable or if cell defects are \nidentified, the cell cycle can be halted \nuntil any issues are rectified.\nThere are many checkpoints throughout \nthe cell cycle. This chapter focuses on \nthe three most important ones, shown \nin Figure 3C\u20133.LINK3B THE CELL \nCYCLE\nCell cycle \ncheckpoints \ncontrol points \nwithin the cell \ncycle that ensure \naccurate division \nof the cellFigure  3C\u20132  HPV viewed under a \ntransmission electron microscope\nM checkpoint\nG2 checkpoint\nG1 checkpointG0\nCell leaves cycleMitosisCytokinesis\nS phase (DNA replication)G1 cell growthG2 cell growthInterphase\nFigure  3C\u20133  Checkpoints in the eukaryotic cell cyclePPS\n133 3C CELL CyCLE REGULATION  AND APOPTOSIS\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

It occurs at the transition of G1 into S phase \nand is the primary checkpoint of the cell. Its role \nis to ensure that all conditions are favourable for \ndivision, and it does this by monitoring a wide \nrange of internal and external signals. For the cell \nto progress to the next phase of the cycle, it must \nbe large enough to divide, have faultless DNA and \nenough nutrients and energy to sustain the cell \nthrough the division process. The G1 checkpoint \nalso monitors the growth factor signals a cell \nis receiving. Growth factors are important in \nstimulating the onset of division and there must \nbe enough of these signals present to drive the cell \nthrough the cycle.\nIf a cell fails to meet all these requirements, it will \nnot progress to S phase. If this occurs, it will either \nattempt to rectify the error or pass into the G0 state \nof cell cycle arrest. If favourable conditions that will \nallow the cell cycle to progress do not eventuate, \nthen the cell will remain in G0 permanently.\nReceiving the \u2018all clear\u2019 from the G1 checkpoint will result in the cell irreversibly \ncommitting to the rest of the cell cycle. Only extenuating circumstances (such as replication \nerrors) will prevent the cell from completing the cycle and producing two daughter cells.\nG2 checkpoint\nThe G2 checkpoint  checks for:\n \u2022DNA damage\n \u2022DNA replication accuracy\n \u2022cell size.\nThe G2 checkpoint is the second checkpoint of the cell cycle, occurring before the cell \nenters mitosis. At this checkpoint, cell size will again need to be deemed adequate for \ndivision. More importantly, the cell\u2019s DNA is assessed. P rior to the cell reaching the G2 \ncheckpoint it will have undergone S phase, where the DNA has been replicated. The most \nimportant role of this checkpoint is to make sure that the cell\u2019s DNA has been accurately \nand completely copied without any damage.\nIf damage or errors are detected, then the checkpoint will halt the cell\u2019s progression \nthrough the cycle until DNA replication is completed or the damaged DNA is repaired. \nIf the damage cannot be fixed, then the cell will be \u2018tagged\u2019 for destruction through a \ncontrolled process known as apoptosis .

  "Page 147": "M checkpoint\nThe M checkpoint  (also known as the spindle checkpoint) checks for spindle attachment \nto chromosomes. It occurs in the mitosis portion of the cell cycle, specifically between the \nmetaphase (hence the letter M) and anaphase subphases. Its role is to ensure that double \nchromosomes lined up along the metaphase plate of the cell are correctly attached to the \nspindle microtubules at their centromeres prior to the commencement of anaphase. The \nattachment of spindles to a chromosome\u2019s centromere gives rise to a complex known as a \nkinetochore  (Figure 3C\u20135). Correct formation of the kinetochore is essential to the accurate \nseparation of each double chromosome\u2019s sister chromatids during anaphase.\nRather than check for the correct formation of a kinetochore in all chromosomes, the \nM checkpoint scans the cell for any loose chromosomes not in the correct position. If such \nchromosomes are identified, the cell will cease mitosis, giving the spindle microtubules \ntime to attach to the deviant chromosome and align it correctly along the metaphase plate. \nOnce the chromosome is aligned, anaphase will proceed, resulting in the formation of two \nhealthy daughter cells. If alignment does not occur, then the cell will undergo apoptosis to \nprevent errors being passed on to the next generation of cells.\nCheckpoint proteins\nNow that you know what the major cell cycle checkpoints do, it is important to understand \nthat the checkpoints work in highly complex ways. Inside each cell is a core set of regulatory \nproteins  that form the cell cycle control system. These proteins keep the cell cycle steps in \norder, allowing the cell to operate normally. They do this by responding to internal and \nenvironmental signals. Under normal circumstances, signals will activate the regulatory \nproteins, causing the cell to progress in the cycle.

This uncontrolled spillage causes inflammation, which is detrimental not only to cells in neighbouring tissue, but also to the health and wellbeing of the organism.PPS\n141 3C CELL CyCLE REG ULATION  AND APO PTOSIS\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

At \neach of these checkpoints are regulatory proteins that respond to cellular signals, halting \nthe cell cycle if errors are detected.\nA regulatory protein is only able to detect errors and halt the cell cycle if it is structurally \nsound. If it is damaged, it will no longer be able to detect errors that should lead to the \nonset of apoptosis. This damage may result in the malfunction of the cell cycle, the division \nof defective cells and the possible onset of cancer.\nThe p53 protein: a master regulatory protein\nThe p53 protein  is a regulatory protein that operates at \nthe G1 and G2 cell cycle checkpoints. Its role is to detect \ndamaged DNA within a cell prior to the cell reaching \nmitosis and dividing. In healthy cells, p53 protein levels \nare low but in cells with damaged DNA, p53 protein \nlevels increase, for three major purposes:\n \u2022halting of the cell cycle\n \u2022enzyme repair of DNA\n \u2022activation of apoptosis.\nDamage to the p53 protein will result in an abnormal \nprotein that can no longer perform the three purposes \noutlined above. This will result in the division of cells \nwith damaged DNA and the rapid accumulation of \nmutated cells within the organism, which can lead to \ncancer (see Figure 3C\u201315). Many skin cancers are the \nresult of UV radiation in sunlight affecting the correct \nexpression of p53 proteins. The abnormal p53 proteins \nwithin the patient are unable to fix damaged DNA or \ntrigger apoptosis, and this has results in cancer, as shown \nin Figure 3C\u201315. For the cancer to develop, it must shut \ndown the activity of the p53 protein.\nCauses of regulatory protein malfunction\nUV radiation is not the only environmental factor that can \nresult in the production of abnormal regulatory proteins. \nCigarette smoke and prolonged exposure to pollution are \nboth known to cause cancer as a direct result of regulatory \nprotein dysfunction. Age and genetics also play a role in \nthe effectiveness of these proteins throughout the cell \ncycle checkpoints.p53 protein \na regulatory \nprotein that \nis vital to the \ndivision of \nhealthy cells\nFigure  3C\u201314  Top: Many factors \ncan disrupt the cell cycle and its \nregulatory proteins.

For cancer to develop, regulatory proteins must be faulty or \ndefective cells must acquire mechanisms that allow them to bypass the protective measures \nof regulatory proteins. For this reason, cancer is thought to develop through a series of \nprogressive steps rather than in one immediate action.  \nCells can become cancerous through the development of a series of mutations that occur \nin DNA. These mutations allow a faulty cell to pass through checkpoints undetected. This \nleads to the increased division of subsequent generations of faulty cells and the potential \nfor a tumour  to form. Initially, this tumour may be classed as benign  as it does not have \nthe ability to invade neighbouring tissue, but further mutations in the DNA of tumour \ncells could further increase cell division, resulting in the formation of a malignant  tumour. \nCells that make up a malignant tumour have the capacity to invade neighbouring tissue \nand impair the function of organs throughout the body. It is at this point that the cells are \nclassed as cancerous.\nAs a tumour progresses, the accumulation of DNA mutations becomes greater and occurs \nmore quickly. Research suggests that cancer cells may possess as many as 60 different DNA \nmutations. Individuals who are in the late stages of cancer will have significant changes in \ntheir genomes, including the complete loss of some chromosomes.\nPPS\n144\nCHAPTER 3 CELLULAR REGENERATION AND REGULATION\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

This shows that the presence of growth factor signals is \nnot needed for cancer cells to divide, unlike healthy cells, which do \nrequire growth factor signals.\nRandom \narrangement of \ncell layersHealthy cells form tissue through the uniform arrangement of cells. \nWhen normal cells become crowded, they stop dividing, but cancer \ncells do not stop; they continue dividing and form lumpy layers of \ncells (tumours).\nIncreased division A healthy cell is thought to divide about 50 times before it is \nworn out. Cancer cells divide many more times and much more \nfrequently than a typical healthy cell.\nMetastasis Cancer cells are able to enter the bloodstream or lymphatic fluid \nand travel to a new area in the body. This results in secondary \ntumours and furthers the spread of the cancer.\nAngiogenesis Cancer cells can trick the body into growing new blood vessels, \nwhich give them a direct supply of oxygen and nutrients.Culture \nthe growth \nof cells in \na nutrient \nmedium, e.g. \nagar\nMetastasis \nthe spread of \ncancer cells \nfrom their point \nof origin to a \nnew location in \nthe body\nAngiogenesis \nthe formation \nof new blood \nvessels\nThere are also a range of structural features that are visible in cancer cells.

It contains a series of complicated reactions, with \nmany of these occurring simultaneously within the dying cell. For the purpose of VCE \nBiology, it is useful to simplify these reactions into a series of distinct stages. Rather than \nmemorising chunks of complicated written information, it is also helpful to present each \nstage as a simple diagram organised into a flow chart, like the two examples shown on \nthe next page.\nSuggested study tip:  Create a flashcard for each stage. Have a summary of the event on \none side and the matching diagram on the other side of the card. Practise arranging the \ncards into the correct order. Alternate between using the written statements only, the \ndiagrams only, and then a combination of both.\nIntrinsic vs extrinsic apoptosis pathways\nAnother skill likely to be assessed is your ability to distinguish between the intrinsic and \nextrinsic pathways of apoptosis. When you are asked a question that relates to this topic, \nthe first thing you should do is identify where the \u2018death\u2019 signal has originated from. If it \nbegan inside the cell, the intrinsic pathway will be in operation. If it started outside the \ncell, this would mean activation of the extrinsic pathway.\nExtrinsic pathway tips:\n \u2022The extrinsic pathway is always  activated by an external death signal. This signal \nbinds to death receptors on the plasma membrane of the cell. From here, caspases are \nactivated, which triggers a pathway that releases cytochrome c from mitochondria.\n \u2022Typically, the extrinsic pathway is activated by cells of the immune system  acting to \ndestroy:\n \u25b6viral infected cells\n \u25b6immune cells that are no longer needed (B plasma cells)\n \u25b6immune cells that may attack healthy cells needed by the organism (autoimmune \ndisease).\nIntrinsic pathway tips:\n \u2022The intrinsic pathway is always  activated by an internal signal. This signal triggers \ncaspase activity, which releases cytochrome c from the mitochondria.\n \u2022The intrinsic pathway is activated when:\n \u25b6DNA is damaged\n \u25b6growth factor levels decrease or disappear completely.\nOnce the pathway has reached the mitochondria and released cytochrome c, the rest of \nthe pathway, regardless of it being extrinsic or intrinsic, is identical .UNIT 4 LINKVIDEO 3C\u20132  \nSKILLS: INTRINSIC \nVS EXTRINSIC \nAPOPTOSIS \nPATHWAYS \n146\nCHAPTER 3 CELLULAR REGENERATION AND REGULATION\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

In \nthis chapter, you will investigate how specialised cells are organised into systems, forming complex \nmulticellular organisms that rely on these sophisticated systems of cells for their survival. You will \nlearn how the systems within mammals work together to obtain and transport nutrients as well as \neffectively manage the build-up of waste. More specifically, you will look at the role of the digestive \nsystem in obtaining nutrients and energy, the significance of the endocrine system in achieving \nstability, and the critical role of the excretory system in removing waste.\nThe healthy functioning of an organism depends on the coordinated action of all systems working \ntogether. When this fails, malfunctions are inevitable. In this chapter you will explore some of the \nmalfunctions associated with each system and the consequences for the organism.\nPlants also rely on the organisation of cells into systems. This chapter looks at the structure of \nvascular plants, specifically how specialised cells form organised systems responsible for the intake \nand transport of water throughout the plant.\nCurriculum\nArea of Study 2 Outcome 2\nStudy Design Learning intentions \u2013 at the end of this chapter I will be able to:\nFunctioning systems\n\u2022  Specialisation and \norganisation of \nanimal cells into \ntissues, organs \nand systems with \nspecific functions: \ndigestive, endocrine \nand excretory4A   From cells to systems\n4A.1   Understand how the specific structure of a cell relates to \nits function and provide examples of specialised cells in the \ncontext of mammals, e.g. red blood cells and cardiac cells\n4A.2  Describe the relationship between cells, tissues, organs, organ \nsystems and organisms in mammals\n4A.3  Explain the need for transport systems in multicellular animals \nin terms of size, level of activity and surface area to volume ratioUNIT  \n1\nCHAPTER  \n4 FUNCTIONING SYSTEMSHOW DO ORGANISMS REGULATE THEIR FUNCTIONS?\n158\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

Their slimy, jelly-like features make them one \nof the world\u2019s most interesting organisms. Slime moulds were thought to be a type of \nfungus because of their similar reproductive features, but now they are classified as \nprotists, due to their gliding motion, which closely resembles that of an amoeba. Slime \nmoulds can take many forms. Most of the time they exist freely as what appear to be \nsingle cells, but in other instances they have been shown to clump together, forming \nmulticellular structures. A slime mould doesn\u2019t have a brain, but experiments have \nshown that it can learn the fastest route through a maze, and retain the memory of that \npath for over a year. Amazingly, scientists also found that when they placed oats (a food \nsource) in the pattern of Japan\u2019s cities, the slime mould formed a multicellular nutrient-\ncarrying network in almost exactly the same formation as the Japanese rail system!\nSo, what is a slime mould?

  "Page 186": "EXPLAIN\nThe human digestive system\nTo survive in our environment, we \nmust provide our body with a wide \nrange of nutrients. Autotrophs make \ntheir own food by converting inorganic \nsubstances into organic molecules, but \nas heterotrophs we are unable to do \nthis, so we rely on our diet to obtain the \nnutrients we need. It is the role of our \ndigestive system to break down our food \nand extract the vital nutrients needed \nfor survival.\nDigestion  is the process of breaking \nfood down into smaller molecules \nthat can then be absorbed into the \nbloodstream and transported to cells. \nThe digestive process occurs along the \ngastrointestinal tract , which is a long \nhollow tube that connects your mouth \nto your anus. This tube is open at both \nends and includes the digestive organs \n(oesophagus, stomach, small intestine \nand large intestine). In addition, the \naccessory organs (liver, gall bladder and \npancreas) also play an important role in \nthe digestive process.\nFigure 4B\u20132 shows the human gastrointestinal tract and associated organs.The lion\u2019s gut is much shorter than the deer\u2019s. Absorbing nutrients from plant matter \ntakes longer, so herbivores have longer digestive tracts. A difference you can\u2019t see in the \ndiagram is that the lion\u2019s large stomach contains ten times as much hydrochloric acid as \nthe deer\u2019s, to assist in the breakdown of meat. The deer belongs to a group of herbivores \nknown as ruminants, and its stomach has four chambers, the largest of which is called \nthe rumen. No mammals produce enzymes capable of breaking down cellulose, and this \nis a problem for herbivores, given the high content of cellulose in the grasses that make \nup their diet. In the rumen of the deer are specialised bacteria that produce the enzyme \ncellulase , which breaks down the cellulose for them.\nA final difference is in the caecum of the two animals. In the deer, the caecum is \nenlarged, because its function is similar to the rumen compartment of the stomach: \ncellulase-producing bacteria also live in the caecum and help in further breaking down \ncellulose so nutrients can be extracted. Because the lion does not eat plant material, its \ncaecum is basically redundant, which explains its insignificant size in carnivores.\nSo where does this leave the human digestive system? Most humans are omnivores, and \nso our digestive system is somewhere between that of a carnivore and a herbivore.

  "Page 187": "Types of digestion\nDigestion along the gastrointestinal tract occurs in two ways: physically and/or chemically. \nIt is the combined effort of both forms of digestion that results in our cells receiving the \nnutrients needed for survival.\nPhysical digestion\nPhysical digestion  (also known as mechanical digestion ) is the process of breaking large \nchunks of food into smaller pieces. This increases the total surface area of the food, which is \nimportant because the digestive enzymes  in chemical digestion can only act on the surface \nof food. When the food is in smaller pieces and its surface area is therefore larger, the \ndigestive enzymes are able to gain faster access to the nutrients stored in the food, and this \nspeeds up the overall digestive process.\nFigure  4B\u20133  Box 1 represents a piece of food before mechanical digestion. In boxes 2 \nand 3, mechanical digestion has increased the surface area of the food.1 2 3\nPhysical digestion takes place at various locations along the gastrointestinal tract:\n \u2022in the mouth, when teeth chew the food\n \u2022in the stomach, when the food is churned\n \u2022in the small intestine, when bile produced by the liver breaks down fats (lipids) in the food.\nChemical digestion\nChemical digestion  also occurs at several locations along the gastrointestinal tract. In \nchemical digestion, enzymes break down large complex substances into their simplest \nforms. In this simple form they can pass through cell membranes and be absorbed into the \nbloodstream, where they are transported to cells and used to maintain survival.\nConsider a sandwich that you have eaten for lunch. The bread contains a complex \ncarbohydrate (polysaccharide) known as starch. As you chew the bread, your salivary glands \nrelease an enzyme, called amylase. Amylase breaks down starch into a simpler carbohydrate \n(a disaccharide) known as maltose. Later in the digestive process, maltose is further \nacted on by the enzyme maltase and converted into the simplest type of sugar, glucose (a \nmonosaccharide). The glucose is then absorbed into the bloodstream, distributed to the \ncells and used for cellular respiration.\nCarbohydrates are not the only complex substance broken down through chemical \ndigestion. Proteins are broken down into amino acids, and fats (lipids) are broken down \ninto glycerol and fatty acid chains. All enzymes act on specific substances and operate \nwithin a narrow pH range. This pH range determines the location of each enzyme\u2019s action \nwithin the gastrointestinal tract.Chemical \ndigestion  \nthe process \nof enzymes \nbreaking down \nlarge complex \nsubstances into \ntheir simplest \nforms; occurs \nin several \nplaces along the \ndigestive tractLINK\nPhysical \ndigestion  \nthe process of \nbreaking large \nchunks of food \ninto smaller \npieces\nEnzyme \na biological \ncatalyst that \nspeeds up a \nchemical reaction  \nby lowering \nactivation energy\nLINK UNIT 3\nLINK2D ROLE OF \nCHLOROPLASTS AND \nMITOCHONDRIA2C SURFACE \nAREA TO \nVOLUME RATIO\nLINK1B PLASMA \nMEMBRANEBile \na substance \nproduced by \nthe liver that \nmechanically \ndigests lipids\n175 4B THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM: GETTING THE NUTRIENTS WE NEED\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

This muscle controls the entry \nof food into the stomach as well as preventing the acidic contents of the stomach from \nmoving up into the oesophagus. The arrival of food here triggers the secretion of gastric \njuices, which are made up of pepsin (a type of enzyme that breaks down proteins), water, \nmucus and hydrochloric acid.

It has a large \nnetwork of blood vessels and consists of three sections: duodenum, jejunum and ileum.\nDuodenum\nThe duodenum is approximately 26  cm long and marks the beginning of the small intestine. It \nlies close to the pancreas and receives pancreatic juices from the small intestine and bile from \nthe liver/gall bladder. Chyme passing from the stomach contains hydrochloric acid, which  \nmust be neutralised to prevent damage to the intestinal lining. The bicarbonate in pancreatic \njuice raises the pH to 6, which is not optimal for pepsin, so the pepsin ceases to act.\nBile secreted by the liver is involved in the mechanical breakdown of lipids. Lipids are broken \ndown into tiny droplets in a process known as emulsification. This increases their surface \narea, allowing lipase to carry out the chemical digestion necessary to produce glycerol and \nfatty acids, which can then be absorbed into the blood via the lymphatic system.\nThe chemical breakdown of carbohydrates and proteins also continues through the action \nof amylase and trypsin respectively.\nJejunum\nThe jejunum is the middle part of the small intestine and \nis approximately 2.5  m long. It is mostly responsible for the \nabsorption of nutrients and therefore has a large surface area, \nenhanced by villi (see Specialised cells of the small intestine  \non pages 181\u20132). Amylase by now has broken down large \ncarbohydrates into smaller disaccharides. These are then \nfurther digested by enzymes into simple subunits, such as \nglucose, which can then be absorbed into the bloodstream. \nPepsin and trypsin have broken down proteins into smaller \nchains, known as peptides.

Gluten is a protein \nfound in wheat, rye, barley and oats. When foods containing gluten (such as bread made from wheat) are eaten, the cells of the small intestine become inflamed. If the condition is left untreated, the villi of the small intestine become inflamed and \u2018droopy\u2019. This droopiness reduces the overall surface area of the small intestine, and consequently nutrient absorption also decreases, leading to deficiencies.\nNutrients\nHealthy\nvilli absorb\nnutrients Get into the\nbloodstreamGet into the\nbloodstreamVilli damaged by\ncoeliac diseaseInside the small\nintestineHealthy Coeliac\nFewer nutrients\nget into the\nbloodstream\nFigure 4B\u201313 Comparison of nutrient absorption between a healthy individual and a coeliac sufferer\nCoeliac disease affects approximately 1 in 70 Australians, but about 80% of these remain undiagnosed. Diagnosis is important because, if left untreated, coeliac disease can lead to a variety of poor health outcomes, including osteoporosis, depression, type 1 diabetes and some forms of cancer. Fortunately, treatment involving a lifetime of strict gluten avoidance allows the intestinal villi to heal and the sufferer to live a life of better health.\nHeartburn\nHeartburn  occurs when an uncomfortable burning sensation is felt in your chest, often \naccompanied by a bitter taste in your throat. It is the result of the contents of the stomach coming back up into the oesophagus. If the cardiac sphincter muscle between the oesophagus and stomach becomes weakened, gastric juices containing hydrochloric acid rise into the oesophagus, irritating it in a condition known as reflux.\nHeartburn can be treated easily by taking antacid tablets, which neutralise stomach acid \nand consequently stop the burning sensation. Heartburn is generally no cause for alarm and can be caused by a variety of factors, such as eating spicy foods, too much chocolate, caffeine or alcohol, or lying down after eating. It is also a common condition in pregnancy, because increased production of the hormone progesterone can cause the cardiac sphincter to relax. Persistent episodes of heartburn should, however, be checked by a doctor as it could be symptomatic of a more serious condition, such as a gastric ulcer or a hernia.Heartburn \na burning sensation in the chest caused by stomach acid rising into the oesophagusLINK5C \nHOMEOSTASIS \nGONE WRONG\n184\nCHAPTER 4 FUNCTIONING SYSTEMS \nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

The pancreas is  \nmade up of two types of tissue:\n \u2022exocrine tissue \u2013 responsible for the \nproduction and release of pancreatic \njuice into the duodenum via the \npancreatic duct to aid digestion\n \u2022islets of Langerhans \u2013 endocrine tissue \nresponsible for the production and release  \nof the protein-based hormones insulin \nand glucagon into the bloodstream.\nAs you know, movement of substances \ninto and out of cells relies on concentration \ngradients between the intracellular and \nextracellular environments. Glucose plays a \nkey role in determining these gradients, so \nblood glucose levels must remain balanced for \ncells to function effectively. Two antagonistic \nhormones, insulin and glucagon, are \nresponsible for maintaining blood glucose \nbalance and overall homeostasis. Both \nhormones are produced and released from the \nislets of Langerhans in the pancreas, insulin \nfrom specialised \u2018beta\u2019 cells and glucagon from \nspecialised \u2018alpha\u2019 cells (Figure 4C\u201310).\nFigure  4C\u20139  T-cells attacking a pathogen as part \nof an immune response that involves the hormone \nthymosinPathogen  \na disease-\ncausing agent\n2A THE NATURE \nOF SUBSTANCES \nAND THEIR \nMODES OF \nTRANSPORTLINK UNIT 4\nFigure  4C\u201310  Islets of Langerhans in the \npancreas contain specialised alpha and beta cells. \nThese cells secrete the hormones responsible for \nkeeping blood glucose concentration stable.\nAlpha cell Beta cell\nreleasesPancreas\nreleases\nGlucagon Insulin\nleads to leads to\n   Blood glucose\nincreases  Blood glucose\ndecreasesLINK\nPPS\n195 4C THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM: CHEMICAL CONTROL\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

Unlike the hormones of \nthe thyroid, thymus and pancreas, sex hormones are lipid based and are therefore able to \ndiffuse through the phospholipid bilayer portion of the plasma membrane of target cells \nand bind to complementary receptors in the cytosol.\nThe release of sex hormones from the gonads follows a hierarchical system, much like \nthe release of thyroxine by the thymus gland. Hormones produced by the hypothalamus \nregulate the release of LH and FSH from the anterior pituitary gland, which in turn controls \nthe secretion of testosterone, oestrogen and progesterone from the gonads. Traditionally, \ntestosterone and oestrogen have been considered to be male and female sex hormones \nrespectively. This, however, is not the case, as both hormones are actually produced in both \nsexes. Rather than the type of hormone produced being the difference between the sexes, it \nis the amount of each hormone. Males have approximately seven times more testosterone \nthan females, and females produce significantly more oestrogen than males (Figure 4C\u201311).\nChildhood\nand pubertyHormone level (arbitrary units)Reproduction\nOestrogen males\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\nAge (years)Oestrogen females\nTestosterone femalesPost menopause\nTestosterone males\nFigure  4C\u201311  The levels of sex hormones in humans at different ages\nTestes\nThe testes contain specialised cells, known as leydig cells , that are stimulated by LH \nand FSH from the pituitary gland to produce and secrete testosterone.

Glucose is unable to enter liver, fat and muscle target cells and \ninstead remains in blood circulation. This elevated level of blood glucose is known as \nhyperglycaemia . Diabetes has become an epidemic of the 21st century and is currently \nthe biggest challenge confronting the Australian health system. Currently 1.2 million \nAustralians are diagnosed with diabetes and it is thought that another 500  000 are living \nundiagnosed with the condition. On average, 280 Australians are diagnosed with diabetes \nevery day. That is one person every 5 minutes.\nThere are two main types of diabetes and both arise from i nsulin not effectively carrying \nout its role in lowering blood glucose levels.\nType 1 diabetes\nType 1 diabetes occurs when immune cells attack and destroy the beta cells of the pancreas \nresponsible for producing insulin. The cause of this autoimmune disease is currently \nunknown, and it cannot be cured or prevented. Sufferers of type 1 diabetes must have daily \ninsulin injections to compensate for their body\u2019s inability to produce insulin. The diagnosis \nof type 1 diabetes represents approximately 10% of all diabetes cases.\nType 2 diabetes\nType 2 diabetes currently represents approximately 90% of all diabetes cases and is \nincreasing rapidly. It is a major consequence of Australia\u2019s obesity epidemic, with changes \nin diet and reduced physical activity being the main contributing factors.\nType 2 diabetes is the result of insulin resistance over a long period of time. Insulin \nslowly becomes ineffective at controlling blood glucose levels. To compensate, beta cells \noverproduce insulin, and over time become exhausted. Initially, exercise and a healthy diet \ncan help in the management of type 2 diabetes. Ultimately, however, most sufferers will also \nrequire insulin, like type 1 sufferers.\nBoth types of diabetes are associated with the following symptoms: excessive thirst, increased  \nurination, tiredness and lethargy, weight gain, dizziness/headaches, and constant hunger.\nEarly diagnosis and treatment plans are very effective in helping sufferers live a normal life. \nYou can read more about the malfunction of insulin feedback pathways in Chapter 5.\nGraves\u2019 disease\nGraves\u2019 disease is an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid gland. It was discovered \nin 1835 when Robert J. Graves described it in a patient. It is the result of the thyroid gland \nproducing too much thyroxine, a condition referred to as hyperthyroidism .\nGraves\u2019 disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. A properly functioning \nimmune system involves white blood cells producing a special type of protein, known as \nan antibody . In a healthy individual, the role of antibodies is to destroy harmful invaders, \nbut in Graves\u2019 sufferers, the immune system creates antibodies that mimic the action of \npituitary TSH by binding to TSH receptors on the thyroid. This results in the thyroid \nbeing overstimulated, causing it to grow, overproduce thyroxine and speed up the person\u2019s \nmetabolism. Common symptoms of Graves\u2019 disease are shown in Figure 4C\u201312.Diabetes  \na condition that \nresults from \nan inability to \nmaintain healthy \nblood glucose \nlevels\nLINK5B HOMEOSTASIS \nIN ANIMALS\nHyperthyroidism  \noverproduction \nof thyroxine by \nthe thyroid glandLINK UNIT 4\n198\nCHAPTER 4 FUNCTIONING SYSTEMS \nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

Goitres result from the pituitary gland detecting \nlow blood thyroxine levels and sending more TSH to the thyroid, causing it to enlarge. \nHypothyroidism from infancy causes growth to be stunted.

Contestants were asked to drink as much water as they could without using the toilet. The person who held on for the longest would win a Nintendo Wii, which at the time was highly sought after and nearly impossible to find in the shops. The competition cost 28-year-old Jennifer Strange her life.\nInitially, contestants were required to drink 240\n mL of water every 15 minutes, but this \nescalated as the competition progressed. The competition lasted for about 3 hours and \nit is estimated that, in this time, Jennifer consumed 8 litres of water, which is four times the recommended daily intake. For all her efforts, Jennifer finished in second place and won two concert tickets.On her way home, Jennifer was reportedly crying and complaining of a very painful headache. Later that day, s\nhe was found dead in her home. \nHow is it that water, a substance so vital to life, can also kill?\nThe answer lies within our excretory system. Healthy kidneys are able to excrete \n1\u20131.5 litres of water per hour. If too much water is drunk, the kidneys cannot excrete enough water to maintain homeostasis. Sodium concentrations in the blood drop, and this affects internal concentration gradients. Water intoxication ends with brain cells bursting as water rushes into them via osmosis. Sadly, this is what cost Jennifer Strange her life.\nEXPLAIN\nRemoving toxic by-products\nThe excretory system is primarily responsible for maintaining water balance within an organism. It also plays a major role in the \nexcretion  of waste. The chemical reactions that occur within an \norganism provide the vital ingredients for life. While these reactions produce necessary chemicals such as oxygen and ATP, they also generate toxic by-products that cannot be stored and must be eliminated quickly. For example, carbon dioxide generated by aerobic cellular respiration is transported through the bloodstream to the lungs, where it is breathed out. The other main form of waste is nitrogenous waste (N-waste) created from the breakdown of proteins. It is the role of the excretory system to remove this waste before it becomes toxic to cells.LINK5B \nHOMEOSTASIS \nIN ANIMALS\nLINK 2B OSMOSIS\nLINK2D ROLE OF \nCHLOROPLASTS \nAND \nMITOCHONDRIAExcretion \nthe process of eliminating waste matterVIDEO 4D\u20131 \nTHE EXCRETORY \nSYSTEM\n202\nCHAPTER 4 FUNCTIONING SYSTEMS \nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

The urinary system protects the kidneys from serious infection by preventing \nthe backflow of urine from the bladder to the kidneys. This results in most urinary \ninfections being restricted to the bladder.\nSymptoms of a UTI include:\n \u2022the urge to urinate more frequently but only releasing a few drops\n \u2022a burning pain when urinating\n \u2022cloudy, smelly urine with traces of blood\n \u2022feeling as though the bladder is full, even just after urinating.\nBacteria responsible for UTIs (mainly E. coli ) usually enter the urinary tract through the \nurethra. This is the tube that is connected to your bladder for the excretion of urine. The \nfemale urethra is 4  cm long, while the male urethra is much longer, 20  cm. The short, \nstraight female urethra makes it easier for bacteria to make their way to the bladder, which \nexplains why women are 14 times more likely than men t o experience a UTI.\nWhile UTIs can be uncomfortable, they are not life threatening. The symptoms can be \neased by drinking plenty of water and taking an alkaliniser, which will help neutralise the \nurine and ease the burning sensation when passing urine, until the prescribed antibiotics \nclear the infection.WORKSHEET  4D\u20131  \nTHE EXCRETORY \nSYSTEMDOCLINK 5B HOMEOSTASISMaking urine\nApproximately 200 litres of blood pass through your kidneys each day. If all this was \nexcreted, you would have to drink 4 litres of water every hour to keep your body hydrated. \nLuckily, only 1% of this filtrate becomes urine and is excreted from the body.\nWhen the filtrate reaches the collecting duct as urine, the composition of that urine \ndepends on many variables. For example, a person taking medication or vitamin \nsupplements will pass some of them in their urine. Generally, 95% of urine is water, with \nurea and other substances making up the remaining 5%.\nThe kidneys work closely with the endocrine system to maintain water balance. For \nexample, if an individual is dehydrated as a result of exercise, ADH will be released from \nthe adrenal gland, and will act on target cells in the nephron, increasing the reabsorption \nof water from the tubule into the blood. On the other hand, if a person has drunk a lot \nof water, there is little need for ADH, so less water is reabsorbed and urine forms more \nquickly, increasing the need to urinate. This all contributes to the body\u2019s osmoregulation,  \nmaintaining the balance of water, which is an important homeostatic mechanism.

This section takes a closer look at plant transport systems.\nThe tallest trees in the world are California redwoods ( Sequoia sempervirens ), which grow \non the west  coast of the United States. They reach an average height of 90 metres, with \ntrunks up to 7 metres in diameter. The tallest of them all, named Hyperion, was discovered \nin 2006 and boasts a height of 115.7 metres! Sadly, its location must be kept a closely \nguarded secret, to protect it from vandalism. On average, redwood trees live for 500\u2013700 \nyears, although some have been documented to be more than 2000 years old. The California \nState Park service has attributed the tremendous growth of these trees to the heavy annual \nrainfall and mild year-round temperatures. This makes for the perfect tree-growing climate.\nIn Australia, there is the magnificent mountain ash ( Eucalyptus regnans ). It is the \nsecond-tallest tree species in the world but has the title of \u2018world\u2019s tallest flowering \nplant\u2019. Mountain ash are found only in forests of Victoria and Tasmania,\u00a0and can reach \nheights of up to 140 metres, with a trunk diameter of more than 15\u00a0metres. Currently, \nthe tallest mountain ash, named Centurion, stands at 99.6\u00a0metres tall and is in Tasmania.\nAs you learned in Section 2D, plants convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and \noxygen through photosynthesis.

These types of \nplants make up approximately 90% of the Earth\u2019s \nvegetation and are known as vascular plants . The \nother 10% are non-vascular plants . The classification \nof plants as vascular or non-vascular is the broadest \nlevel of classification in terrestrial (land) plants.\nNon-vascular plants\nAs their name suggests, non-vascular plants lack \nvascular (transport) tissue. This means that they \ndo not have any internal structures capable of \ntransporting water and nutrients. They simply use \nosmosis to transfer substances from cell to cell, and \ndiffusion for the movement of minerals between \ncells. For this reason, non-vascular plants are small in size, because they are restricted in \ntheir ability to transport substances internally. They also lack a root system, which restricts \nthem to moist environments where water is readily available. Examples of non-vascular \nplants are mosses, liverworts, hornworts and some species of algae.\nVascular plants\nThere are more than 260  000 species of vascular plants. They range from grasses to \nflowering plants, ferns to pine trees, shrubs to fruit trees. The California redwood and the \nAustralian mountain ash are examples of vascular plants. Put simply, any land plant that \ntransports water and nutrients through a specialised syst em of tissue is a vascular plant.living organisms, including humans. In aerobic \ncellular respiration, oxygen is consumed and \nglucose is broken down. Both photosynthesis \nand cellular respiration require various \nsubstances to be transported throughout \nthe plant.

  "Page 232": "Transpiration \u2013 through the shoot system\nAs you read this, your heart is hard at work pumping blood down to the tips of your toes \nand up to the top of your head. Plants lack a pump to assist in the transport of substances. \nSo how are they able to provide their leaves with water that originates from the root system, \nsometimes more than 100 metres away? The answer is transpiration .\nTranspiration is the movement of water through a plant from the roots and its evaporation \nthrough the leaves into the atmosphere. The continuous column of water that forms inside \nthe xylem is known as the transpiration stream . Only a very small amount of water in the \ntranspiration stream is used for photosynthesis. \nOver 97% of the water that is absorbed by the \nroots is lost through transpiration. Despite the \nsignificant water loss that transpiration causes, \nit is vital to the plant\u2019s survival because it:\n \u2022transports minerals to leaves, flowers and \nshoot.\n \u2022provides water necessary for photosynthesis \nto the leaves\n \u2022keeps the plant cool and prevents it from \noverheating.\nAll internal spaces within the tissue of a plant \nare coated with water. As this water evaporates \nthrough pores in the leaf, it must be replaced. \nThe loss of water through the leaf creates an \nupward pull or tension force in the column \nof water in the xylem, causing water to be \npulled up through the xylem from the roots \nto the leaves, where it replaces the water that \nevaporates from the leaves, and evaporates in \nits turn. Provided there is soil water available \nto enter the roots by osmosis, this upwards pull on the w ater columns takes over from root \npressure to create the transpiration stream. \nTranspiration is a passive process, requiring no energy from the plant. The ability of a \nplant to generate a continuous water column through the xylem is due to the adhesive and \ncohesive properties of water.\nCohesion and adhesion of water\nWater molecules are polar. This means that the \noxygen end of the water molecule has a slight \nnegative charge and the hydrogen end has a \nslight positive charge. So when water molecules \nare close together, their positive and negative \nends are attracted to the positive and negative \nends of other water molecules, causing them to \nstick together. This sticking together is known \nas cohesion  and is the property that draws \nnearby water from the xylem to replace water \nlost through transpiration.Figure  4E\u201312  A simple overview of transpiration\n3  The water\n    columns\n    are pulled\n    up through\n    plant in the\n    xylem.2  Water is lost by\n    transpiration\n    through stomata,\n    creating a pull on\n    the columns of\n    water in the xylem.\n1  Roots take up water from the soil, creating\n    a small upwards root pressure.\nH\u03b4+\nH\u03b4+H\u03b4+O\u03b4\u2013\nH\u03b4+\nH\u03b4+H\u03b4+ H\u03b4+H\u03b4+\nH\u03b4+H\u03b4+O\u03b4\u2013O\u03b4\u2013\nO\u03b4\u2013O\u03b4\u2013\nFigure  4E\u201313  The attraction between the \npartial positive and negative ends of a water \nmolecule gives water its cohesive property or \n\u2018stickiness\u2019.Transpiration \nstream  \nthe continuous \ncolumn of water \nthat forms \ninside the xylem \nas a result of \nevaporative water \nloss through the \nleaves\nLINK2A THE \nNATURE OF \nSUBSTANCES \nAND THEIR \nMODES OF \nTRANSPORT\n220\nCHAPTER 4 FUNCTIONING SYSTEMS \nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",
  "Page 233": "As well as sticking to itself, water sticks to other surfaces, such as cells of the xylem. This is \nknown as adhesion  and refers to an attraction between two different types of molecules \u2013 in \nthis case, water and xylem walls. If you were to place a thin glass tube (capillary tube) into \nwater, you would notice that the water column rises in the tube. The water that comes into \ndirect contact with the glass extends the highest, and in the middle the water dips at the \nmost distant point from the glass tube. This is the result of the glass molecules being even \nmore polar than the water molecules, and providing the greatest level of attraction.\nStomata\nIf a stick of celery is left in a coloured solution for 30 minutes, the coloured dye moves up \nthe celery stem and into the leaves (Figure 4E\u201314). Even without roots, the coloured dye \nis able to move through the plant. If you were to cut off the leaves of the stick of celery \nand repeat the experiment, you would find that there is no movement of the coloured dye \nthrough the celery stem.\nFigure  4E\u201314  Experiment showing capillary action. Left: Water is drawn \nup through the xylem in the stems, driven by transpiration. The longer the \ncelery is left, the higher up the stem the red dye will be seen. Right: The \nred pigment is visible in a cross-section of the stem.\n \nThis simple experiment highlights the importance of leaves, by showing that the loss of \nwater through transpiration is facilitated by the leaves of the plant. It is also assisted by \nthe stomata. A stoma is composed of two guard cells that control its opening and closing \n(Figure 4E\u201315).\n \u2022When water leaves the guard cells, the stoma closes.\n \u2022When water enters the guard cells, the stoma opens.\nEpidermal cell\nInner thick wall\nOuter thin wall\nVacuoleVacuole\nGuard cells Guard cellsStomatal\npore\nStoma open Stoma closedNucleusChloroplast Chloroplast\nFigure  4E\u201315  Left: When guard cells are turgid, the stoma is open, which allows \nthe exchange of substances (such as water) between the plant and its environment. \nRight: When guard cells are flaccid, they cover the stoma and no exchange can \ntake place.

  "Page 234": "Figure  4E\u201316  A scanning electron micrograph of a closed stoma on the surface of a leafIt is through open stomata in the leaves that water is lost through transpiration. By far the \nbiggest factor affecting the rate of transpiration is the number of open stomata present in \nleaves. The more stomata in leaves, and the more open they are, the greater the surface \narea for water vapour loss to occur. Several other factors that can also affect the rate of \ntranspiration are summarised in Table 4E\u20133.\nTable  4E\u20133  Factors that affect the rate of transpiration\nFactor Effect on \ntranspirationExplanation\nLight \nintensityRate increases  \nas light intensity \nincreasesLight causes stomata to open wider for greater entry of \ncarbon dioxide for photosynthesis, which then allows \ngreater evaporation of water.\nTemperature Rate increases  \nas temperature \nincreasesAs temperature increases, so does the kinetic energy of \nmolecules, which means osmosis and evaporation occur \nfaster.\nWind Rate increases  \nin windy \nconditionsIn windy conditions, water vapour is removed more \nquickly from stomata, which keeps the concentration \ngradient between the leaf and the air high, for faster \nwater evaporation.\nHumidity Rate decreases  \nin humid \nconditionsWhen the air is humid, there is more water vapour \npresent. Humid air is less able to accept water molecules \nby evaporation, which reduces the concentration \ngradient and slows down evaporation.\nIt is important that plants find a way to balance the opening and closing of their stomata. \nOpening stomata allows carbon dioxide into the plant for photosynthesis but it also means \nloss of water through transpiration, which is problematic, particularly on a hot day. Closing \nstomata prevents transpiration and therefore water loss, but it also limits the amount of \nphotosynthesis that can occur. As is often the case, balance is the key to success.LINK2C SURFACE \nAREA TO \nVOLUME \nRATIO\nLINK2D ROLE OF \nCHLOROPLASTS \nAND \nMITOCHONDRIA\nLINK 2B OSMOSIS\nLINK2A THE \nNATURE OF \nSUBSTANCES \nAND THEIR \nMODES OF \nTRANSPORT\n222\nCHAPTER 4 FUNCTIONING SYSTEMS \nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

Not just the actual process of us \nbeing alive, but the fact that we manage to stay alive in an environment where things are \nchanging all the time and we are being constantly challenged. Just think about all of the different \nthings that your body does on a daily basis: eating meals, exercising, being outside in differing \nweather\u00a0conditions.\nAll these things may feel like they have an impact on you. For example, if you go outside without a \njumper and it\u2019s cold, you may feel chilly. However, internally, these things are actually handled \nincredibly well. Indeed, most of the internal workings of the body (in humans and in animals in \ngeneral) are very tightly regulated by a process called homeostasis. In this chapter, you will learn \nabout homeostasis, the processes by which it is maintained and what happens when it goes wrong.\nCurriculum\nArea of Study 2 Outcome 2\nRegulation of systems\nStudy Design Learning intentions \u2013 at the end of this chapter I will be able to:\n\u2022  Regulation of body \ntemperature, blood \nglucose and water balance  \nin animals by  homeostatic \nmechanisms, including \nstimulus\u2013response \nmodels, feedback loops \nand associated organ \nstructures5A   Homeostasis\n5A.1  Recall the five stages of a stimulus\u2013response model\n5A.2 Describe the stimulus\u2013response model\n5A.3  Describe, using diagrams, negative and positive \nfeedback\u00a0loops\n5A.4  Distinguish between examples of negative and positive \nfeedback loops\n5A.5 Define homeostasis\n5A.6  Explain the importance of homeostasis to an \norganism\u2019s\u00a0survivalUNIT  \n1\nCHAPTER  \n5 REGULATION OF SYSTEMSHOW DO ORGANISMS REGULATE THEIR FUNCTIONS?\n232\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

Conversely, if you feel your shirt or a piece of fabric lightly touching the same area of skin, you essentially ignore this stimulus. This behaviour is called \u2018habituation\u2019. Without habituation, living in a complex environment with many unimportant stimuli would be overwhelming. Hypersensitivity to the environment is thought to be common in individuals with autism.\nIn 2014, Mani Ramaswami, a neuroscientist in the School of Genetics and Microbiology \nat Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, proposed a theory for why organisms tend to ignore certain stimuli and therefore not produce a response or action. His model proposed that the \u2018repeated activation of any group of neurons that respond to a given stimulus results in the build-up of \u201cnegative activation\u201d, which inhibits responses from this same group of cells\u2019 (Science Daily).\nThink about all the different things that occur around you every day, and how you \nrespond (or don\u2019t respond) to them. Why do you respond in the way that you do? What happens inside your body that controls these actions?

  "Page 248": "EXPLAIN\nWhat is homeostasis?\nIn Chapter 7, you will read about how plants and animals adapt to changes in their \nenvironment. However, the processes that lead to these developments often take a long time \nto occur, and so they can\u2019t help the organism with the many day-to-day changes that happen \naround it. It is therefore important that the body has mechanisms to be able to handle those \nchanges and maintain a constant internal environment. This process is known as homeostasis .\nThis section explains the mechanisms by which the mammalian body, using the human \nbody as an example, maintains a constant internal environment, and discusses these in \nrelation to three important variables in our body: temperature, blood sugar (glucose) levels \nand water balance.\nStimulus\u2013response model\nImagine you are in the kitchen and you accidentally put your hand down on the hot stove. \nWhat happens? Without even thinking about it, you\u2019ll remove your hand very quickly. This \nis a reflex  action. The body\u2019s process of detecting a change and reacting to it is explained by \nthe stimulus\u2013response model .\nThe stimulus\u2013response model involves two major systems in the body: the nervous system \nand the endocrine system. While there are certainly differences in how these two systems \nact and respond, they also have a number of things in common. Let\u2019s examine these key \nfeatures of the stimulus\u2013response model through an example (Figure 5A\u20131).Homeostasis  \nthe maintenance \nof a constant \ninternal \nenvironment \ndespite changes \nin the external \nenvironment\nReflex  \na response to \na stimulus that \ndoesn\u2019t require \nthought, as the \nnerve signal \ndoes not involve \nthe central \nnervous system\nStimulus\u2013\nresponse model  \nthe pathway \nfrom a stimulus \nor change to \nresponse or \naction taken by \na cell/organism\nStimulus  \na change in \nthe internal \nor external \nenvironment that \ncan be detected\nReceptor  \nspecialised \nproteins or \nglycoproteins in \nthe cytosol or \non the plasma \nmembrane that \nreceive a stimulus\nEffector  \nthe part of \nthe body that \nis capable of \nresponding to a \nstimulus\nResponse  \na change in \nan organism \nresulting from \nthe detection of \na stimulusLINK7C ADAPTATION, \nDIVERSITY AND \nSURVIVAL WITH \nINDIGENOUS \nPERSPECTIVES\nPhone rings\nStimulus Receptor Central nervous\nsystem to effectorResponseRinging is heardAnswer the\nphoneDecide to pick\nup the phone\nFigure  5A\u20131  The key features of the stimulus\u2013response model, using a phone ringing as an example\nThis basic example shows all the key elements of the stimulus\u2013response model. The phone \nringing is the signal that there is something different occurring (a change) that requires a \nreaction \u2013 this is the stimulus . If you are not within earshot of your phone, you won\u2019t hear \nit ringing, so you won\u2019t generate a response. In this case, what is missing is something to \ndetect the stimulus: your ears. The part of the mechanism that is responsible for detecting \na stimulus is the receptor . Next, there needs to be a return signal that generates a response \nto the stimulus. In this instance, it is the decision to get up, or reach over, and pick up the \nphone. The sending of the signal (by the control centre, in this example the central nervous \nsystem) leads to the generation of a response by the effector . Lastly, you do something to \nreact to the stimulus, such as answering the phone so that the ringing stops. This is known \nas the response .\nThis example shows the key concepts of the stimulus\u2013response model. Now let\u2019s look at \nhow they function in the body, particularly while helping to maintain homeostasis.VIDEO 5A\u20131 \nHOMEOSTATIC \nMECHANISMS\n236\nCHAPTER 5 REGULATION OF SYSTEMS\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",
  "Page 249": "Regulation and feedback loops\nIt is important to realise that variables in the body aren\u2019t all kept at a constant level; rather, \nthey are kept within a tight range. The body responds to variations above and below this \nrange \u2013 too high and the level is brought back down, too low and the level is brought \nback up.\nThis is a little like using your phone camera to take a panorama shot (Figure 5A\u20132). While \nyou try and keep the phone steady and as close to the line as possible, the reality is that often \nyou go a little bit above it, and then try and adjust, but you go a little bit below it. However, as \nlong as the movement away from the line isn\u2019t too great, the photo still turns out well.\nNegative \nfeedback loop  \na process that \nregulates a \nvariable within \nan organism, \nwhereby the \nlast step in \nthe process \n(response) \nreduces the \ninitial stimulus \nand so is \nself-limitingSTIMULUS\nThere is a shift away from normal levels (e.g. an increase or decrease)\nRECEPTOR/SENSOR\nThe stimulus is detected\nCONTROL CENTRE\nThe message from the sensors is received in the brain\nEFFECT\nThe brain sends out a message (to the effector) to oppose the stimulusSTOP\nRESPONSE\nThe action that\nopposes the\nstimulus and\nreturns levels\nback to normal\nFigure  5A\u20133  A generalised pathway for a negative feedback loop.

One of the \nmain ways in which the body maintains homeostasis is through negative feedback loops . \nAll negative feedback loops have five main stages, as shown in the flow chart in Figure 5A\u20133.\nPPS\n237\n5A HOMEOSTASIS\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",
  "Page 250": "To help you remember the steps involved in a negative feedback loop, use the acronym \nSTRICTER (Stimulus To Receptor, Input to Control, Then Effect and Response). The important thing to remember here is that the effect that is generated has a direct impact on opposing the stimulus. This means that once normal levels have been restored in the body, the stimulus is no longer present, and the loop will stop.\nBiological examples of negative feedback will be given in the next section. Meanwhile, \nanother way to picture this process is through a non-biological example: the heater in your house. When you turn it on, you set it to a certain temperature. If the temperature of the room is below that value, the heater turns on to warm up the room. Once the room warms to the appropriate temperature, a thermostat or sensor in the heater detects this and causes it to turn off. Over time, with the heater off, the room will cool down again and the process will begin again. The effect of this is that the room temperature is kept fairly constant, or at least within a narrow range, at all times.\nPositive feedback\nIt is important to recognise that feedback loops exist that also generate responses that increase the initial stimulus. These are known as \npositive feedback loops . One of the best \nknown examples of a positive feedback loop occurs during childbirth (Figure 5A\u20134) and is responsible for the contractions that help deliver the baby. In this situation, the initial stimulus is provided by the baby pushing against the cervix, triggering stretch receptors in the uterus. This signal travels to the brain, which generates an effect through the release of the hormone oxytocin. Oxytocin causes the uterine muscles to contract. As the muscles contract, the space in the uterus gets smaller around the baby, which causes the stretch receptors to be triggered, and the whole process to restart. As you can see, this is the opposite of a negative feedback loop. In these situations, instead of opposing the initial stimulus, the end product of the loop initiates the stimulus and repeats the cycle.Positive \nfeedback loop \na process that controls a variable within an organism, whereby the last step in the process causes the action to be repeated\nEventually the contractions\ncause the baby to be delivered\nBaby pushes against cervix\n(opening between uterus\nand vagina)Stretch receptors\nsend signals to brainBrain signals pituitary\ngland to release oxytocinControl centre\nReceptor\nResponse\nStimulus ResponsePositive\nfeedback\nUterine muscles contract\nin response to oxytocinEffector\nFigure 5A\u20134 The positive feedback loop that occurs with oxytocin inducing contractions during childbirth. \nThe process goes around the loop numerous times until the baby is delivered.LINK4C THE \nENDOCRINE \nSYSTEM: \nCHEMICAL \nCONTROL\nPPS\n238\nCHAPTER 5 REGULATION OF SYSTEMS\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

This narrow range  \nis the same in humans.\nAn exception to this is when you have a fever. This occurs when the body becomes infected \nwith a foreign pathogen, such as a bacteria or virus. Many people assume that this elevated \ntemperature is due to the bacteria or virus. However, it is actually  part of the body\u2019s defence \nmechanism. At slightly higher temperatures, enzymes within the immune system work \nmore effectively. Also, at higher temperatures, the body is a less suitable environment for \nreplication of invading pathogens. These effects help to clear the infection. \nHowever, even this onset of fever needs to be tightly regulated by the body. During fever, \nthe blood and urine volumes decrease as a result of loss of water through increased \nsweating. In addition, proteins are rapidly broken down, leading to increased excretion \nof nitrogenous waste in the urine. \nSevere fevers, where the body temperature can rise to 42\u00b0C or more, can result in \ncontinuous convulsions, serious brain damage and even death.\nFigure  5B\u20131  Sweating or shivering is \npart of a feedback loop designed to \nrestore normal body temperature.EXPLAIN\nRegulation of body temperature\nBody temperature is one of the variables in the \nhuman body that we notice the most. Walk outside \nin the middle of winter not wearing enough layers, \nand your body starts to feel cold, and you shiver. Go \nfor a run in the middle of summer and you end up \ndrenched in sweat. Why do these things happen? As \nyou probably realise by now, most things in biology \naren\u2019t accidental \u2013 they have a role and a purpose.\nOur normal body temperature is maintained at \nabout 37.5\u00b0C (with one exception, which is discussed \nabove).

  "Page 254": "The first step in the regulation of body temperature is that any change \u2013 an increase \nor decrease in body temperature \u2013 is registered. This happens via sensors , in this case \nthermoreceptors within the skin. These sensors are not capable of creating a response \nthemselves. The message first needs to be transmitted to the control centre. In the \ncase of temperature regulation, the control centre is a part of the brain known as the \nhypothalamus. The hypothalamus then sends signals to various parts of the body to \ngenerate the necessary response.\nA very simple model of the feedback loops and responses involved in temperature \nregulation in the body is shown in Figure 5B\u20132. As body temperature decreases, a response \n(such as shivering) is generated that results in the normal temperature being restored. If \nbody temperature rises, the higher temperature activates cooling mechanisms (such as \nsweating) that reduces the temperature to the normal range.\nAs you can see in Figure 5B\u20132, one of the key mechanisms that controls the regulation of \nbody temperature is dilation (widening) or constriction (narrowing) of blood vessels. These \nare referred to as vasodilation and vasoconstriction respectively, as \u2018vaso\u2019 is a term that \nrelates specifically to vessels (usually blood vessels).\nThe regulation of body temperature in other mammals is similar to humans but with some \ndifferences, such as panting or licking the fur, rather than perspiring to cool down.

It is one of our primary \nsources of energy, as the body converts it into ATP during cellular respiration. It is not \nsurprising, then, that glucose levels in the body must be very tightly regulated. In this \ninstance, homeostasis is maintained through two hormones: insulin and glucagon. The two \nhormones are produced by the pancreas, and have opposing effects.\nYou may have learned about the pancreas in Section 4C (depending on the body system \nchosen). If not, you can turn back to that section of this book and read up on the details. \nLet\u2019s revisit some of the major points.\nThe structure of the pancreas is shown in Figure 5B\u20134 on the following page.Birds do not sweat or pant like dogs, but may flutter their throat membranes to do the same \nkind of thing. Birds and mammals also have different kinds of behavioural adaptations from \nhumans to help regulate body temperature, with the aim of seeking out cold or warm places \nas required.\nIn order to understand how vasodilation and vasoconstriction work, it is useful to look at \nthe structure of the major blood vessels \u2013 arteries and veins. These structures can be seen \nin Figure 5B\u20133. As you can see in this figure, the vessels contain elastic and muscular layers, \nwhich allow for the stretching movements described above. By contracting, as happens \nwhen the body temperature is too low, the blood vessels move further away from the \nsurface of the skin, and so less heat is lost to the surroundings. In the opposite way, dilation \nof blood vessels (through relaxation of the elastic layers) moves the vessels closer to the skin \nsurface and more heat is lost, thus cooling down the body.\nLINK4C THE \nENDOCRINE \nSYSTEM: \nCHEMICAL \nCONTROLLINK2D ROLE OF \nCHLOROPLASTS \nAND \nMITOCHONDRIA\n243 5B HOMEOSTASIS IN ANIMALS AND PLANTS\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

In Section 5C, you will learn about \ntype 1 diabetes, a condition that results from the body not being able to maintain blood \nglucose homeostasis.\nRegulation of water balance in mammals\nMaintaining water balance, a process known as osmoregulation , is critical for many processes in \nthe body. It is essential for normal cell function, as well as healthy blood pressure and heart rate.\nTo maintain a factor within a constant range during homeostasis requires a receptor \nto detect when a change occurs. For water balance, these receptors are known as \nosmoreceptors  and are located within the hypothalamus. If these receptors detect a change, \nsuch as a decrease in the water balance, they must generate a response that will reverse this \nchange and restore homeostasis. The response comes in the form of a hormone known \nas antidiuretic  hormone  (ADH), which is released into the bloodstream and transported \nthroughout the body. \u2018Antidiuretic\u2019 means reducing urination. When the water balance in \nthe body decreases, the body\u2019s response is to absorb and reabsorb more water and excrete \nless in the urine \u2013 this is the function of ADH.\nSo how exactly does ADH lead to the absorption of more water? The answer lies in the \nstructure of the kidney, covered in Section 4D. However, let\u2019s revisit some of the major points. \nThe main structural features of the kidney can be seen in Figure 5B\u20136 below.\nAs you can see, we are focusing on the part of the kidney known as the nephron. The nephron \nhas three main functions: filtration, secretion and reabsorption (which is crucial in maintaining \nwater balance). In situations where the water balance is low, ADH acts on target cells in the \nnephron, triggering them to increase their reabsorption and thus maintain homeostasis.Osmoreceptors  \nsensors in the \nbody that detect \nchanges in \nwater balance \naway from \nhomeostatic \nlevels\nLINK4D THE \nEXCRETORY \nSYSTEM: \nELIMINATING \nWASTE\nFigure  5B\u20136  Nephron structure relating to the \naction of ADH in regulating reabsorption of water \nand thus water balance in the body.

  "Page 258": "With your knowledge of negative feedback loops, can you predict what would happen when \nthe water balance is restored? To answer this, apply the steps of the feedback loop.\nThe osmoreceptors will stop detecting a change, and so the response (ADH release) will \nalso stop. This means that ADH won\u2019t trigger cells in the nephron to increase reabsorption, \nand so more water will be excreted in urine. Eventually, if this water balance drops again, \nthe process will restart.\nYou may also wish to revisit Section 4D, to revise the excretory system and the organs \ninvolved, to try and work out where and how ADH increases the absorption of water back \ninto the body.\nRegulation of water balance in plants\nPlants rely on water for photosynthesis and survival. It is not common to relate water \nregulation in vascular plants through a model of negative feedback. However, as shown in \nFigure 4E\u201315, plants respond to a shortage of water by closing their stomata to stop water \nloss through transpiration. When water is available again to the roots the stomata will open \nagain to restart transpiration. This has some features of a negative feedback loop. \nAs the stomata are also the point of gas exchange by diffusion (carbon dioxide in, oxygen out) \nrequired for photosynthesis, closing them has a significant impact on the plant\u2019s ability to take \nin carbon dioxide, stopping photosynthesis. Additionally, as you will recall from Section 4E, \nthe movement of water through the xylem via transpiration is needed to both cool the plant \nand provide minerals and ions to the leaves. This also stops when stomata close.\nIn mammals with an active circulation system, the importance of osmoreceptors in \nreversing a change in water balance and restoring homeostasis was outlined. In plants, this \nreversal is not as simple. Plants cannot just release a hormone that results in the absorbance \nand re-absorbance of water from other parts or systems as easily as animals can. If the \nplant is not adapted to long dry periods, it will wilt and die. This is why plants are typically \nnot thought of as having a direct negative feedback homeostatic mechanism of controlling \nwater concentration.\nHowever, guard cells which surround the stomata, like almost all cells in the plant, are \ncapable of producing a plant hormone called abscisic acid under conditions of water stress, \nwhich results in the stomata closing. Although not fully understood to date, guard cells \nhave receptors for abscisic acid on their plasma membrane and when the abscisic acid \nhormone binds to them, it stimulates potassium ions being pumped out of the cell. As you \nwill recall from the process of osmosis, the results in a higher free water concentration \ninside the cell, meaning that water leaves the cell. The result is that the guard cells \nsurrounding the stomata become flaccid and the stomata close, preventing excessive water \nloss from the plant.\nSection 4E also describes the role of root hair cells in taking up soil water by osmosis but \nthis is not an actively-regulated process. Stomata controlling transpiration is the primary \nmeans of water regulation in plants.LINK7C ADAPTATION, \nDIVERSITY AND \nSURVIVAL, WITH \nINDIGENOUS \nPERSPECTIVES\nCheck-in questions \u2013 Set 1\n1 Referring to Section 4C, what is the term for a hormone that has an effect on cells \nthroughout the body?\n2 Referring to Section 4C, the cells of what organ are likely to be targeted by ADH?LINK4D THE \nEXCRETORY \nSYSTEM: \nELIMINATING \nWASTE\nLINK2D ROLE OF \nCHLOROPLASTS \nAND \nMITOCHONDRIA\nLINK4E PLANT \nSYSTEMSLINK4E PLANT \nSYSTEMS\nLINK 2B OSMOSIS\nWORKSHEET 5B\u20131  \nDIAGRAMS OF \nHOMEOSTATIC \nREGULATIONDOC\n246\nCHAPTER 5 REGULATION OF SYSTEMS\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

In that section, the STRICTER approach was used to explain the steps involved \nin negative feedback loops. In this section, a number of physiological examples of \nnegative feedback loops were discussed: regulation of body temperature, regulation of \nblood glucose levels and regulation of water balance. All these processes involve the \nsame general steps associated with negative feedback loops, and so the STRICTER \napproach is still valid.\nHowever, when answering a question that has a specific context (e.g. regulation of blood \nglucose levels), it is important that your response includes information relevant to \nthat specific situation, not just generic information about the underlying process. Let\u2019s \nexamine this by seeing the best way to answer the following question.\nQuestion : Using your knowledge of feedback loops, discuss how the body regulates a \nhigh blood glucose level.\nFor this question, two responses are shown below, for each step of the STRICTER \napproach. The red text indicates a response that is too broad. The green text is the most \nappropriate answer because it includes information that is relevant to the context of blood \nglucose levels.\nAnswer :\nS (stimulus): There is a stimulus where something is outside the appropriate \nhomeostatic range.\nS (stimulus): Blood glucose levels increase beyond the normal homeostatic range, \nsuch as after eating a meal.\nTR (to receptor): The receptor detects this stimulus.\nTR (to receptor): Beta cells in the pancreas contain receptors (target cells) that detect \nthe increased blood glucose level.\nIC (input to control): The control centre responds to the detected stimulus and \ncoordinates a response.\nIC (input to control): The beta cells promote the expression and synthesis of insulin.\nTE (then effect): An action is taken to oppose the stimulus.\nTE (then effect): Insulin is released via exocytosis by the beta cells to promote the \nuptake of glucose by cells, particularly muscle and liver.\nR (response): The stimulus reverts back to homeostatic levels.\nR (response): The blood glucose levels decrease back to within the normal \nhomeostatic range. Hence, this is an example of a negative feedback loop.\nAs you can see, the red answers aren\u2019t wrong \u2013 they correctly describe what is happening \nat each step, in terms of a generic negative feedback loop. However, they are not specific \nenough to address the issue of blood glucose homeostasis.

When there is a concern that an individual may have \ndeveloped diabetes, they undergo a test known as the \u2018glucose tolerance test\u2019. In this test, \nthe individual  fasts (no food for a specified period before the \ntest) and then they are given a large amount of glucose to \ningest. Their blood glucose levels are then measured using \na drop of blood from the finger at various times for 2 hours. \nThe pattern of change in blood glucose levels that occurs in \na person with diabetes compared with a healthy individual \nis shown in Figure 5C\u20132.\nIn T1D, both the fasting levels and the levels after taking \nthe glucose solution are elevated. More importantly, there \nis a big difference in the response over time between \nhealthy individuals and those with T1D. While the blood \nglucose levels spike (rise quickly) in healthy individuals \nafter taking the solution (time = 0 minutes), over time the \nglucose in the blood is brought back down to original levels. \nThis is homeostasis being maintained through a correctly \nfunctioning negative feedback loop.

In healthy individuals, blood glucose levels are regulated \nthrough two negative feedback loops. These feedback loops are illustrated below:\nIt can be seen that these feedback loops are under the control of two hormones: \ninsulin is responsible for lowering blood glucose levels when they get too high, and \nglucagon has the opposite effect (e.g. raising blood glucose levels when they get too \nlow). In type 1 diabetes, the beta cells in the pancreas, which are responsible for \nproducing insulin, are destroyed. This results in a lack of insulin production in the \nbody. Looking at the diagram again, we can see that this would result in the body \nnot being able to respond properly when a stimulus of \u2018high blood glucose levels\u2019 \nis received. This explains why people with type 1 diabetes are unable to properly \nregulate their blood glucose levels and require insulin injections to do so artificially.\nThe end-of-section questions will provide you with more opportunities to work on \nstructuring your responses to address different contexts.Type 1 diabetes\n\u03b2 cells\nrelease insulinBlood\nglucose \u2193\nNormal blood\nglucose level\nBlood\nglucose \u2193Blood\nglucose \u2191Normal blood\nglucose level\n\u03b1 cells release\nglucagonCells in liver convert\nglycogen to glucoseBlood\nglucose \u2191Cells increase uptake\nof glucose from blood\n255 5C HOMEOSTASIS GONE WRONG\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

The need for a printed \nlogbook, rather than an online or digital \nlogbook, removes the likelihood of any tampering with results. Of course, this will depend \non your school and your teacher\u2019s authentication practices, so it is best to work within your \nschool\u2019s guidelines.\nIn this section, you will learn how to develop a logbook for your own practical investigation \nand the importance of each section in contributing to the end product. This is usually in \nthe form of a scientific poster (outlined in Section 6C). Other forms of representing results \ninclude oral, multimedia or visual presentation, and these are discussed in more detail in \nthe digital resource that accompanies this textbook.\nAn important function of an effective logbook is that it clearly demonstrates the \ndevelopment of the ideas that come from your research and investigation, including \nchanges in direction, equipment failures and so on, as well as your collaboration and \ndiscussion with peers.

  "Page 277": "Introduction In the introduction (to \na poster) it can also be \nappropriate to present \na labelled diagram of \nthe concept/idea being \ninvestigated.1 Enzymes are essential to help reactions proceed more efficiently, in \norder to sustain life. They are made of proteins, which are coded for \nby an organism \u2019s DNA, and they are specific to the substance they \nact on.\n2 The enzyme catalase reacts with the substrate hydrogen peroxide \n(H2O2), breaking it down into water and oxygen (products) in a \ncatabolic reaction. Catalase is primarily found in the liver and is \nimportant in protecting the organism from damage caused by \nhydrogen peroxide, which is constantly produced by mammals.\nThe rate of reaction between an enzyme and the substrate can \nbe affected by many things, such as concentration of enzyme \nand substrate, pH level and inhibitors. It can also be affected by \ntemperature. Every enzyme has an optimal temperature, at which \nits rate of reaction is highest with the most successful collisions \nwith the substrate. The general rule for this is that, as temperature \nincreases, the rate of reaction increases until optimal temperature \nis reached. Any further increase in temperature will result in a \ndramatic drop in rate of reaction and may lead to denaturation of \nthe enzyme. Denaturation is an irreversible process caused by the \nhydrogen bonds being broken, destroying the characteristic 3D \nstructure of the protein and therefore changing its active site so it \ncannot bind to the substrate.\nThe normal functioning temperature for a human is 37 \u00b0C, which is \nsimilar to that of a lamb, where the liver containing catalase was \nobtained from. If the temperature decreases in the lamb, then there is \nless kinetic energy and therefore fewer successful collisions between \nthe enzyme and substrate, leaving the lamb vulnerable to damage \noccurring from the peroxide. Similarly, if the temperature increases to \na certain point, the enzyme denatures again, leaving it vulnerable.\nAim The aim includes \nexplicit reference to \nthe independent and \ndependent variable. \nThis will be included \nin your introduction \nfor the final scientific \nposter presentation.1 To determine the temperature at which catalase functions most \nefficiently.\n2 To determine the optimal temperature for the enzyme catalase, by \nmeasuring the height of bubbles (oxygen gas) produced during the \nbreakdown of the substrate hydrogen peroxide. \nHypothesis The hypothesis is a \nprediction of what \nyou think will occur. \nIt does not have \nto be correct, but \nshould be supported \nby knowledge of the \ntheory, which is the \ndifference between \ninvestigations 1 and 2.1 That the catalase will function best at 37 \u00b0C.\n2 That as the temperature to which the lamb liver is exposed \nincreases, so too will the rate of reaction, producing a greater \nheight of oxygen bubbles until the optimal temperature of 37 \u00b0C \n(normal temperature of a live lamb) is reached. Any further increase \nin temperature will lower the rate of reaction due to the 3D \nconformational shape of the catalase denaturing.Introduction  \na detailed \nbut succinct \nexplanation of \nthe reason for \nundertaking an \ninvestigation; \nincludes key \nbiological concepts, \naim and hypothesis\nLINKLINK2D ROLE OF \nCHLOROPLASTS \nAND \nMITOCHONDRIA\n4B THE DIGESTIVE \nSYSTEM: GETTING \nTHE NUTRIENTS \nWE NEED\nAim \nthe main purpose of \nan investigation and \nwhat you hope to \nachieve\nHypothesis  \na prediction of \nthe outcomes, \nwhich are testable \nexperimentally and \nform the basis of \nthe methodology\n265 6A INVESTIGATIVE  DESIGN\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

As the results \nare always out by \na consistent value, \nthey will always be \ninaccurate. Therefore, \na change in the \nmethod or equipment \nmust occur.1 Each time the liver was transferred from the water bath to the set-\nup, its temperature changed, which could have affected the results.\n2 For liver that was initially kept at temperatures below room \ntemperature (0, 10 and 20 \u00b0C), transferring it from the water bath \nto the conical flask resulted in a slight increase in temperature. \nAdditionally, the way the experiment was set up meant that the \noxygen produced from the reaction needed to travel from the conical \nflask through the tubing and into the test tube. This would not be \nan accurate representation of all the oxygen causing bubbles to be \nformed, as some of the oxygen each time would remain in the conical \nflask, thereby affecting the results for the investigation at each \ntemperature.\nRandom errors The effect of a \nrandom error can be \nreduced by repeating \nmeasurements, \nhaving a larger sample \nsize and/or taking a \nmean. As results are \nequally likely to be \nhigh or low, averaging \ncan improve the \nprecision of results. \nFor most experiments \nin a laboratory where \nmultiple trials are \nconducted, you will \nneed to account for \nthe effect of these on \nyour investigation. \nYou may need to \nalso account for \noutliers  by repeating \nmeasurements.1 There were no random errors because the experiment was only \nconducted once.\n2 Random errors were present in this experiment, as it is clear that \nthere are differences in measurements between the three trials \nat each temperature.

If you cannot repeat \nthe experiment, then your report should include a discussion of flaws in the design or method, \nand suggestions for how the investigation could be altered to minimise or eliminate these.\nConclusion\nThe main purpose of the conclusion  is to briefly summarise the position of the experiment \nin the wider understanding of the biological topic(s). You need to state the important overall \ntrend of the data (referring specifically to data from your results) and whether or not the \nresults support the tested hypothesis. The conclusion should also assess whether the results \nof the experiment have contributed new information to what is known about the topic, and \nany further investigations that need to be undertaken. The conclusion should not introduce \nany information that has not already been discussed in the results and discussion section.\nFor example, in the experiment described in this chapter, the conclusion might read \nlike this:\nIn conclusion, the results indicate that the optimal temperature of the catalase enzyme in \nlamb liver is 40 \u00b0C as shown by the highest mean height of oxygen bubbles produced,  \n18.7 mm. This is compared to the predicted optimal temperature of 37 \u00b0C, which produced an \noxygen bubble height of only 16.5 mm. As such, the results do not support the hypothesis. \nHowever, whether this was completely true should be further explored by conducting the \ninvestigation at smaller increments of temperature, to find the exact optimal temperature .\n274\nCHAPTER 6 SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

You would have written up your planning stages and presented your \nresults in a typical scientific report. While this is still done even at university, would \nyou want to read a scientist\u2019s research presented to you in this way? Probably not. So \nscientists often communicate their findings in the form of a scientific poster. In the past \nfew decades, posters have become a popular way to showcase new investigations and \nfindings to the scientific community, nationally and internationally.\nProducing a scientific poster is a skill and is not easy. It often requires a lot of thought \nand preparation, as well as the ability to keep your ideas concise.\nEXPLAIN\nScientific poster template\nA key part of the School Assessed Coursework (SACs) in Units 3 & 4 Biology is a self-\ndesigned practical investigation presented in the format of a poster, using the following \ntemplate:LINK UNITS 3&4\nThis template is the same as the one provided in the VCAA Study Design. You\u2019ll notice \nfrom the template that the heading of each section correlates closely with the information \nthat is recorded in your logbook from Sections 6A and 6B. This should therefore highlight \nthe importance of the progression of information that is recorded there, as it will need to \nbe transferred in a more succinct fashion onto your poster. The VCAA has also stipulated \nthat this should not exceed 600 words. The centre of the poster occupies approximately \none-quarter of the page and needs to be one sentence summarising the main outcomes \nof your investigation, thereby answering your investigation question (title). This should \nbe as engaging as possible, to encourage any reader to want to read the other sections of \nyour poster.Title\nStudent name\nIntroduction\nMethodology and methods\nResultsCommunication statement \nreporting the key finding  \nof the investigation as a  \none-sentence summaryDiscussion\n \n \nConclusion\nReferences and acknowledgements\nLINK6A INVESTIGATIVE \nDESIGN\n6B SCIENTIFIC \nEVIDENCELINKVIDEO 6C\u20131 \nSCIENTIFIC \nPOSTER \nEXAMPLE\n280\nCHAPTER 6 SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",
  "Page 293": "You might be wondering where the aim and hypothesis from your logbook should be \nincluded on the poster. They are included in the introduction, following a brief explanation \nof the reasons for conducting your investigation, and link to the relevant biological \nconcepts.\nThe poster can be produced either electronically or in hard copy format and may even be \ndone in a different structure to this in Units 1&2. It will of course depend on what your \nschool chooses as the preferred format, and you should therefore follow this.\nPurpose of the scientific poster\nThe scientific poster\u2019s main goal is to get your message, the findings of your investigation, \nacross to everyone. It is designed not just for those with a scientific understanding of the \ninvestigation conducted, but those with a non-scientific background as well. The reason for \nsetting it out in the template proposed on the previous page is for maximum impact and \nvisual appeal. There are no large blocks of text that are not inviting to read. It is organised \ninto columns, to help your readers follow the information. Including a table of results and a \ngraph breaks up the text and avoids large blank areas. Lastly, the limitation on word count \nis so that the text is clear and concise. Your investigation should therefore be explicit and \nnot too broad or overly complicated, so the results can be explained concisely.\nIn the poster, you should also include the sources of information (references) that \nyou used when planning and conducting the investigation. You can also acknowledge \nthose who supported your investigation, such as peers, your teacher or others. How to \ncorrectly complete references is explored in Chapter 9 (Unit 2, Area of Study 3, Research \nInvestigation).\nOther methods for presenting an investigation\nIn addition to presenting your results in the form of a poster, you should be able to \ndiscuss your investigation with your peers, teacher, family or anyone from a non-scientific \nbackground. Most of those in the scientific community prefer to have individual discussions \nwith other experimenters about their work, rather than reading it from a poster. Talking \nabout their work with others also gives the experimenter a chance to discuss aspects of \ntheir investigation that have not been included in the final presentation, and to answer any \nfollow-up questions.\nTherefore, other methods for presenting the purpose and results of your investigation \ninclude: oral presentation, multimedia presentation, visual representation or even an \narticle for a scientific publication. Tips and suggestions for these are included in the digital \nresource, in the form of downloadable documents on preparing an article for scientific \npublication, and preparing an oral, multimedia or visual presentation.\nSection 6C questions\n1  Where should you draw information from to complete your scientific poster?\n2  What is included in the introduction section of the scientific poster?\n3  What are the key sections of a scientific poster?\n4  What is the purpose of the communicating statement in the centre of the poster?\n5  What are some other ways of presenting the results of an investigation in Biology, and in \ngeneral to the scientific community?\nLINK CHAPTER 9\nWORKSHEET 6C\u20131  \nPREPARING AN \nARTICLE FOR \nSCIENTIFIC \nPUBLICATIONDOC\nWORKSHEET 6C\u20132  \nPREPARING AN \nORAL, MULTIMEDIA \nOR VISUAL \nPRESENTATIONDOC\n281 6C SCIENTIFIC  COM MUNICATION\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

Offspring produced \nin this way are genetically identical to that parent, as they receive all the parent\u2019s genetic \ninformation. These offspring can be called clones  of the parent.\nAs only one parent is needed to produce the offspring, special types of cell division are \nrequired. Prokaryotes that reproduce asexually use binary fission to create more cells, while \neukaryotes that reproduce asexually use mitosis. You may recall that these processes were \ncovered in detail in Section 3B.\nAsexual reproduction generally occurs more often in primitive organisms; however, it can \noccur in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, unicellular and multicellular organisms, fungi, \nplants and animals.LINK3B THE \nCELL CYCLEAsexual \nreproduction  \na type of \nreproduction in \nwhich only one \nparent is required \nto produce \noffspring, which \nare genetically \nidentical to the \nparent\nClone  \nan organism \nor a cell that \nis identical to \nanother organism \nor cell\nVIDEO 7A\u20131 \nASEXUAL \nREPRODUCTION\n300\nCHAPTER 7 REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGIES, ADAPTATIONS AND DIVERSITY\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",
  "Page 313": "Types of naturally occurring asexual reproduction\nThere are many types of asexual reproduction, and the method used varies between species.\nFission\nSome organisms that reproduce by fission  are:\n \u2022unicellular prokaryotes, such as bacteria\n \u2022unicellular eukaryotes, such as the protozoans Amoeba  and Euglena , single-celled algae, \nsome sea anemones and some coral polyps.\nRecall from Section 3B that prokaryotes \nproduce new cells by binary fission, \nwhile eukaryotes produce new cells by \nmitosis. Binary fission and mitosis are \nboth examples of fission. In fission, the \nparent cell splits into two, producing \ntwo genetically identical cells, called \ndaughter cells.\n \u2022 Bacteria  are prokaryotes \u2013 they have \na single circular chromosome and no \nmembrane-bound organelles. During \nfission, the DNA attaches to the cell \nmembrane and replicates. The cell \nthen elongates, pinches into two and \nforms two genetically identical cells.\n \u2022 Eukaryotes , such as protozoa, have a \nmembrane-bound nucleus and so the \nprocess of fission takes longer and is \nmore complex than in bacteria. After \nDNA replication and mitosis, the \ncytoplasm divides by cytokinesis, and \nthis gives the cell time to grow before \nit can form two daughter cells again.\nFragmentation\n Fragmentation  occurs in multicellular \norganisms, including:\n \u2022many plants (called vegetative \npropagation )\n \u2022some animals, such as coral, sponges, \nechinoderms (sea stars, sea urchins), \nannelids (segmented worms) and \nflat worms.\nFragmentation is similar to fission in that the parent cell/organism splits (see \nFigure 7A\u20134 on the following page). However, fragmentation occurs only in \nmulticellular organisms, and the daughter cells/organisms are not necessarily all \nthe same size. When a parent cell/organism breaks into t wo or more fragments, \neach fragment regenerates the missing section and two or more daughter cells/\norganisms are formed. This may happen naturally, as is the case with sponges and Fission  \na type of naturally \noccurring asexual \nreproduction in \nwhich the parent \ncell splits, forming \ntwo genetically \nidentical cells\nLINK1C CELL TYPES\n3B THE  CELL \nCYCLE\nFigure  7A\u20132  An Escherichia coli (E. coli)  bacterium in \nthe early stages of binary fission\nParent Paramecium\nParent Paramecium \nstarting to split into twoTwo daughter \nParamecium \nalmost \nseparated\nFigure  7A\u20133 The protozoan Paramecium  undergoing fission\nFragmentation  \na type of naturally occurring \nasexual reproduction in which \nthe parent breaks into two \nor more fragments and each \nfragment then regenerates to \nform a new daughter organism\n301 7A ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

Examples of different \ntypes of naturally occurring vegetative propagation are given in Table 7A\u20131.\nTable  7A\u20131  Types of vegetative propagation\nType Description\nTuber\n A tuber is a swollen underground stem that can give rise to \nnew daughter plants that arise from buds. The point where \nthe bud germinates from the tuber is called the \u2018eye\u2019 of the \ntuber. The tuber itself is then used as a food supply during \nthe growth of the new plant.\nExample: potatoes\nRhizome\n A rhizome is a horizontal underground stem from which \nnew buds shoot up through the surface of the soil and \nproduce new daughter plants.\nExamples: bamboo, ginger\nStolon\n Also known as runners, stolons are horizontal above-\nground stems that grow out of the parent plant. At various \nintervals, the runners give rise to plantlets with roots that \ncan become a whole new plant. Once the new plants are \nestablished, the runners die.\nExample: strawberries\nPlantlet\n As well as growing from stolons, young plants (known as \nplantlets) can grow from a leaf surface and then drop to \nthe ground. If they land on fertile ground, they will grow \ninto new plants.\nExamples: piggyback plant, mother of thousands\nBulb\n A bulb is a short underground stem surrounded by many \nclosely packed, fleshy leaves, called scales (food storage). \nEach bulb grows into a new plant.\nExamples: daffodils, tulips, onions\nSucker A sucker, also called a root sprout, is a new shoot that \narises from a bud on the underground root of the parent \nplant, which extends some distance from the parent plant.\nExample: blackberriesVegetative \npropagation  \nanother name \nfor asexual \nreproduction \nin plants; can \noccur both \nnaturally and \nartificially; also \ncalled vegetative \nreproduction\n304\nCHAPTER 7 REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGIES, ADAPTATIONS AND DIVERSITY\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

  "Page 318": "Types of artificial asexual reproduction\nDefining artificial cloning\nYou know that asexual reproduction results in offspring that are genetically identical to \ntheir parents \u2013 they are clones of the parents. The process of making clones by asexual \nreproduction can also occur artificially \u2013 in fact, artificial cloning has been carried out by \nhumans for hundreds of years. Artificial cloning  means that humans take control of the \nreproductive process so they can select the specific genetic information that is desired \nin the offspring. The cloning of organisms artificially can involve the use of reproductive \ncloning technologies.\nReproductive cloning technologies in plants\nCuttings\nWhen a cutting is taken from the stem, root or leaf of a plant, a new organism identical to \nthe parent plant can be produced. Each cutting will develop its own roots and grow into a \nwhole new plant. However, new varieties of plants cannot be created in this way. Taking \ncuttings is a common method used by gardeners to create new plants, as it is much faster \nthan growing plants from seeds.

For grafting to be successful, four conditions \nmust be met:\n \u2022The scion and stock must be compatible.\n \u2022Both scion and stock must be at the right stage of development.PPS Figure  7A\u20138  Many types of plants, including woody and herbaceous plants, can be propagated by \ncuttings, a form of artificial asexual reproduction.\n306\nCHAPTER 7 REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGIES, ADAPTATIONS AND DIVERSITY\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

This process is \nvery important in the horticulture industry, especially for growing citrus fruits and grape \nvines, as a disease-resistant rootstock is matched with a scion that produces more fruit but \nwould normally be susceptible to root diseases and/or pests.\nTissue culture\nWhen large numbers of plants need to be produced rapidly, a technique known as tissue \nculturing, or micropropagation , is used. Tissue or cells taken from the parent plant are placed \nin a special growing medium (containing nutrients, water and growth hormones) and in \ncertain conditions (specific temperature, humidity and so on).

  "Page 327": "Explaining sexual reproduction\nSexual reproduction requires two organisms of the same \nspecies, both contributing a sex cell, or gamete , that combine \nto produce a new unique offspring. You may already know that the gametes are produced in the \ngonads , or sex organs, of the \nmale (the testes) and the female (the ovaries) by the process of \nmeiosis . In animals, the male gamete is the sperm and the \nfemale gamete is the egg (ovum), while in plants the male gamete is the pollen and the female gamete is the ovum. Each gamete contains half the genetic information needed to form a new organism of the same species. In this way, when the two gametes meet, they fuse, in a process known as\n fertilisation , and \nform a zygote , which has the full set of genetic information, \nhalf from each parent. In Chapter 8, you will investigate how the genetic information inherited from each of the parents determines an organism\u2019s traits. As the zygote develops, it is creating new cells by the process of mitosis (see Chapter 3) and in this way it grows. Eventually its cells take on specialised functions and form the embryo of the organism.Figure 7B\u20134 Top: Cross-section of a flower.

This process occurs in the gonads of sexually reproducing organisms (in \nhumans, the testes and ovaries). The process begins with a parent cell, which is diploid, and \nresults in four \u2018daughter\u2019 cells (the gametes), which are haploid. Remember, the gametes \nmust contain only half the chromosomes of a somatic cell, so that when fertilisation occurs, \nthe resulting zygote has the full set of chromosomes or a diploid number of chromosomes.\nIn order to produce haploid gametes, meiosis involves two divisions of the nucleus, known \nas meiosis I and meiosis II.\n \u2022 In meiosis I, the chromosomes in the homologous pair separate and are pulled to \nopposite poles of the cell.\n \u2022 In meiosis II, the chromatids  in the double chromosome are pulled apart, forming a \nsingle chromosome, and the haploid gametes are produced.\nThese steps are further subdivided into several stages: interphase, prophase, metaphase, \nanaphase, telophase and cytokinesis (not a stage of meiosis). The events that occur during \nthese stages are very similar to mitosis, especially meiosis II, which you will see clarified in \nthe following pages.WORKSHEET 7B\u20131  \nCOMPARING \nASEXUAL \nAND SEXUAL \nREPRODUCTION\nChromatid  \none of two strands \nof a double \nchromosome \nformed when \na single \nchromosome is \nreplicated early \nin to mitosis or \nmeiosis; when \ntwo chromatids \nare joined at a \ncentromere, they \nare called sister \nchromatids and \nare identicalDOC\nVIDEO 7B\u20132 \nMEIOSIS\n318\nCHAPTER 7 REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGIES, ADAPTATIONS AND DIVERSITY\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

The non-sister chromatids of the homologous chromosomes \nare in contact with each other at points called chiasmata  (singular: chiasma ). This is \nthe physical point at which crossing over  may occur. The non-sister chromatids of a \nhomologous pair of chromosomes get so close that some of the genetic material from \nthe maternal chromosome swaps with some of the genetic material from the paternal \nchromosome. This results in the chromosomes being recombined in a new combination \nof genetic material, leading to more variation between the gametes.LINK UNIT 4\nSynapsis  \npairing of \nhomologous \nchromosomes \nduring prophase \nI of meiosis\nChiasma  \nthe point of \ncontact between \nnon-sister \nchromatids in a \nhomologous pair \nof chromosomes; \nthe point at \nwhich crossing \nover may occur\nCrossing over  \nexchange of \ngenetic material \nbetween \nnon-sister \nchromatids in a \nhomologous pair \nof chromosomes \nduring prophase \nI of meiosis; \noccurs at the \nchiasmata \nand results in \nrecombinant \nchromosomes, \nincreasing \nvariation \nbetween \ngametes\nDuplicated paternal\nchromosomeDuplicated maternal\nchromosome\nNon-sister\nchromatidsHomologous chromosomes\nexchange genetic materialNon-recombinant\nchromosomesRecombinant\nchromosomes\nFigure  7B\u20138  Crossing over during prophase I results in the formation of recombinant chromosomes \nwith a new combination of genetic material.

  "Page 342": "EXPLAIN\nIntroduction to adaptations\nIn Chapter 1, you learned about the characteristics that are necessary for life. While many \nof these processes may seem basic, it is important to remember that a huge number of \ndifferent life forms live in a wide range of environments around the world. This section \nlooks at the adaptations  of organisms that help them survive and flourish in their habitats. \nYou will read about the three main types of adaptation \u2013 behavioural, structural and \nphysiological \u2013 and explore a number of examples in depth.\nBehavioural adaptations\nBehavioural adaptations are the actions or activities of an organism that enable it to survive \nin its environment. They are the things that animals or plants do that help them to survive.\nYou will have heard about birds migrating \nbetween summer and winter climates \n(Figure 7C\u20132). This is an example of a \nbehavioural adaptation. Birds migrate \nfor various reasons: to find appropriate \nmating/nesting locations, to go where \nthere are better food sources, or simply to \navoid the cold by going to warmer areas.\nHibernation is another behavioural \nadaptation that you are probably familiar \nwith. Animals that hibernate (including \nbears, squirrels and some possums) stay \ninactive and are able to reduce their body \ntemperature, greatly slowing down their \nmetabolism. In this way, they are able to \nsurvive through the months when food \nsources are scarce.\nAlthough it is less obvious, plants have \nalso developed behavioural adaptations \nto help them survive. The Venus fly trap \n(Figure 7C\u20133) gets nutrition through \nconsuming insects. It does this by \nluring them into its open \u2018trap\u2019 and then \nsnapping it shut. However, this requires \nenergy and so it would be inefficient \nto close the trap every time something \nlanded on it. To avoid this potential \nproblem, the Venus fly trap only closes \nif the object that has landed in the trap \nmoves a couple of times, which indicates \nthat it is alive and most likely an insect.Adaptation  \na change that \nmakes an \norganism better \nsuited to its \nenvironment\nFigure  7C\u20132 Greylag geese fly very large distances, looking for warmer \nclimates in which to spend the winter months.\nFigure  7C\u20133  A Venus fly trap waits for its next meal.

Some examples that you may \nbe aware of are:\n \u2022a giraffe\u2019s long neck \u2013 helps it reach \nfood on tall trees\n \u2022bright feathers on a peacock \u2013 help it \nattract mates\n \u2022thorns on rose bushes \u2013 help protect \nthe plant from being eaten \n \u2022long eyelashes on a camel \u2013 help \nprevent sand from getting in its eyes.\nIt is important to realise that animals \nand plants are not making a conscious \ndecision to develop these adaptations to \nhelp them survive better. Instead, in every \npopulation, there exist individuals that \nare different. These differences are caused \nby small changes in the DNA sequence, \nwhich results in physical changes. In \nbiology, we call this variation . Occasionally \nthis variation leads to an individual being better suited to the environment, such as those \nmentioned in the bullet points above. Individuals that are better suited to the environment \nare more likely to survive to reproductive age and so pass on the genes for this different \nphysical trait to their offspring. Over time, this trait becomes increasingly common, until \nit is the standard, rather than the exception.

As these adaptations \nare harder to visualise, some \nexamples will help to highlight the \ntypes of physiological adaptations \nthat are possible.\nThe production of chemicals in \nthe body that provide a survival \nadvantage can be a form of \nphysiological adaptation. An example \nis the production of venom by snakes \n(Figure 7C\u20135). Snake venom can \nhave many functions, but it is most commonly associated with killing or immobilising prey. \nIn this way, snakes that produce a more effective venom can capture food more easily and \nthus are more likely to survive in their environment.\nPlants also have physiological adaptations that involve the use of chemicals. As you learned \nin Section 2D, plants require energy from sunlight to carry out photosynthesis. Therefore, \nit is crucial that they are able to always find sunlight. They have developed a mechanism \nto do this, called phototropism , which means they are able to alter the direction in which \nthey grow, in response to sunlight. If a plant grows towards the sunlight, it is called positive \nphototropism. Phototropism occurs because of a plant hormone called auxin, which \ncauses the cells that are furthest away from the light source to elongate. This results in the \nmovement (bending) of the plant towards the light, and higher rates of photosynthesis.\nFigure  7C\u20135  Snake venom is an example of a \nphysiological adaptation in an animal. This is the \nMozambique spitting cobra \u2013 you can see the venom \nbeing shot out towards a target, most likely its next meal.\nLINK2D ROLE OF \nCHLOROPLASTS \nAND \nMITOCHONDRIA\nPhototropism  \nthe process \nby which the \ngrowth and \norientation of an \norganism occurs \nin response to a \nlight stimulusLight\nLightAuxinAuxin\nAuxin spreads\nequally down bot h\nsides of the plantAuxin\ncollects on\nthe shaded side\nFigure  7C\u20136  The plant growth hormone, auxin, spreads evenly \nwhen a shoot is exposed to direct sunlight evenly.

In \na person who has this condition, the shape of the red blood cells is altered from the normal \n\u2018doughnut\u2019 shape to that of a sickle (Figure 7C\u20137). This shape makes the red blood cells less \neffective at carrying oxygen around the body.

This understanding is based on observations of their environment, both \nabiotic and biotic factors, and experience of what is needed by humans, plants and animals \nto survive in Australian environments.\nToday, knowledge of plant and animal adaptations to habitat and season is still essential for \nfinding food and materials in Australian environments.

  "Page 354": "Food chains and food webs\nThe easiest way to think about how organisms depend on other organisms for survival \nis in terms of what they eat. Another way is to consider the reason that organisms eat, \nwhich is to obtain energy. This way, we can also look at how energy is transferred between \norganisms.\nAs you learned in Section 1C, plants and some types of bacteria use the energy from the \nSun to make their nutrients. By doing this, these plants and bacteria make their own \nchemical energy. Organisms that do this are called autotrophs  (auto  = self, troph  = food). \nThis is the starting point for all the energy that passes through an ecosystem. In terms of a \nfood chain, autotrophs are called producers .\nWhen an organism can\u2019t produce its own nutrients, it must obtain them by ingesting other \norganisms. This type of organism is called a heterotroph (heteros = other,  troph = food). \nThe first class of heterotrophs obtain their nutrients by feeding on plants, and are called \nherbivores . As these organisms need to obtain their energy by eating another organism, \nthey are referred to as consumers . Animals that obtain their energy through ingesting \nproducers are known as primary consumers , as they are the first step in the food chain after \nthe photosynthetic organisms. Another class of consumers is those that don\u2019t eat plants, \nbut instead eat other animals. These are known as carnivores  and, in a food chain, are called \nsecondary consumers .\nThere are other classes of heterotrophs that differ \nfrom these consumers in a significant way. While \nthe ones discussed above feed on living organisms, \nsome organisms obtain their nutrients from dead \nplant and animal material. Two main types that \nyou should know are detritivores  and decomposers . \nBoth feed on the organic material obtained from \ndead organisms. The difference between them is \ntheir mode of \u2018digestion\u2019.

If you \nthink about the food chain above, what effect(s) do you think wiping out the wolves would \nhave had? Your initial response might be to think that, without wolves being around, nothing \nwould eat the elk and so elk numbers would increase. This is true, but it was only the start of \nthe changes that occurred.\nIn fact, the absence of wolves created \na huge flow-on effect, including the \nfollowing:\n1  More elk meant that more plants \nwere being eaten.\n2  Not only were the elk eating more \ngrass, but they weren\u2019t worried about \nbeing hunted by wolves. This meant  \nthat they weren\u2019t constantly on the \nmove, and instead stayed in one \nlocation for much longer and ate \nthe grass in that location until it was \nalmost depleted.\n3  Plant species such as aspen and \nriverside willows declined in \nnumbers.\n4  Riverside willows were used by \nbeavers to make dams, so the \ndecline in the willows meant that \nbeaver numbers also declined.\n5  The lack of beaver dams had a \nnegative impact on aquatic plant \nand animal life.\n6  Many flower species were negatively \naffected by the elk spending more \ntime near the river.\n7  The lack of flowers caused a decrease \nin insect species, as well as the \nsongbirds that fed on the insects.Figure  7D\u20136  A diagram showing that in Yellowstone National Park the \nwolf has impacts on a huge number of other plant and animal species, \nboth directly (solid arrow) and indirectly (dashed arrow).

Through this single \nchange, which resulted in the elk\u2019s natural \npredator being present in the ecosystem, all \nthe changes were slowly reversed. Indeed, \nthere were even other impacts that had \npreviously gone unnoticed. A summary of \nthese effects is shown in Figure 7D\u20136.\nThis example highlights the impact that a \npredator, especially a high-level one,  \ncan have on an ecosystem. By hunting  \nand feeding on the organisms below it in  \nthe food chain, a predator can keep the  \nentire system in balance.\nKeystone species don\u2019t have to be predators. Indeed, organisms almost at the opposite end \nof the food chain spectrum can be considered keystone species.

However, the consequences could actually be catastrophic.\nWhy are bees crucial to Earth\u2019s ecosystems? The answer lies in their role as pollinators \n(Figure 7D\u20137).

  "Page 358": "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledge and perspectives in \nunderstanding interdependencies of species\nUp until this point, we have discussed ecosystems and the interdependency of organisms \nusing various examples of plants and animals. It is important to remember that humans are \njust another animal that coexists in these environments, although we do not always do so \nharmoniously. However, there is no better evidence of how humans can learn, understand \nand participate in an interdependent ecosystem than that of Aboriginal and Torres Strait \nIslander peoples.\nCaring for Country\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples regard themselves as part of nature and the \nenvironment, not above animals and plants, as many in Western culture often think of \nthemselves. The traditional world view of integration with biotic and abiotic factors of the \nenvironment, in a deep understanding of ecosystems and their place in them, encourages \nsustainable use of environmental resources for the benefit of the people. Seeing oneself as \npart of the ecosystem is key. This is the essence of \u2018caring for Country\u2019.\nAn example of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples\u2019 sustainable use is the \nharvesting of turtles and dugongs. Large numbers have been hunted for thousands of years, \nwithout decline, even after colonisation. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples \nwho hunt them are aware of their interdependence and reliance upon them. To ensure \nsustainability of supply, they impose cultural controls on where and how they hunt them, \nas well as who can hunt them. There are rules on how they are killed, processed, distributed \nand shared within the community. When hunting dugongs, young male dugongs are \npreferred, whereas pregnant females and those with calves are left alone. These rules are \nshared among the community.\nMutual benefit in interdependence\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who hunt dugongs see themselves as part of the \necosystem and dependent on the dugongs. This is an example of a predator\u2013prey relationship.\nIn the case of some other \nspecies, the relationship is \nmore complex. If you looked \nat the relationship between \nAboriginal and Torres Strait \nIslander peoples and their \nhunting of kangaroos, this \npredator\u2013prey relationship \nmight appear to have no \nbenefit for the kangaroos. \nHowever, research has \nshown that, in one area of \nWestern Australia, hunting \nof kangaroos by the Martu \npeople coupled with their \nmanaged burning of the bush \nresults in higher populations \nof kangaroos than in similar \nareas where hunting occurs \nbut no burning \u2013 even if the Figure  7D\u20138  Aboriginal rangers work with Landcare to track the endangered \nblack-footed rock wallaby at Ernabella in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara \nLands, South Australia.\n346\nCHAPTER 7 REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGIES, ADAPTATIONS AND DIVERSITY\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",
  "Page 359": "This beneficial effect of burning also applies to populations of sand monitor lizards, which \ndon\u2019t graze on grass. For these lizards, the beneficial effect may come from the burning \nresulting in a diverse patchwork of vegetation leading to greater diversity of insect and \nsmall mammal food for the lizards. \nBilbies benefit from firestick farming, as it \nprovides fresh plant growth in burned areas, \nwhich they prefer. Firestick farming also \nprevents more serious fires, which would \nburn all the vegetation cover that bilbies \nrely on to hide from predators, particularly \nferal cats. Some Aboriginal people formerly \nused bilbies as food and have been involved \nin conservation efforts since the bilbies\u2019 \nnumbers have declined. The Kaytetye people \nin the Northern Territory benefit from \nbilbies, because bilbies have a keen sense \nof hearing and like to eat witchetty grubs, \nwhich they can hear chewing on roots in \nthe ground. The sound of bilbies scratching \nat the soil alerts the people to the fact that \nfully grown grubs are moving to the surface, \nand are therefore easier to harvest for the \nKaytetye people.\nFigure  7D\u20139  An Aboriginal girl in Arnhem Land, Monica, \nusing a firestick to burn dry grass before the wet season, \nwhen lightning strikes in wind could cause much more serious \nfires. A similar method, called firestick farming, is used in \nother parts of Australia to \u2018cool burn\u2019 patches of bush, which \nwill encourage new grass growth, which in turn will attract \nkangaroos. Fire is the most-used traditional tool for land \nmanagement by Aboriginal Australians.\nFigure  7D\u201310  Kangaroo numbers have been shown to \nbe greater where traditional burning is used to promote \nthe growth of new grass, despite the effects of hunting.hunting in the burned areas is heavier. In other words, managed burning of the vegetation \ncounters the effect of hunting. The reason appears to be that the flush of new growth after a \nburn provides more grass and supresses plants that kangaroos don\u2019t eat. In fact, Aboriginal \nfirestick farming promotes the spread of grassland. Kangaroos, grass and humans are \ninterdependent, meaning their ecological relationship is mutually beneficial. This is shown \nin Figures 7D\u20139 and 7D\u201310.\nFigure  7D\u201311  A bilby in central Australia\n347 7D SURVIVING THROUGH INTERDEPENDENCIES, WITH INDIGENOUS PERSPECTIVES\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

When discussing these relationships from a food source perspective, one way \nof representing them is through a food chain or a food web. If you are required to draw \none, there are some key things to remember.\nArrows\nAn arrow indicates a relationship between two organisms. Conventionally, the arrow \ngoes from the organism being consumed to the organism that is feeding on it. An \nexample of this is shown below, where the hawk eats the mouse. You can see both the \nright way (top) and the wrong way (bottom) of drawing it.\nFood chain or food web?\nWhen deciding how to illustrate relationships between organisms, it is important \nto choose the style of diagram that is appropriate to the situation. Remember that \nfood chains are linear, whereas food webs can show multiple interactions for a single \norganism. Consider the example ecosystem described in the following paragraph:\n\u2018The desert has a very dynamic ecosystem. There are a number of plants, which \nprovide nutrition for insects and certain rabbit species. There are lizards, which feed \non insects. Snakes that will eat lizards and rabbits. Large birds that also hunt lizards \nand rabbits, as well as snakes.\u2019\nTry drawing this as a food chain and as a food web. Which do you think gives you a \nmore complete overview of the ecosystem described?\nYou should find that the food web is a better option in this case, as many of the \norganisms have multiple, overlapping food sources. For example, lizards are eaten \nby both snakes and large birds, where the large birds also eat rabbits. These multiple \nrelationships would be impossible to illustrate in a linear food chain.\nChanges to a food web\nIn this section, you also learned about the concept of keystone species and how their \nremoval from an ecosystem can have a large impact.

If a food source becomes more plentiful, t he numbers of the organisms \nthat eat it may increase. If a food source disappears (e.g. becomes extinct), then the \nnumbers of the organisms that feed off that source will also decrease, which may have \na rolling effect throughout the ecosystem.\n \u2022Habitat:  how does the change affect where certain organisms in that ecosystem \nlive? As an example, imagine a species is introduced that fe eds off a certain type \nof tree until there is very little left. Imagine that squirrels were using those trees as \ntheir home. You could see that this may lead to a decrease in squirrel numbers. The \ndecrease in squirrel numbers would also affect everything else in the food web that \nfed off the squirrels.\nThere are often many outcomes to a single change, and it is important to try and think \nof as many of these as possible and the consequences that arise from this.\n350\nCHAPTER 7 REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGIES, ADAPTATIONS AND DIVERSITY\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

  "Page 368": "Introduction\nHave you ever wondered why your physical features resemble those of your parents? Or why \nyou have different-coloured eyes or a different blood type from your parents? In the mid-19th \ncentury, an Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel was investigating the inheritance and genetics \nof sweet pea plants by studying the transmission of particular traits (stem height, seed colour and \nshape) over generations. His early work revealed that genes come in pairs (one from each parent) \nand established the mathematical pattern of inheritance that is still used today, even though the \nimportance of his work was not recognised until after his death.\nWith the discovery of DNA in the 20th century, much of Mendel\u2019s work could be explained by \nthe inheritance of genes or, more specifically, forms of genes (called alleles), by offspring from \ntheir parents. Recent research and technologies now make it possible to screen for the presence or \nabsence of particular gene products and proteins, and even to manipulate genes.\nThis chapter explores the structure of DNA and its transmission between generations. It also \ndemonstrates how Punnett squares are used to predict the inheritance of traits, and how pedigrees \nare used to track this over multiple generations in a family.\nCurriculum\nArea of Study 1 Outcome 1\nHow is inheritance explained?\nStudy Design Learning intentions \u2013 at the end of this chapter I will be able to:\nFrom chromosomes to genomes\n\u2022  The distinction between \ngenes, alleles and a genome\n\u2022  The nature of a pair of  \nhomologous chromosomes \ncarrying the same gene \nloci and the distinction  \nbetween autosomes and \nsex chromosomes\n\u2022  Variability of \nchromosomes in terms \nof size and number in \ndifferent organisms8A   The nature of genes\n8A.1 Define gene, allele and genome\n8A.2  Apply the terms gene and allele in the correct context \nwithin a question\n8A.3  Draw and annotate a pair of homologous chromosomes\n8A.4  Explain how chromosomes vary between speciesUNIT  \n2 \nCHAPTER  \n8INHERITANCEHOW DOES INHERITANCE IMPACT ON DIVERSITY?\n356\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

All DNA can be passed on from parents to offspring during meiosis \nin plants and animals, as you learned in Chapter 7. Alterations, such as addition or \nduplications of sections of DNA, can occur, and this increased amount of DNA can then \nbe passed onto offspring without affecting their survival. You\u2019ll learn more about this \nwhen studying protein synthesis in Unit 3. If this were to occur in the regions of DNA \nthat code for proteins, it could create a new protein or trait, making the individual more \nor less suited to their environment.LINKLINK1A LIVING OR \nNON-LIVING\n7B ASEXUAL \nREPRODUCTION \nAND MEIOSIS\nLINK UNIT 3\nFigure 8A\u20131  An onion and an amoeba, both living, each contain more DNA than humans.\n360\nCHAPTER 8 INHERITANCE \nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",
  "Page 373": "EXPLAIN\nThe importance of DNA\nDNA is the fundamental macromolecule that is passed from pre-existing cells to new \ncells. In the same way, offspring inherit their DNA from their parent(s). This chapter \nfocuses on genetics , the study of inheritance , with particular emphasis on plants and \nanimals. This area of biology has become even more important in the past few decades for \nthe breeding of plants and animals, conservation of species, human health and prevention \nof disease.\nIn plant and animal cells, DNA is wound tightly around proteins, called histones, forming \nchromosomes, as you learned in Chapter 3. These organisms inherit one copy of a particular \nchromosome from each parent. Each pair of chromosomes, or homologous pair, carries the \nsame types of genes , which are sections of DNA that code for a polypeptide (protein). For \nexample, in humans, the gene for the protein insulin is located on chromosome number 11.  \nThe insulin gene can be found at this location, called its gene locus , on every chromosome 11 \nin all humans. Copies of the same gene are found at the corresponding locus of each member \nof a pair of homologous chromosomes. As you will remember, this protein is essential in \nhelping to keep blood glucose levels within a specific narrow range, and so maintaining the \ncorrect base sequence of DNA in this gene is crucial to the protein\u2019s function.\nHowever, the sequence of DNA bases that code for a gene may not always be exactly the \nsame. These slightly different forms of the gene are referred to as alleles . Alleles arise by \nmutation, which can occur during the replication of DNA, in the \u2018synthesis\u2019 or \u2018S\u2019 phase \nduring interphase in the cell cycle. Mutations may also occur spontaneously or be caused by \nenvironmental factors, known as mutagens . Ultimately, mutations cause the nucleotide \nsequence to differ from the normal gene by a few nucelotides or even a single nucleotide. \nIn the case of the insulin gene, the consequence of a mutation is the production of an \naltered version of insulin that can no longer help maintain stable blood glucose levels. If this \nmutation occurs in a germline cell (a cell in the ovaries or testes) prior to entering meiosis, \nthe mutation can be passed onto the daughter cell, which is a gamete (egg or sperm, \nin humans).LINK3A WHERE DO \nNEW CELLS COME \nFROM?\nLINK5B \nHOMEOSTASIS \nIN ANIMALS\nGenetics  \nthe study of \ninheritance\nInheritance  \nhow genetic \nmaterial is \npassed on from \none generation \nto the next\nLINK3B THE CELL \nCYCLE\nFigure  8A\u20132  The relationship between DNA, chromosome formation, gene loci, genes and alleles\nDNA\nGene loci\nDNA wrapping\naround histones\nChromosomeAlleles of \ninsulin geneSection of base sequence in  \ninsulin:\n\u2026ATGCTGTACCA GCATCTGCTC\nMutated section of base\nsequence in insulin:\n\u2026ATGCTGTACCA ACATCTGCTC\nPPSGene locus  \nthe position \nof a gene on a \nchromosome; \nplural: gene loci\nAllele  \nan alternative \nform of a geneGene \na sequence \nof DNA that \ncodes for the \nproduction of a \npolypeptideVIDEO 8A\u20131  DNA, \nCHROMOSOMES \nAND KARYOTYPES\nLINK7B SEXUAL \nREPRODUCTION \nAND MEIOSIS\n361 8A THE NATURE OF GENES\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

Table 8A\u20131 provides a comparison of the \nsize of the genome of different species. Why do eukaryoti c organisms have more proteins \nthan genes, and why do some seemingly basic organisms, like amoebas and onions, have \nmore DNA than complex organisms like humans? This is due to alternative splicing  and \nmutations, both of which will be explored in further detail in Units 3 and 4.\nTable  8A\u20131  Comparing genome size, and gene and chromosome numbers of different species\nOrganism Genome size\n(base pairs)Estimated number \nof genesNumber of \nchromosomes\nHomo sapiens  \n(human)2 900 000 000 20  000\u201325  000 46\nAmoeba dubia \n(amoeba)670 000 000 000 unconfirmed 500\nAllium cepa  (onion) 18 000 000 000 unconfirmed 16\nCanis familiaris  (dog) 2 400 000 000 19 000 78\nDrosophila \nmelanogaster (fruit fly)120 000 000 13 600 8\nEscherichia coli  \n(bacterium)4 100 000 2000\u20133000 1 (circular)\nThis data has been generated by \ncomparative genomics , which compares \nthe genomes of different species.

These cells are referred to as being diploid, which is represented as 2n, where n is the number of chromosomes in one set of the organism\u2019s chromosomes. Therefore, in humans, who have 46 chromosomes in their somatic cells, the diploid number, or 2n, is 46, which means that n is 23.\nAdditionally, recall that the daughter \ncells produced from meiosis contain half the number of chromosomes (one set) compared to the parent cell. These cells are referred to as being haploid and are represented by n. This should confirm for you the reason why meiosis is crucial for an organism: it ensures that each parent\u2019s gamete only passes on exactly one (no more and no less) complete set of chromosomes to the offspring. This is shown in Figure 8A\u20136.\nThe nature of homologous chromosomes\nChromosomes are made up of segments of DNA, which, as you have already learned, are called genes.

Note, however, that the two sister chromatids  on a double chromosome \nboth have the same gene sequence, and therefore allele, as this has resulted from DNA \nreplication in the S phase of interphase. In contrast, the non-sister chromatids  in the \nhomologous pair can have different variations of genes (alleles) as they come from \ndifferent parents.\nRecall that a karyotype is a pictorial representation of the chromosomes in the nucleus of \nan individual\u2019s somatic cell.

If you zoom in on one of these pairs, chromosome 11 (Figure 8A\u20138), \nyou will find this chromosome includes the haemoglobin beta gene.

Notice that, in the \nhomologous pair, one of these chromosomes contains the base sequence ACTTC for the \nnormal allele, while the other contains the base sequence ACATC for the mutated sickle \ncell allele.

You should already have seen from this \nsection that key terms and diagrams from Chapters 1, 3 and 7 are being used extensively.\nIt is crucial for your understanding of this section that you know the differences between \nthese terms, how to represent them diagrammatically or label them in a diagram, and \nuse them in the correct written context.\nFor a diagram like Figure 8A\u20137, you should be able to explain the difference between \nsister and non-sister chromatids, and know which contain the same or different alleles/\nnucleotides. You need to be aware that terms such as \u2018DNA\u2019 and \u2018gene\u2019 could be used \ninterchangeably, and that an allele is just a form of a gene or a specific sequence of \nnucleotides. You should also be able to add extra detail to these images. In this instance, \ncould you represent and explain how a chromosome unravels to form DNA, and what \nthe structure of DNA looks like? Could you look at this image and explain whether a cell \nwould be going through mitosis or meiosis? If a cell is going through meiosis, what stage \nincludes the presence of pairs of homologous chromosomes?\nThis skill of adding new information and relating it to previously learned knowledge \nis crucial for understanding Units 3 and 4 Biology, and for successfully answering \nquestions in assessments and in the end-of-year exam. This is also why developing \nconcept maps and/or mind maps, which have been covered in earlier chapters, is an \nexcellent way to compile and make sense of all this information.\nKaryotype of Drosophila \nmelanogasterVIDEO 8A\u20132 \nSKILLS: \nCOMPILING \nTERMS FROM \nACROSS \nDIFFERENT \nTOPICS\n366\nCHAPTER 8 INHERITANCE \nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

Take a look around you: the person sitting next \nto you, your teacher, parents and siblings are all different (unless you have an identical \ntwin).

  "Page 380": "For traits determined by a \nsingle gene with only two alleles \n(complete dominance ), rather \nthan writing out the entire \nDNA base sequence for each \nallele, geneticists use letters to \nrepresent these. Commonly, an \nuppercase or a lowercase letter is \nused to denote each allele.\nFor example, consider the gene \nthat codes for earlobes, which  \ncan be unattached or attached \n(Figure 8B\u20131). The letters \u2018E\u2019 and \n\u2018e\u2019 can be used to represent these \ntwo alleles, where:\n\u2018E = unattached\u2019 and \u2018e = attached\u2019.\nAn uppercase letter typically represents the dominant  trait, and a lowercase letter typically \nrepresents the recessive  trait. Therefore, in this example, unattached earlobes is the \ndominant trait, and attached earlobes is the recessive trait. A common misconception is \nto assume that the dominant trait is automatically the trait that is most common in the \npopulation, but this is not always the case. The dominant trait is the trait that is seen when \nan individual has two different alleles for a gene. For example, an individual with both an \nuppercase and a lowercase letter for the alleles for earlobe appearance (e.g. Ee) is referred \nto as being heterozygous  (hetero =  different , zygous =  the diploid cell that forms from the \nfusion of two haploid cells). An individual with two copies of the same allele (e.g. EE or ee) \nis referred to as homozygous  (homo =  same or common).\nGenotypes and phenotypes\nThe combination of alleles that an organism has for a gene is referred to as its genotype . So, \nfor the difference in earlobes, these two alleles can result in three possible genotypes, as \nshown in Table 8B\u20131.Figure  8B\u20131  Unattached versus attached earlobes, a single-\ngene trait determined by only two allelesUnattached (E) Attached (e)\nTable  8B\u20131  Genotype and phenotype of individuals with different earlobes, from Figure 8B\u20131\nIndividual Description Genotype Phenotype\n1 Homozygous dominant EE Unattached earlobes\n2 Heterozygous Ee Unattached earlobes\n3 Homozygous recessive ee Attached earlobesDominant  \nthe trait \nexpressed in a \nheterozygous \nindividual\nRecessive  \nthe trait not \nexpressed in a \nheterozygous \nindividual\nHeterozygous  \nhaving two \ndifferent alleles \nfor a gene\nHomozygous  \nhaving two \ncopies of the \nsame allele for \na gene\nGenotype  \nthe combination \nof alleles that an \norganism has for \na geneComplete \ndominance  \nwhen the allele \nfor the dominant \ntrait completely \nmasks (hides) \nthe allele for the \nrecessive traitEXPLAIN\nBasic allelic notation\nMost cells in an organism contain the same DNA and therefore the same number of \nchromosomes. As half your chromosomes are inherited from your mother and the other \nhalf from your father, every trait determined by your genes is coded for by two alleles. The \ntwo alleles can be the same or different. So in every diploid or somatic cell, there are two \ncopies of a gene.\n368\nCHAPTER 8 INHERITANCE \nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

An individual with \nthe genotype \u2018Ee\u2019 would also have the \n\u2018unattached earlobes\u2019 phenotype.

In addition to these, epigenetics  can also influence a phenotype. Epigenetic  \n(epi = above, genetics  = relating to genes or heredity) factors affect how genes are \u2018read\u2019 by \ncells and these changes influence the production of proteins, by regulating whether the \ngenes are \u2018turned on\u2019 or \u2018turned off\u2019 in cells. This ensures that particular proteins are not \nproduced in cells that do not require them. For example, you would not want the protein \nkeratin, which makes up fingernails and toenails, to be produced in cells in your eye, so \nthis gene is turned off in these cells. Epigenetics is also extremely important in helping to \ndetermine the specialisation of a cell from its stem cell or as an embryo develops into a \nfoetus and then into a baby.Epigenetics  \nmechanisms \nthat regulate \ngene expression, \ncausing changes \nto the phenotype\n3A WHERE DO \nNEW CELLS \nCOME FROM?LINKDOC\n369 8B INTRODUCTION TO GENETICS\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

This is not the case. For example, Huntington disease is \ndominant to the normal (non-Huntington disease) phenotype, and this is a condition \nthat definitely does not affect most individuals within the population. \u2018Dominant\u2019 \nsimply refers to the phenotype that overrides and hides the recessive phenotype in a \nheterozygous individual.\nThe second misconception or mistake many people make is to refer to \u2018dominant\u2019 and \n\u2018recessive\u2019 alleles . This is not entirely true, as you will see in Section 8C. If you refer to an \nallele being dominant or recessive compared to another allele, this becomes confusing \nwhen investigating traits that do not show complete dominance. There are phenotypes \nthat are codominant, meaning both alleles are expressed in the heterozygous individual, \nand phenotypes that display incomplete dominance, where a blend of the two alleles is \nseen in the heterozygote, giving a different phenotype than either parent. Some traits \nare controlled by more than one gene, and for these it can be difficult to state that one \nspecific allele is dominant over another.\nTherefore, this textbook refers to phenotypes or specific traits , rather than alleles, as \nbeing dominant or recessive.LINK8C MONOHYBRID \nCROSSES\nSection 8B questions\n1 Cystic fibrosis is a homozygous recessive disorder.\na Using the letter \u2018c\u2019, define the alleles for both \u2018normal\u2019 (not having cystic fibrosis) and \n\u2018cystic fibrosis\u2019 traits.\nb Why is \u2018c\u2019 not the best letter to use to represent these alleles?

At this time, \nnothing was known of DNA or its structure, but at a similar time, work was being \nundertaken by Charles Darwin, in developing his theory on natural selection. (You\u2019ll \nlearn more about this in Unit 4.)\nMendel\u2019s work with key pea plant characteristics, including stem length, seed shape and \nseed colour, is regarded as the foundation of our understanding today. He observed, \ncounted and recorded the results of 1064 plants. Like Darwin, Mendel noted that \noffspring resembled their parents. One key result came when he observed flower colour. \nAfter crossing a purple-flowered plant and a white-flowered plant, he noticed that all \nthe offspring had purple flowers. However, when he then crossed those purple-flowered \nplants with each other, the flowers produced were both purple and white; there were no \nflowers of different colours or mixed colour. As with many other traits we know today, \nthe colour of Mendel\u2019s flowers demonstrated that inheritance did not produce a mixture \nof the two traits, and that the presence of white flowers had skipped a generation. As you \nlearned in Sections 8A and 8B, we now call these alternative forms of a gene \u2018alleles\u2019, and \nwe refer to particular phenotypes as being dominant or recessive.\nThis section explores how scientists represent the passing on of alleles from parents \nto offspring using Punnett squares, and how Punnett squares are also used to predict \ngenotypic and phenotypic ratios.LINK UNIT 4\nFigure  8C\u20131  One of Mendel\u2019s pea plant experiments\nA\nA\na\na\nParents (P)Parental\ngametes First generation (F1) Second generation (F2)     Phenotype 3 purple : 1 white\nGenotype 1AA: 2Aa: 1aa\nA\nA\nAA Aa\nAa aaa\naPure-breeding\npurple \ufb02owers\nAa\naaAA\nPure-breeding\nwhite \ufb02owersPurple\n\ufb02owersSelf-pollinationCross-pollinationLINK8A THE NATURE \nOF GENES\nLINK8B \nINTRODUCTION \nTO GENETICS\n372\nCHAPTER 8 INHERITANCE \nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

This means they only contain one set, or half, of the DNA compared \nto typical somatic diploid cells. Therefore, each gamete carries only one allele of a particular \ngene for that individual.\nTo return to the example of earlobes from Section 8B, if a female has unattached earlobes \nwith a genotype \u2018Ee\u2019, she will pass on either the \u2018E\u2019 or the \u2018e\u2019 allele to each of her gametes.\nWe can use this knowledge of the formation of gametes with the presence of particular \nalleles in parents from Figure 8C\u20132 to determine the possibility of different genotypes, \nand consequently phenotypes, in the offspring. This can be done using a Punnett square . \nA Punnett square represents the possible alleles in the gametes formed by each parent, \nwhere one parent is written along the top of the table and the other parent is written down \nthe left-hand side of the table. It also shows the potential combination of alleles from both \nparents (genotype) in the offspring.\n373 8C MONOHYBRID CROSSES\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

Therefore, in the female parent we know that each time an \novum is produced, it will have either the \u2018E\u2019 (unattached earlobes) or \u2018e\u2019 (attached earlobes) \nallele. Similarly, in the male parent, half of the sperm will have the \u2018E\u2019 allele and the other \nhalf will have the \u2018e\u2019 allele. From this we can set up the Punnett square, as shown here.\nGenotype of  \nfemale: Ee\nE e\nGenotype of  \nmale: EeE EE Ee\ne Ee ee\nNotice that from a genetic cross between two heterozygous parents, the offspring can have \nany of the three possible genotypes. In fact, any cross between two heterozygous individuals \nwill always give the same ratio of genotypes (1 : 2 : 1) and phenotypes (3 : 1).\nThe reason for the difference between these ratios is that the presence of the capital \u2018E\u2019 \nallele in the two heterozygous genotypes means that both these possibilities will display the \ndominant trait, as will the homozygous genotype. These ratios are represented as:\nGenotypic ratio = 1 EE : 2 Ee : 1 ee\nPhenotypic ratio = 3 unattached earlobes : 1 attached earlobes\nAlso note that these ratios are all determined based on probability. In real life, if you had a \nsample size of 100 individuals, you would not expect exactly three-quarters (75) of them to \nhave unattached earlobes and one-quarter (25) of them to have attached earlobes. However, \nthe numbers should be relatively close to these values. The larger the sample size of \nindividuals being compared, the closer the actual numbers will be to those predicted by the \nratios from the Punnett square.\nThe genotypic and phenotypic ratios will be different depending on the genotypes of the \nparents. If both parents are homozygous dominant, \u2018EE\u2019, then the only allele they will pass \nonto their gametes is \u2018E\u2019, so all offspring will have the same genotype and phenotype as both \nparents. The same applies to the scenario where both parents are homozygous recessive.

However, the sex \nchromosomes also contain many genes. A common sex-linked gene  located on the X \nchromosome is one that produces a pigment in the cones of the retina. In some individuals, \ndeficiencies or complete absence of these cones can result in colour blindness.\nRed\u2013green colour blindness is the most common inherited form of colour blindness and is \ncaused by an X-linked  (located on the X chromosome in humans) recessive gene. Therefore, \nits gene locus is on the X chromosome only; it does not exist on the Y chromosome, which \nis much shorter and carries fewer genes, as shown in Figure 8C\u20135.Sex-linked gene  \na gene located \non a sex \nchromosome (X \nor Y in humans)\nX-linked  \nrefers to a \ngene that is \nlocated on the X \nchromosome (in \nhumans)\nMale Female \nFigure  8C\u20135  Human karyotypes showing the size difference \nbetween the X and Y chromosomes\n381 8C MONOHYBRID CROSSES\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",
  "Page 394": "Recall from Section 7B that a female has two X chromosomes and a male has a single X and \na single Y chromosome. This means that, for a female to be affected, she must inherit two \nalleles for the red\u2013green colour-blind gene. If she only inherits one copy of the allele for \nred\u2013green colour blindness, then she is referred to as a carrier . A male, on the other hand, \nonly needs to inherit one colour blind allele, and this must come from the mother because \nthe father passes on the Y chromosome to their sons. Males can never be carriers for a \nsex-linked gene. This is because, unlike other genes where two alleles are present in the \nindividual, sex-linked genes in males only have one allele. Therefore, we say that males are \nhemizygous . As such, males are affected more frequently (approximately 8%) by sex-linked \ntraits than females (less than 1%).\nTherefore, the possible genotypes for males and females are different from those for genes \nlocated on autosomes, and are also represented differently. This can be seen in Table 8C\u20134. \nThe table shows how sex-linked genes are inherited and that this process is exactly the \nsame as for other genes on autosomes.\nThere are also Y-linked  genes. These genes occupy a gene locus on the Y chromosome and \ntherefore in humans are only present in males. With any Y-linked gene, if the father has the \ntrait, then all his sons will also inherit the trait as he passes the Y chromosome to them.

In the examples used here, \nwhole numbers have been used to represent the ratios, but in some cases fractions \nare used.\nLooking back to Worked example 8C\u20131, where a homozygous dominant female with \nunattached earlobes was crossed with a heterozygous male, the following Punnett square \nand ratios were recorded:\nGenotype of  \nfemale: EE\nE E\nGenotype of  \nmale: EeE EE EE\ne Ee Ee\nGenotypic ratio = 1 EE : 1 Ee\nPhenotypic ratio = 1 unattached earlobes\nThe genotypic ratio can also be represented as:\nGenotypic ratio = 1\n2 EE : 1\n2 Ee\nIf the phenotypic ratio were to be represented in this way, it would look like this:\nPhenotypic ratio = 4\n4 unattached earlobes\nThe fraction 4\n4 is equal to 1. As in maths, a fraction or ratio is always simplified, and this \nis why this textbook uses whole numbers for representing the genotypic and phenotypic \nratios. However, it is best to follow the method preferred by your teacher/school. (For \nexample, some teachers might use percentages.)\nImportance of justifying answers using Punnett squares\nMany questions in this inheritance topic will be in the form: \u2018What are the chances of \nparents A and B having a child with condition X?\u2019\nIf you know the genotypes of the parents and you\u2019ve memorised the expected genotypic \nand phenotypic ratios of a cross between these two parents, then it appears quite simple \nto just provide the answer. However, when asked this type of question it is important to \nshow proof. This is done by setting up and completing a Punnett square using the steps \nexplained at the beginning of this section.VIDEO 8C\u20133 \nSKILLS: WRITING \nGENOTYPIC AND \nPHENOTYPIC \nRATIOS FOR \nMONOHYBRID \nCROSSES\n384\nCHAPTER 8 INHERITANCE \nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

This way of \nrepresenting the genotypes for an individual shows that the alleles for one gene are \nfollowed by the alleles for the other gene.WORKSHEET 8D\u20131  \nPUNNETT SQUARES \nFOR DIHYBRID \nCROSSESDOCPPS\nVIDEO 8D\u20132  \nSKILLS: WRITING \nGENOTYPES FOR \nDIHYBRID CROSSES\n399 8D DIHYBRID CROSSES\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

Therefore, when completing the Punnett square \nfor the cross, there is no need to write the same combination of alleles more than once. \nIt will not change the expected phenotypic ratios observed for the offspring.\nFor example, in a cross between the unlinked genes AaBb \u00d7 AABB:\nParental genotype: AaBb\nA B A b a B a b\nParental \ngenotype: \nAABBA B AABB AABb AaBB AaBb\nThe four possible gametes p roduc ed from meiosis in this organism will all have the alleles \n\u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019.

The ratio would not change.\nWorking out the combination of alleles on chromosomes in the heterozygous parent\nQuestions about dihybrid test crosses involving linked genes will often ask you to \ndetermine the combination of alleles that are on the same chromosome (chromatid) \ntogether in the heterozygous parent.\nMost students assume that the uppercase letters of the two genes are always together on \none of the chromosomes and the lowercase letters of the two genes are together on the \nother chromosome in the homologous pair. But this is not always the case, and there is a \n\u2018trick\u2019 to working this out.\nLet\u2019s look at an example:\nA test cross between a heterozygous grey body, normal-winged fruit fly and a black body, \nvestigial-wing fruit fly produced the following results:\nPhenotype Grey body, \nnormal wingsGrey body, \nvestigial wingsBlack body, \nnormal wingsBlack body, \nvestigial wings\nOffspring \nnumber3 \n(Recombinant)45 \n(Parental)49 \n(Parental)2 \n(Recombinant)\nFor this question, there are some things you can identify immediately:\n \u2022The ratio is not 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 and there are four distinct phenotypes.

This helps to minimise any uncontrolled variables. The pea plants can also \nbe produced from seeds in large numbers, as increasing the sample size improves the \nreliability and accuracy of investigations.\nFigure  8E\u20131  A family tree shows individuals and \ntheir relationship with each other over many \ngenerations.LINK\nLINK6A INVESTIGATIVE \nDESIGN\n6B SCIENTIFIC \nEVIDENCEPedigree chart  \na chart used \nto trace the \ninheritance of a \nphenotype over \ngenerations\n404\nCHAPTER 8 INHERITANCE \nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

  "Page 419": "Analysing pedigrees\nGenetic disorders arise from mutations and, as you know, these disorders may be dominant \nor recessive. Their gene locus may be on an autosome or a sex chromosome. The alleles for \nthese phenotypes are passed on to offspring from the parents. The advantage of observing \nindividuals in the pedigree is that you can determine whether a disorder (or any trait) is \ndominant or recessive, and also predict the transmission from parents to offspring. In order \nto do this, you will need to use your knowledge of genotypes and phenotypes, dominant \nand recessive, homozygous and heterozygous, and Punnett squares, as you have learned in \nSections 8A to 8C. Some traits and their patterns to watch for are described in the following \nworked examples.LINK8A THE NATURE \nOF GENES\nWorked example 8E\u20131\nWorked example 8E\u20132Identifying autosomal recessive traits\nRecall that for a recessive trait to be displayed, an individual needs to have two copies of \nthe same allele for that trait (homozygous), which they have inherited from each parent.\nIt is possible for two unaffected (do not display the phenotype) parents to produce \naffected (have the phenotype) offspring. \nFor this to occur, both parents must \nbe heterozygous (carriers), and the \noffspring therefore need to inherit \none allele for the trait from each \nparent. Additionally, the trait can \nskip a generation. This is shown in \nthe diagram on the right. \nIdentifying autosomal dominant traits\nRecall that for dominant traits, \nan individual only needs to have \none copy of the allele. Therefore, \naffected offspring must have \nat least one parent with the \nphenotype.\nIt is possible for two affected \nparents to have an unaffected \nchild. Again, both parents must be heterozygous for this to occur, and the offspring must \ninherit one allele for the normal/unaffected trait from each of them. This is not possible \nif the trait is recessive.\nUsually (but not always, as a mutation would have to occur in the production of sex cells \nfrom one parent), dominant traits will appear in every generation.\nFor both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant traits, there are approximately \n(but not always) equal numbers of males and females affected.aaAa Aa\nA = allele for \u2018normal\u2019 (unaffected) phenotype\na = allele for (affected) phenotype in the pedigree\nAa\naaAa\nA = allele for (affected) phenotype in the pedigree\na = allele for \u2018normal\u2019 (unaffected) phenotypeLINK8B \nINTRODUCTION \nTO GENETICS\nLINK8C MONOHYBRID \nCROSSES\nVIDEO WORKED \nEXAMPLE 8E\u20131\nVIDEO WORKED \nEXAMPLE 8E\u20132\n407 8E PEDIGREES\nISBN 978-1-108-88711-3  \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2021",

The student has been able to appropriately match the written explanation with a diagrammatic representation.\n1.4 \u2018As you can see in Figure 9A\u20133, \nthe genetic material from Sheep A has been fused with the enucleated egg from Sheep B.

It aids the marker in developing a deeper understanding of the process so that the written words are matched with the visual representation in the diagram. This has also demonstrated that the student has a more complex and deeper understanding of the content due to the continued matching of the whole process.\nThese examples do not represent complete responses that you can use in your research \nreport.

The \ndiscovery of penicillin provided a \npotential successful treatment for \nsyphilis, but the problem was that the \ndosage required for effective treatment  \nwas unknown.\nDuring 1946\u20131948, US researchers deliberately infected unsuspecting people in \nGuatemala with the bacterium that causes syphilis.

How broadly or specifically you define your stakeholder will \ndictate how broad or specific the scope of your research will be.\nEthical , social, legal and economic considerations are the four areas you will need to discuss \nwhen outlining the impact of your chosen technology on your stakeholder. Table 9B\u20131 \noutlines each of these considerations. The Skills section on pages 434\u20135 demonstrates \nhow to build connections between these four types of considerations. The difficulty of this \nresearch task lies in how well you can weave the four considerations together while being \nspecific to the context of the stakeholder you have identified.\nTable  9B\u20131  Ethical, social, legal and economic considerations in relation to the impact of technology \non stakeholders\nConsideration Definition Relation to stakeholders\nEthical A sense of right or wrong \nbased upon morals and \nbeliefs in producing or \nobtaining the technologyA range of technologies are available and \nthat gives an individual choice as to what \nservice to use, if any.

You will need \nto conduct further research to understand how each consideration can influence your \nstakeholder in the context of your chosen technology.\nApproaching the ethical consideration\nTo assist you in unpacking the ethical consideration, the Study Design has outlined \napproaches to bioethics and ethical concepts (see tables 9B\u20132 and 9B\u20133). How you \napproach the ethical consideration is an essential element of the research task.

You could \nalso use this process to construct a framework of your own that suits the way you want \nto write.\nStep 1  Pick a central idea to which all factors connect.\nThe ethical consideration has strong links to all the remaining considerations. The social \nsetting, the legal environment and any financial burden influence what is right or wrong. \nAs a result, a good starting point to explore the technolog y is from an ethical point of \nview in the context of your stakeholder.\nThings to consider when exploring the ethical \nconsideration include:\n \u2022Who would benefit from the use of the technology?\n \u2022Who might be harmed by the use of the technology?\n \u2022Is there informed consent and confidentiality?\n \u2022Is the autonomy of individuals being respected?\n \u2022Are the interests of the community being considered \nand respected?\nAs you continue, keep referring back to who is affected and how they are affected.\nStep 2  Explore the next consideration that affects the central idea.\nThe social setting in which the technology is available influences how different \nstakeholders would behave.

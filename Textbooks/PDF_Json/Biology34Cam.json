Examples are shown from the Units 1&2 resource. Users of the award-winning Cambridge Science 7\u201310 for the Victorian Curriculum will recognise some similarities with this senior science resource, including the hosting of the digital material on the Edjin platform, which was developed from Cambridge HOTmaths and is already being used successfully by thousands of teachers and students across Victoria\nPrint book features\nLearning intentions\nIn the Curriculum table at the start of each chapter, the Study Design dot points are translated into Learning Intentions, describing what students should be able to do by the end of the chapter:\nIntr duc ion\nHowever, s me key conce ts in Un ts 1 & 2 are \nun\nexp o e t e s\nucture and f cti n of th  ma n types of s ec a ised organel es.\nt\nmembrane and ow t contr but s to e func ioning of he c ll by egulating the m\nCurriculum\nFrom Unit 1 Area of Study 1 Outcome 1\nCellular structure and function\nStudy Design Learning intentions \u2013 at the end of this chapter I will be able to:\n\u2022 Cells as the basic structural feature of life on Earth, including the distinction between prokaryotic and \neukaryotic cells1A   Plasma membrane1A.1   Recall the four common factors for all organisms\n1A.2    Outline the function of the four common factors for an organismR\nLearning intentions are turned into Success Criteria (achievement \nstandards) at the end of the chapter and are assessed in the Chapter review and tracked in the ChecklistsBlack text indicates the portion of the dot point covered by the section shown in the second column\nWhite text indicates \nthe portion of the dot point covered by other sections\nRelevant Study Design dot points are repeated at the start of each section in the chapter, and an overall \ncurriculum grid is provided in the teacher resources.\nConcept maps\nConcept maps display each chapter\u2019s structure with annotations emphasising interconnectedness, providing a great memory aid. The versions in the ITB are hyperlinked and offer an alternative way of navigating through the course. An overall concept mapof Units 3&4 is also provided after this overview.\nLinks\nThe interconnectedness of topics in Biology is demonstrated through links between sections, displayed in the margins. In the ITB, these are hyperlinks that provide an alternative way of navigating through the course.Concept map\nGenetic mater alCommon features of all\nl v ng things\nMain structural\nproperties of the\np asma membrane\nEukaryotic ProkaryoticR bosome\nCytosol\nP asma membrane\nExp oring structure\nand function of\ninternal organs\nof the cell\nGenetic\n1C Membrane transportDif erent substances move nto and out of the cell by di ferent\nprocesses across d fferent parts of he plasma membrane\n1A Plasma membrane 1B Cell types and cell organellesThe ty\nu  exp g b o d\n m hon a p v g\nfor th  c ll  Th  se ret ry c lls that line th  stom ch are p rt of th  dig stive system d \nh  r q r ny o g pp n b  re y a d in \nr akd wn of f od m l cu e\n     Check- n questi ns Set 3  \n     1  What s  organel e\n   2  Pr d n a t f h i ll  f k\n Comparison of plant and animal cells \n Plant cells and animal cells have many organelles in common, but there are some differences ( Figure 1B\u20136 ). \n A misconception is that plant cells only perform photosynthesis and do not respire. In fact, \nplant cells perform both photosynthesis and cellular respiration, and so a plant cell has both mitochondria and chloroplasts. Not all the cells in a plant photosynthesise (for example, root cells do not photosynthesise), but they do all have a cell wall. In contrast, animal cells do not have any chloroplasts, and do not photosynthesise. osRibiliumr a t\nR bosomes\nSmoo\nNuclear\nC l wall\nb\no\ng pp atus Ves c eh\nendop a m c\nNucle\nough\nMi hond ion\nytopla m o e eg\napp a usc\n   F gur  1B 5  G n l d a  p e , rg a l\nLINK   5A \nPHOTOSYNTHESIS \nLINK  5C  CELLULAR \nRESPIRATION  O E\n1B 2 D19 AN CELL AN LL S\nvi",

But how do you know whether something is living or not? In junior science, you learned the acronym MRSGREN \n(movement, reproduction, sensitivity, growth, respiration, excretion, nutrition). In VCE Biology, different criteria are used to distinguish between living and non-living.

In that section, the STRICTER approach was used to explain the steps involved in negative feedback loops. In this section, a number of physiological examples of negative feedback loops were discussed: regulation of body temperature, regulation of blood glucose levels and regulation of water balance. All these processes involve the same general steps associated with negative feedback loops, and so the STRICTER approach is still valid.\n              \n            \n   \n         \n           \n             \n   \n                   \nENGAGE\nThe largest living things\nWhat is the biggest organism  on Earth?

They are made of proteins, which are coded for by an organism\u2019s DNA, and they are specific to the substance they act on.\n2 The enzyme catalase reacts with the substrate hydrogen peroxide (H\n2O2), breaking it down into water and oxygen (products) in a \ncatabolic reaction. Catalase is primarily found in the liver and is important in protecting the organism from damage caused by \nhydrogen peroxide, which is constantly produced by mammals.Introduction \na detailed but succinct explanation of the reason for undertaking an investigation; includes key biological concepts, aim and hypothesis26 e des gn\u2022Chapter 12 Scientific\ninvestigations repeatsmodelling of logbookdevelopment for students\u2019own practical investigations,with detailed examples, fromChapter 6 in the Units 1&2resource.

This was the largest collection to date globally of fossilised footprints in a single find, and some of the oldest \u2013 dating estimated the  to be from 20 000 years ago.\nToday, the Paakantji, Mutthi Mutthi and Ngyimpaa people continue to maintain a close \nconnection to the now World Heritage-listed Willandra Lakes, which include Lake Mungo. An important Connection to Country for Aboriginal Australians and part of their communal history was the return of the remains of Mungo Lady (in 1992) and Mungo Man (in 2017)  \nFigure 11B\u20137 The return of Mungo Man in 2017 to the Paakantji, Mutthi Mutthi and Ngyimpaa people (left) was marked \nwith a traditional Aboriginal ceremony (right).\nConnection to Country\nA population\u2019s interaction with their environment can also be referred to as Connection to \nCountry . This was (and still is) an important way of life for Indigenous populations in the \nPacific region, specifically that of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.\nIt is understood that Aboriginal Australians have the longest unbroken record of ancient \nart. For their ancestors, creating art would have been a way of forming a greater connection between each other, and also a way to define their unique identity among other populations.\nThe transmission of this information and key \ncultural practices within and between generations would not have been possible without an increase in brain volume and the development of key regions of the brain. Therefore, the use of language, in both a verbal and an artistic sense, is a key component of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders\u2019 way of life. Current generations have continued to inherit this cultural understanding and the practices of their ancestors, continuing to add to this record.\nConsider how the ancestors of these Indigenous \npopulations would have used the key developments in hominin evolution (outlined in Table 11B\u20132) to \nenhance their survival and way of life.Connection to \nCountry the relationship between people and their indigenous land or environment\nFigure 11B\u20135 An example of artwork found in Quinkan \ncountry, Queensland, featuring images of humans,  dingoes and eels.

  "Page 14": "HOW DO CELLS MAINTAIN LIFE?\nIntroduction\nFor Units 3 & 4 Biology, it is not a requirement that you have completed Units 1 and/or 2. \nHowever, some key concepts in Units 1 & 2 are fundamental to understanding the processes studied in the Units 3 & 4 course. Even if you have done Units 1 & 2, you can use this chapter to revise those key concepts.\nThis chapter examines cells as the basic structural feature of life on Earth. Prokaryotes (such as \nbacteria) and eukaryotes (such as plants and animals) are the two main cell types, and being able to distinguish between them is an important skill. You will understand that all cells have four common features \u2013 genetic material, plasma membrane, cytosol and ribosomes \u2013 and you will explore the structure and function of the main types of specialised organelles.\nA considerable portion of this chapter focuses closely on the structure and function of the plasma \nmembrane and how it contributes to the functioning of the cell by regulating the movement of substances into and out of the cell. These substances are crucial to processes that will be explored throughout this book, including protein synthesis, photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and immunity.\nCurriculum\nFrom Unit 1 Area of Study 1 Outcome 1\nCellular structure and function\nStudy Design Learning intentions \u2013 at the end of this chapter I will be able to:\n\u2022 Cells as the basic structural feature of life on Earth, including the distinction between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells1A \n  Plasma membrane\n1A.1   Recall the four common factors for all organisms\n1A.2    Outline the function of the four common factors for an organismUNIT \n3 \nKEY BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE \nREQUIRED FOR UNITS 3&4CHAPTER \n1\n2\n",

It is \na semi-permeable membrane  that allows substances to be transported between the internal \nand external environments of the cell. It consists of a phospholipid bilayer, proteins, carbohydrates and cholesterol.\nThe functions of the plasma membrane include but are not limited to:\n \u2022recognising other cells when forming tissue, or determining whether cells are foreign \nduring an immune response\n \u2022communicating with other cells\n \u2022selectively controlling which substances are transported into or out of the cell.\nThe process of transporting substances across the plasma membrane is explored in detail in \nSection 1C.\nThe phospholipid bilayer is arranged with the hydrophobic  (water-repelling) tails facing \ninwards and the hydrophilic  (water-attracting) heads on the outsides of the membrane, \ntowards the watery internal and external environments. Because the plasma membrane \nis made up of phospholipids, it is able to selectively allow different substances to enter and leave the cell. Water-soluble (hydrophilic) substances need the assistance of a protein channel to cross the phospholipid part of the membrane.

Referring to plasma membranes in this way is known as the \nfluid mosaic model  (see Figure 1A\u20135 on \nthe previous page).\nRecall that a phospholipid consists of a head and two tails, and the tails consist of fatty \nacids. If these fatty acids are saturated, they have only one bond between each carbon atom, and this makes them pack together tightly. If there are unsaturated fatty acids in the tails, they have double bonds between some carbon atoms and this makes them pack together less tightly. So more unsaturated fatty acids in the tails of the phospholipids increases the fluidity of the plasma membrane (Figure 1A\u20136).Fluid mosaic \nmodel a model that represents the plasma membrane as a combination (mosaic) of phospholipids, proteins, cholesterol and carbohydrates that gives the membrane its fluid nature\nHO C CO\nHC CHH\nHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\nC C C C C C HSaturated fatty acid\nUnsaturated fatty acidSaturated lipid Saturated lipids only\nUnsaturated lipidHOC CO\nHC CHH\nHH\nHH\nHH HH\nHH\nHH\nHC CC C\nC C\nH\nMixed saturated and\nunsaturated lipids\nFigure 1A\u20136 Double bonds between carbon atoms in unsaturated fatty acids cause the carbon chain \nto kink.

For a successful reaction, the molecules need to move into and around the cell at the correct rate. They also need to be in the correct concentration for specific chemical reactions to occur.\nA eukaryotic cell is relatively large, making it more difficult for chemical reactions to occur \nefficiently within it. This problem is overcome by having smaller compartments within the cell. Organelles are membrane-bound compartments within a cell that perform specific functions. Each organelle (with the exception of ribosomes) has a plasma membrane.

  "Page 36": "EXPLAIN\nThe nature of substances\nWhat makes understanding the movement of substances challenging is that they do not all \nhave the same characteristics. The molecules of some substances are large, some are small, some are charged and some uncharged, some are \npolar , some dissolve in water (hydrophilic) \nand others dissolve in lipids ( lipophilic ).\nAs you progress through this chapter, you will see that several terms can be used interchangeably. For example, substances that dissolve readily in water (and do not dissolve readily in lipids) can be described as hydrophilic or \nlipophobic . In the same way, substances \nthat dissolve readily in lipids (and do not dissolve readily in water) can be described as lipophilic or hydrophobic.\nThe different characteristics of the substances being transported mean that these \nsubstances require different ways of transport across the plasma membrane. It is the different components of the plasma membrane that allow this to happen.\nStructural elements of the plasma membrane\nIn Section 1A, the characteristics of the plasma membrane were described. These include the phospholipid bilayer, proteins, carbohydrate chains and cholesterol. Movement through the plasma membrane occurs through two of these structural elements:\n \u2022Phospholipid bilayer\n \u25b6Lipophilic (hydrophobic) substances move freely through the phospholipid bilayer due to the hydrophobic nature of the fatty acid tails of phospholipids.\n \u25b6Water, gases, and other small hydrophobic molecules can diffuse directly across the phospholipid bilayer.\n \u2022Protein channels/carriers\n \u25b6Polar or hydrophilic substances pass through the channel proteins and carrier proteins.\nIt is these structural elements that allow the plasma membrane to be selective about what moves from one side of the plasma membrane to the other. Therefore, the plasma membrane is referred to as being semi-permeable, or partially \npermeable , selectively \npermeable or differentially permeable.Polar \ndescribes a molecule that has different charged sides (\u2018poles\u2019) and dissolves in water, which is also a polar substance\nLipophilic \ndissolves easily in lipids; also called hydrophobic\nNOTE\nHydrophilic comes from hydro, which means water, and philic, which means loving.

Diffusion \nis a type of passive transport, which means it does not require energy. It occurs naturally \nin both living and non-living systems. In living systems, diffusion can take place across a plasma membrane, as long as the molecule can pass through the hydrophobic fatty acid tails of the phospholipid bilayer.

Because diffusion is necessary for a cell to survive, the cell requires optimal conditions so that diffusion is as efficient as possible. Table 1C\u20132 summarises the main factors that can affect the rate of diffusion.\nTable 1C\u20132 Factors that affect the rate of diffusion\nFactor How diffusion is affected\nSize The smaller the molecules of a substance, the higher the rate of diffusion.\nConcentration The greater the difference in concentration between the two regions \n(known as a concentration gradient ), the higher the rate of diffusion.\nTemperature The higher the temperature, the higher the rate of diffusion.

Did you notice the difference compared to the definition of diffusion? Osmosis is all about the movement of free water. Just like diffusion (because it is the diffusion of water), osmosis is a passive process that requires no input of energy (ATP) to occur.\nIn Figure 1C\u20136, there are sugar molecules and water molecules on both sides of the semi-\npermeable membrane, which runs down the centre. In the left image, note where the lowest and highest concentration of sugar molecules are. However they are too big to pass across the membrane. Also note where the lowest and highest concentration of free water molecules are. Which way will they diffuse (by osmosis) across the membrane? Now compare the left image with the right image.

  "Page 40": "The free water has moved across the semi-permeable membrane from a region of high \nfree water concentration to low free water concentration until evenly distributed on both sides: this is osmosis. Notice that the sugar molecules have not moved, despite there being a difference in the concentration on each side (concentration gradient). This is because the sugar molecules are too large to move through this membrane.\nNote that when there is a high concentration of free water molecules in a solution, the \nsolution has a low concentration of solute and is called dilute. If there is a low concentration of free water molecules in a solution, there is a comparatively higher concentration of solute and therefore the solution is said to be concentrated. In VCE, there are two definitions for osmosis: one refers to free water, as discussed above, and one refers to the solute concentration. In an examination situation, both definitions are equally acceptable as long as you don\u2019t get them confused. So the alternative definition for osmosis is:\nOsmosis is the net passive movement of free water from a region of low solute concentration to a region of high solute concentration across a semi-permeable membrane until equilibrium is reached.\nLow free water\nconcentrationLow solute\nconcentrationHigh free water\nconcentrationSolution 1 Solution 2\nHigh soluteconcentration\nFigure 1C\u20137 Solutions can be described in two ways: by their water concentration or by their solute \nconcentration.\nCheck-in questions \u2013 Set 2\n1  Define osmosis.\n2  How could you define osmosis another way?\n3  List two similarities and two differences between diffusion and osmosis.\nTonicity\nWater is the medium in which many of the chemical processes of cells take place. This is \nbecause it is an excellent solvent and can therefore transport a lot of substances (solutes), as water moves easily through the plasma membrane. As a consequence, the water content of the solution outside a cell (the cell\u2019s external environment), will affect the conditions inside the cell (the cell\u2019s internal environment). This is called \ntonicity . Tonicity means that the \nconcentration of solutes dissolved in an extracellular solution can determine the direction and rate of osmosis, and therefore the volume of a cell.Tonicity \nhow the concentration of solutes dissolved in an extracellular solution determines the direction and rate of osmosis and therefore the volume of a cell\n28\nCHAPTER 1 KEY BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED FOR UNITS 3&4\n",

Like passive transport, active transport is a selective process for moving substances across a membrane, and it occurs in living cells. However, active transport uses energy, in the form of \nATP (adenosine triphosphate) , as the substances are moved from a \nregion of low substance concentration to a region of high substance concentration. This is the reverse of the way substances naturally move and become distributed. You will look at ATP and its role as an energy shuttle in more detail in Chapter 5.\nActive transport is a protein-mediated process, just like facilitated diffusion. Every plasma \nmembrane contains special protein carriers, also called protein pumps, which use ATP as a fuel for the pump. Some protein carriers transport one substance and some transport two substances simultaneously, but all are specific for certain substances, and in this way they are able to regulate the movement of that substance. This is why active transport is considered to be a selective process. Figure 1C\u201311 shows the selective nature of the protein carrier and how, during the transport process, the protein carrier changes shape.ATP (adenosine \ntriphosphate) the main immediate source of chemical energy in a cell, powering most cellular processes; when a phosphate group is removed, energy is released and ADP is formed\nATP\nFigure 1C\u201311 Active transport is a selective process in which substances \nare moved from a region of low concentration to a region of high concentration.

Bulk transport is the \nmovement of large particles (or large volumes of liquids) through the plasma membrane, requiring the input of energy (ATP). As the process requires ATP, it is classified as a form of active transport.\nBulk transport operates differently from other transport processes. It is \nvesicle mediated \ntransport , which means it uses membrane-bound structures. This is why cholesterol is such \nan important component of the plasma membrane \u2013 it allows the membrane to be broken \nand remade as substances enter and leave the cell, avoiding the need for a substance to cross through a particular component of the plasma membrane.\nThe two main types of bulk transport are \nendocytosis  and exocytosis .

Since 1953, when Francis Crick, James \nWatson, Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin discovered the double helix structure of DNA, we have been fascinated by DNA and how our understanding of it can help us in many aspects of life. Indeed, think about all the ways that we now use our knowledge of DNA every day. It is a key part of forensics, in helping identify criminals and solve crimes, or in paternity disputes. We use it to overcome fertility problems and help couples have children. We can harness it to generate large quantities of medical products, such as insulin. Most importantly, by coding for proteins, DNA acts as the genetic blueprint that makes all organisms unique and allows them to function. This chapter investigates nucleic acids and proteins, as well as the processes through which the information contained within the genetic code is converted into proteins. It also looks at how gene expression is regulated in cells, with a focus on a specific prokaryotic example.\nCurriculum\nArea of Study 1 Outcome 1\nThe relationship between nucleic acids and proteins\nStudy Design Learning intentions \u2013 at the end of this chapter I will be able to: \n\u2022 Nucleic acids as information molecules that encode instructions for\u00a0the synthesis of proteins: the \nstructure of DNA,\u00a0the three forms of RNA (mRNA, rRNA and tRNA) and\n \na comparison of their respective nucleotides2A \n  Nucleic acids\n2A.1   List the differences between DNA and RNA\n2A.2   Draw schematic diagrams of a nucleotide, a single strand and a double strand of nucleic acid\n2A.3 \n  State the differences between mRNA, rRNA and tRNA\n2A.4  Describe how information is encoded in DNA and instructs protein synthesis\n\u2022\n The genetic code as a universal triplet code that is degenerate and the steps in gene expression, including transcription, RNA processing in eukaryotic cells and translation by ribosomes2B \n  The genetic code and gene expression\n2B.1   Describe the steps involved in transcription\n2B.2   Describe the steps involved in processing pre-mRNA to \nmRNA\n2B.3   Describe the steps involved in translation\n2B.4   Draw a schematic diagram showing all parts of protein synthesis\n2B.5 \n  Define what is meant by degeneracy in the universal triplet code\n2B.6 \n  Convert a DNA sequence to an mRNA sequence and then, using a codon table, to an amino acid sequenceUNIT \n3 \nFROM DNA TO PROTEINSCHAPTER \n2\n42\nISBN 978-1-108-89462-3 \n  stricted under law and this materia        \n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2",

One of those \nfactors is the ability to store and pass on genetic material. The biomolecules that contain all this information are known as nucleic acids. Nucleic acids are found in two forms: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). You may have heard people discuss nucleic acids in various ways, without realising that this was what they were referring to. Phrases such as \u2018You are a combination of your Mum and your Dad\u2019 or \u2018It\u2019s all about genetics\u2019 refer to the function that DNA (and nucleic acids in general) has in our body.

In this process, shown in Figure 2A\u20131, organisms convert the information contained within their genetic material (in the form of nucleic acids) into functional molecules (in the form of proteins).\nHowever, you first need to study nucleic acids. This section examines the similarities and \ndifferences between these molecules, as well as their structure and function.VIDEO 2A\u20131 \nINTRODUCING NUCLEIC ACIDS\nLINK2B THE GENETIC CODE AND GENE EXPRESSION\n45 2A NuCLEIC  ACIDS\nISBN 978-1-108-89462-3 \n  stricted under law and this materia        \n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2",
  "Page 58": "Differences between DNA and RNA\nDNA and RNA have many similarities. Both are made up of long strands ( polymer ) \nof a repeating unit ( monomer ) made from a sugar and a phosphate group, each with a \nnitrogenous base sticking out to the side. This monomer is called a nucleotide .The sugar \ngroup of one unit joins the phosphate group of another, to form a long chain, informally \ncalled the sugar\u2013phosphate \u2018backbone\u2019 (Figure 2A\u20131).\nIt is important to also be able to recognise the differences between DNA and RNA. There \nare three main points of distinction, which you can remember using the acronym SBS (sugar, bases, strands):1 \n Sugar: as their names indicate, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) contains deoxyribose sugars, while RNA (ribonucleic acid) contains ribose sugars. As shown in Figure 2A\u20132, deoxyribose has one less oxygen atom than ribose.\n2 \n  Nitrogenous bases: these are almost the same in both DNA and RNA. Both have \ncytosine (C), guanine (G) and adenine (A). However, each also possesses a unique base. In DNA, it is thymine (T). In RNA, it is uracil (U).

Pyrimidines always bond to purines, and vice versa.3   Sugar\u2013phosphate strands: DNA is double-\nstranded, whereas RNA forms only a single \nstrand.

  "Page 59": "Structure of DNA\nDNA has probably the best known structure of any biological molecule. The double helix \nis instantly recognisable as that of DNA. However, before looking at this, you first need to understand the building blocks of DNA. Many molecules in our body, such as DNA, carbohydrates and proteins (which will be discussed later in this chapter), are polymers. A polymer is a molecule that is made up of many smaller, repeating units linked together. Each of these smaller individual units is called a monomer.\nFormation of the monomer\nIn DNA, the monomers (building blocks) are known as nucleotides. Each nucleotide is made up of three components: a sugar, a phosphate group and a nitrogenous base. As mentioned earlier, in DNA this nitrogenous base can be adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) or thymine (T).\nFormation of the polymer\nThese monomers join together to form a single strand of DNA, via bonds between the  sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next nucleotide (Figure 2A\u20134). As shown in this diagram, one end of the single strand ends with a phosphate, and is known as the  5\u2032 (pronounced \u2018five prime\u2019) end. The other end finishes with a sugar, and is known as the  3\u2032 (pronounced \u2018three prime\u2019) end.\nN\nN\nN5\u2019\n4\u2019\n3\u2019\n2\u20191\u2019N\nN\nN\nN\nNN\nON\nN\nN\nN\nN\nNNHN\nHN\nNH\nNHN\nN5\u00b4 endGuanineSugar\u2013phosphate backbone\nThymine\nAdenineCytosineHydrogen bond\n5\u00b4 end3\u00b4 end\n3\u00b4 endNH2CH3\nCH3NH2\nNH2H2 NN\nO\nO\nO\nO\nOHH2 N\nH2 NO\nOOO\nOOO\nOPOH\nO\nOO\nOOO\nOO\nNOOO\nOO\nOOO\nOONucleotide\nP\nP\nPO\nOO\nO\nO\nOO\nO\nO\nO\nOO\nO\nO\nO\nOOP\nP\nP\nPPPS Figure 2A\u20134 The structure of DNA. \nEach strand is held together by bonds \nbetween the phosphate group and the \nsugar group.

  "Page 60": "As discussed earlier, one of the defining characteristics of DNA is that it is double-stranded. \nThe two strands are joined by hydrogen bonds between complementary  nitrogenous bases.\nThese nitrogenous bases cannot join randomly. Each base is only able to partner with one other base. In DNA, the complementary base pairs are arranged as follows: adenine bonds to thymine (A\u2013T), and guanine bonds to cytosine (G\u2013C). Note from Figure 2A\u20135 that a different number of hydrogen bonds holds each of the two pairs of bases together: adenine and thymine are joined by two hydrogen bonds, whereas guanine and cytosine are joined by three. For this reason, DNA segments that contain a higher percentage of G\u2013C pairs are stronger and harder to break apart.\nThink about the fact that adenine always pairs with thymine, and what consequence this \nhas for the amount of adenine and thymine in a DNA molecule. Consider whether the same would be true for cytosine and guanine. If there are 1000 adenine and 800 cytosine bases in a DNA molecule, how many thymine and guanine bases will there be?

You might be asked to compare the different types of nucleic acids (DNA vs RNA) or the different types of RNA (mRNA vs rRNA vs tRNA). Although comparison questions may seem straightforward, students often don\u2019t receive full marks for their answer. The main reason for this is that students often interpret the question as follows:\nQuestion:\nCompare the structures of DNA and RNA.Interpretation:List the differences between DNA and RNA.\nA comparison question requires you to answer it in two parts. First, you have to discuss \nthe aspects that are similar between the two items, then you have to analyse the aspects that are different. This is the best way to ensure that you get maximum marks for a comparison-style question. Keep your comparisons succinct and do not repeat the question. Let\u2019s use the example above to look at ways to approach this type of question.\nQuestion:\nCompare the structures of DNA and RNA.Answer \u2013 strategy 1:Group your responses by similarities and differences.Similarities:\n \u2022Both are made up of nucleotides containing a sugar, a phosphate and a \nnitrogenous base.\nDifferences (make it clear that there is a comparison, by using terms such as \u2018whereas\u2019, \u2018although\u2019, \u2018in contrast\u2019 and \u2018unlike\u2019):\n \u2022DNA has thymine, whereas RNA has uracil.\n \u2022DNA is double stranded, whereas RNA is single stranded.\n \u2022DNA has deoxyribose sugar, whereas RNA has ribose.\nAnswer \u2013 strategy 2:\nDraw a table listing key features and the responses for each item.\nDNA RNA\nStrands Double Single\nMonomer Nucleotide Nucleotide\nBases A, T, C, G A, U, C, G\nSugar Deoxyribose Ribose\nAs you can see, using either strategy helps ensure that your answer is complete and \nthorough.

  "Page 65": "EXPLAIN\nTranscription: DNA to mRNA\nGene expression  is the conversion of the genetic code within the DNA of a gene sequence \ninto the functional unit known as a protein (protein synthesis). Recall Figure 2A\u20131 in the \nprevious section for an overall picture of the information conversion process. Transcription  \nis the first step of protein synthesis. In eukaryotes, transcription occurs in the nucleus and involves transforming DNA into pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). In everyday usage, the term \u2018transcription\u2019 means the act of taking some information and writing it down \u2013 so, the information is the code in the DNA, and it is \u2018written down\u2019 as an mRNA sequence. An mRNA molecule can therefore be referred to as a transcript. Let\u2019s look in detail at the steps involved.\n1 Separating the double-helix strands of DNA\nAs you learned in Section 2A, DNA is a double-stranded molecule. The two strands are held together by hydrogen bonds connecting the complementary base pairs.\nTherefore, separating the DNA double helix requires the action of an \nenzyme  called RNA \npolymerase. For RNA polymerase to function correctly, it must first bind to a specific \nregion in the gene, known as the promoter . You will learn more about the specific structure \nof a gene in Section 2D.\n2 Copying the DNA code to create RNA\nOnce bound to the promoter, the RNA polymerase connects free RNA nucleotides to make a strand of \u2018pre-mRNA\u2019 that is complementary to one of the separated strands of the DNA, called the template strand. Calling it \u2018pre-mRNA\u2019 indicates that more processing is needed before it becomes \u2018mature\u2019 mRNA.Gene expression \nconversion of the code in DNA of a gene into a protein through protein synthesis\nTranscription \nthe process through which DNA is converted to messenger RNA (mRNA) and the genetic code in the DNA is copied to the mRNA\nLINK2D GENE \nSTRUCTURE AND EXPRESSION\nEnzyme \na type of protein, also referred to as a biological catalyst, that speeds up reactions within an organism by lowering activation energy\nPromoter \nthe region of a gene at which RNA polymerase binds, to initiate transcription\nVIDEO 2B\u20131 \nFROM DNA TO PROTEINWORKSHEET 2B\u20131 TRANSCRIPTION AND TRANSLATION\nDOC\nNOTE\nThe nucleotide sequence (code) of the pre-mRNA is the same as that of the other strand of DNA, \nthe one not being transcribed, except that the nitrogenous base uracil substitutes for thymine.

  "Page 67": "Translation: mRNA to protein\nOnce RNA processing has been completed, the mature mRNA then exits the nucleus \nthrough nuclear pores and travels to a ribosome. It is here, at the ribosome, that the protein will be synthesised using the information (code) in the mRNA, through a process called \ntranslation . In everyday use, a translation is the conversion of information from one \nlanguage into another. Here it is used to mean the conversion of the information in mRNA into a sequence of amino acids making up a specific protein.\nRecall from Section 1B that ribosomes exist in two places within the cell: as free ribosomes in the cytosol or attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. While protein synthesis can occur in both locations, the proteins formed serve different purposes. Proteins synthesised at free ribosomes are for use within that cell, whereas those produced on the rough endoplasmic reticulum will be secreted to complete their function outside the cell.\nMessenger RNA binds to \nribosomes and transfer RNA\nFor the process to begin, the mRNA \nbinds to the ribosome. Once attached to the ribosome, the other crucial molecule involved in translation, the transfer RNA or tRNA, is able to commence its role. The structure of a tRNA molecule can be seen in Figure 2B\u20134. There are two key areas to focus on. First, it can be seen that the tRNA binds to the mRNA through three complementary bases. The three bases found on the mRNA are referred to as the \ncodon , whereas \nthe complementary three bases on the tRNA are called the \nanticodon .\nAt the other end of the tRNA, an amino \nacid is attached. This amino acid is \nspecific to the codon on the mRNA. When two tRNA molecules bind next to each other on the mRNA, their amino acids can be joined, and joining many amino acids together forms the initial structure of a protein, called the primary structure or polypeptide chain.\nNearly all organisms share the same \ngenetic coding system, based on the three nucleotide codons. This is referred to as the \nuniversal triplet code .Translation \nthe process through which the information in mRNA is converted into a sequence of amino acids to synthesise a protein\nLINK1B CELL TYPES \nAND CELL ORGANELLESCSpecific amino acid\ndetermined by\nmRNA codon\ntRNA\nmRNAAnticodon\nCodonUUU\nG\nG\nGG\nA\nACG\nAA C\nCC\nUUU\nG\nGG\nAA C\nCC\nFigure 2B\u20134 The structure of transfer RNA (tRNA) with a \nstrand of mRNA beneath it, to which it binds as shown at the bottom.

  "Page 68": "Transfer RNA links \namino acids to form peptides\nFigure 2B\u20135 gives an \noverview of translation. In (1), the first tRNA anticodon binds to the mRNA codon (three bases at a time). A second tRNA attaches to the next codon and there are now two amino acids next to each other. (In this example MET is methionine, LYS is lysine. In (2), the amino acids are joined by a bond (more detail of this is in Section 2C). At this point, there are two tRNA molecules attached to the mRNA. However, it is only possible for two tRNA molecules to be attached to the mRNA at any one time. In (3), the ribosome slides along the mRNA until the next codon is in position to interact with the third tRNA. Before this can happen the first tRNA must detach from the mRNA, but must leave its amino acid attached the next one or the process of protein synthesis would not work. So the amino acid bond must be made before it can detach. (4) The process repeats until a polypeptide chain, part of a protein is formed.

This feature is referred to as degenerate  or redundant genetic code. \nWhile this may not seem useful, it is actually important for the survival of organisms. Can you think why this may be the case?\nThe answer lies in the fact that \nmutations  (spontaneous changes in the DNA sequence) can \noccur quite frequently. Considering this, imagine that every amino acid had only one triplet \nsequence that coded for it. As soon as any mutation occurred in the DNA sequence, it would result in the amino acid sequence of the protein changing. Degenerate \ndescribes a genetic code in which multiple codons code for the same amino acid; also referred to as redundant\nMutation a permanent change in the nucleotide sequence of a section of DNACodons and the amino acids they represent\nAs mentioned previously, each set of three bases in the mRNA sequence represents a \ncodon, and the sequence of the codon determines the amino acid that will be added to that position in the polypeptide chain. The sequences of the codons and the amino acids that they represent can be illustrated in a codon table, as shown in Figure 2B\u20136. It is important that you know how to read this table, as questions will commonly ask you to determine the amino acid sequence based on a given mRNA sequence. The codon table is always provided, so you do not need to memorise this.\n57 2B THE GENETI C CODE  AND GENE  EXPRES SION\nISBN 978-1-108-89462-3 \n  stricted under law and this materia        \n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2",
  "Page 70": "Altering the amino acid sequence of a protein could change its overall structure, which \ncould have catastrophic effects on the organism. Indeed, this is the case with sickle cell anaemia, which results from just a single base mutation. Thankfully, due to the degenerate genetic code, this outcome is rare. In fact, some studies have suggested that more than 99% of all mutations don\u2019t lead to any change in the amino acid sequence. As these types of alterations have no impact, they are referred to as \u2018silent mutations\u2019. The concept of mutations is covered in more detail in Section 9A.\nCheck-in questions \u2013 Set 2\n1  What is the difference between transcription and translation?\n2  What events happen between transcription and translation?\n3  What are a codon and an anticodon?\n4  One of the codons for the amino acid valine is GUC.

These processes are very similar in prokaryotic cells, although with some differences. Prokaryotic cells lack a membrane-bound nucleus. Instead, their nucleic acid is contained within the cytosol and is known as the nucleoid. For this reason, both transcription and translation occur within the cytosol. Therefore, one of the key differences of protein synthesis in prokaryotic cells is that there is no clear differentiation between these steps. In fact, in prokaryotic cells, the mRNA begins to be translated even while transcription is still ongoing. An example of this is shown in Figure 2B\u20137. Similarly, you can see in this diagram that (as discussed earlier in this section), transcription in eukaryotes results in two products: initially pre-mRNA, which then undergoes processing to make the final mature mRNA. In prokaryotic cells, RNA processing does not occur. This makes sense when you remember that this product of transcription is immediately and simultaneously translated into protein.LINK 9A MUTATIONS\nmRNAPlasma membrane\nDNA\nMature\nmRNANucleus\nPre-mRNA\nNuclear\npore\nRibosomesProteinCytosolCytosolNuclear\nmembranePlasma membrane\nProtein Ribosomes\nProkaryotic cell\nEukaryotic cellDNA\nFigure 2B\u20137 Transcription and translation in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells\n58\nCHAPTER 2 FROM DNA TO PROTEINS\nISBN 978-1-108-89462-3 \n  stricted under law and this materia        \n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2",
  "Page 71": "2B SKILLS\nAnnotating diagrams\nWhen describing processes like transcription and translation, it can be helpful to use diagrams. However, while these drawings can be very useful, it is important that you annotate them concisely, accurately and appropriately. There are a number of techniques that you can use to do this. One technique is discussed here.\nA useful first step is to write a one-sentence description of what happens at each stage. \nThis will help you to order your thoughts and think about what your diagram needs to represent. Also, the sentences can form the basis of the annotations that you use for each diagram. Make your notes brief and succinct.\nLet\u2019s look at how you might do this for transcription.\nQuestion :\nUse an annotated diagram to outline the process of transcription.\nFirst write a brief statement for each step. For example:\nStep 1 RNA polymerase binds to the promoter.\nStep 2  RNA polymerase unwinds the double helix and joins free RNA nucleotides to make a complementary pre-mRNA copy of the template strand.\nStep 3 RNA polymerase reaches the terminator, causing transcription to stop.\nNote that technically the processing of pre-mRNA into mRNA and the exiting of the RNA out of the nucleus are not part of transcription, so should not be included.\nYou can then use these steps as signposts for the series of images that you want to \ncreate, and as the text to annotate the images. Below is an\n example of what you might do \nfor Step 1.\nRNA polymerase binds\nto the promoter\nGene X\nPromoterDNA P\nThere are two final things to note about using diagrams and annotating them correctly. First, you do not need to draw an impressive work of art for your diagram to communicate your answer effectively. As shown in the diagram above, you can use a very simple illustration that includes basic shapes for the key elements of the process that you are drawing. Second, clearly indicate the part of your drawing that the annotation refers to. As you can see in the example, it is very easy to use an arrow to highlight the important part at each stage. It may be a worthwhile practice exercise for you to now complete this process using Steps 2 and 3 as a guide.VIDEO 2B\u20132 \nSKILLS: ANNOTATING DIAGRAMS\n59 2B THE GENETI C CODE  AND GENE  EXPRES SION\nISBN 978-1-108-89462-3 \n  stricted under law and this materia        \n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2",

A carboxyl group can also be referred to as a carboxylic acid, and so the term \u2018amino acid\u2019 is derived from these two components: amino (\u2013NH\n2) and acid (\u2013COOH).DOC WORKSHEET \n2C\u20131 PROTEINS\nLINK2B THE GENETIC \nCODE AND GENE \nEXPRESSION\nPPSPolypeptide \na long chain of amino acids forming part of a proteinPeptide bond a chemical bond between two amino acids\n62\nCHAPTER 2 FROM DNA TO PROTEINS\nISBN 978-1-108-89462-3 \n  stricted under law and this materia        \n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2",

Have you ever \nstopped to think about how much genetic material you have in your body? The Human Genome Project found that the total length of the human genome is over 3 billion base pairs. Contained within that huge amount of information are an estimated 20\n 000\u2013\n25 000 genes. Remember from Section 2C that genes are the coding information used to \nsynthesise proteins. Recent estimations have suggested that between 80  000 and 400  000 \nproteins are made within the human body. Considering the complexity of this (3 billion base pairs, 25\n 000 genes and more than 80  000 proteins), how does it all work without \nproblems arising all the time? The answer lies in the structure of genes and how it relates to their expression. This is covered in depth in this section.\nEXPLAIN\nUnderstanding the structure of genes\nTo understand the structure of genes, think about the structure of your favourite book or movie. Any good story or film has a beginning, a middle and an end. In the middle, there are parts of the plot that are important, and sometimes there are parts that just seem to  be \u2018filling in time\u2019. In essence, the structure of genes in eukaryotic cells is the same.  Figure 2D\u20131 shows the overall structure of a eukaryotic gene. We will look at those components of a gene separately and discuss the role played by each.\nPromoterIntrons\nTerminator Operator Exons\nFigure 2D\u20131 The generalised structure of a eukaryotic gene, which comprises a promoter, \nan operator, introns, exons and a terminator.\nPromoter: the beginning of the story\nIn Section 2B the underlying process of going from DNA to protein was described. \nRemember that, for this to occur, the gene encoding the protein must be converted from DNA to messenger RNA (mRNA), through a process known as transcription. As you may recall, the process of transcription starts with a promoter. The promoter is the binding site for RNA polymerase, the enzyme that moves along the DNA template strand, producing a complementary pre-mRNA strand.LINK2B THE GENETIC \nCODE AND GENE EXPRESSIONLINK2A NUCLEIC ACIDS\nLINK 2C PROTEINS\nWORKSHEET \n2D\u20131 GENE STRUCTURE AND OPERONSDOC\n69 2D GENE STRuCTuRE AND EXPRESSION\n",
  "Page 82": "Introns and exons: the coding region (the middle of the story)\nIntrons and exons are what is transcribed from the DNA into pre-mRNA during the \nprocess of transcription (Figure 2D\u20132). Together, introns and exons form the protein \ncoding region  of DNA. As shown in Figure 2D\u20132, there is an additional step that occurs after \nDNA is transcribed into pre-mRNA, which is the processing to mature mRNA (covered in Section 2B). However, what is important to note is that the introns do not feature in the final mRNA product. This is because introns do not actually contain any of the sequence related to the genetic code for the protein. Introns are the intervening sequences (or interruptions) found between exons. They have previously been referred to as \u2018junk DNA\u2019, but it is likely that they serve other purposes that we are not yet fully aware of. Exons, on the other hand, contain the parts of the genetic code that will be expressed as a protein.\nCheck-in questions \u2013 Set 1\n1  Name the part of a gene that is responsible for starting transcription.\n2  A sequence from the coding region of a gene is being converted to RNA.

It also needs an ending. The end of the process is marked by a part of the genetic sequence called the \u2018terminator\u2019.\nThe terminator is the sequence at the end of a gene that signals for transcription to stop. \nWithout the terminator, the process would continue along the DNA strand, creating a \u2018never-ending story\u2019. As you may appreciate from the discussion of protein synthesis and protein structure earlier in this chapter, this is critically important. Extending the sequence even just a little, or even changing a single base within an exon, can have catastrophic consequences for the protein that is made and the organism as a whole.Coding region \nthe introns and exons of a gene that are transcribed into pre-mRNA\nExon\nDNA\nmature mRNApre-mRNAExon Exon Exon ExonIntron Intron Intron Intron\nExon Exon Exon Exon ExonIntron Intron Intron Intron\nFigure 2D\u20132 Introns and exons form the coding region of a gene.

  "Page 83": "Operators: the genetic \u2018off-switch\u2019\nOur genetic story now has a beginning, a middle and \nan end. However, one final problem still needs to be addressed. The promoter, or \u2018on-switch\u2019 of the whole process, could theoretically restart transcription repeatedly. This would lead to huge numbers of mRNA copies being produced and lots of protein being synthesised. As you may remember from Units 1 and 2 Biology, organisms keep things tightly regulated, so that everything is kept at appropriate levels. The process of transcription is no different.\nOnce the correct levels of mRNA have been produced, transcription is stopped through the \nfunction of another sequence within genes, known as the \noperator . As you can see in Figure \n2D\u20131, the operator is found close to the promoter. The operator itself does not function independently; it works by interacting with another protein, known as the \nrepressor . If \nthe repressor is bound to the operator, RNA polymerase is blocked from binding to the promoter and transcription cannot commence. However, if the repressor is not bound to the operator, transcription can occur. The repressor is an example of a regulatory protein, which is coded for by a \nregulatory gene . These genes and the proteins they code \nfor are specifically involved in altering the expression of other genes. This is different from proteins that have a function throughout the body, such as those discussed in Section 2C, which are known as structural proteins (coded for by \nstructural genes ).\nIn the next section, the regulation of transcription is discussed, using the example of the trp operon.\nCheck-in questions \u2013 Set 2\n1  What is the role of the operator in a gene?\n2  What might happen to the cell if a gene had no operator or terminator?\n3  When is the first time that you would expect to see uracil during the process of going from a gene to a protein?\nRegulation: the trp operon\nTo help you understand how gene expression is regulated, this section examines a specific system to highlight these mechanisms. There are many well-defined examples, but we will focus on just one, the trp \noperon , which is required for this course.\nThe trp operon is involved in the production of tryptophan (trp), which is an amino acid and therefore important for the synthesis of proteins.

  "Page 84": "much tryptophan is available. As a general rule, resources are limited within organisms, \nand as such, organisms don\u2019t perform processes that are unnecessary. Considering this, you could imagine that, at times when tryptophan levels are high, the organism would not want to be producing more. On the other hand, as tryptophan is an important amino acid, when levels become low, it is critical that more can be produced. Let\u2019s look at both these scenarios and see how this regulation is maintained at the genetic level.\nScenario 1: tryptophan levels are low\nFor each of these situations, it is useful to start by thinking about what the aim of the organism is in the current circumstances and how it will achieve that in the context of the trp operon. For scenario 1, this will be as follows:\nAim: To raise the levels of tryptophan by producing more.\nSolution: Increase transcription of the genes necessary to produce tryptophan (that is, \nthose within the trp operon).\ntrpEtrp repressor (inactive)Low tryptophan:\nTranscription RNA polymerase\ntrpD trpC trpB trpA ODNA\nP\nFigure 2D\u20134 When tryptophan levels are low, RNA polymerase binds to the promoter and initiates \ntranscription of the trp operon genes. This leads to the synthesis of tryptophan.\nAs you can see in Figure 2D\u20134, this process involves RNA polymerase binding to the \npromoter and many copies of the trpE to trpA genes being transcribed, which will then be translated into the relevant proteins. These proteins will then help synthesise tryptophan.\nScenario 2: tryptophan levels are high\nOnce again, let\u2019s start by looking at the aim and solution in this scenario, and then discuss the mechanisms by which that solution is achieved.\nAim: To stop making tryptophan.\nSolution: Stop transcription of the genes necessary to produce tryptophan (that is, those \nwithin the trp operon).\nAs things stand from Scenario 1, the cell is currently producing mRNA copies of the genes contained within the trp operon, which will lead to the synthesis of the proteins required to make tryptophan. This is occurring because RNA polymerase can bind to the promoter of the trp operon and transcribe the genes contained within it.\nAs you learned earlier in this section, the role of the operator within a gene is to be the \u2018off-\nswitch\u2019 for transcription, which is exactly what is required in this scenario. So how does the operator work?\nThe purpose of the operator is to provide a binding site for the repressor. In this way, it works \nin a very similar way to the promoter, which provides a binding site for RNA polymerase. However, once the repressor has bound to the operator site, it prevents RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter. In this way, the transcription of the operon is prevented.PPS\n72\nCHAPTER 2 FROM DNA TO PROTEINS\n",
  "Page 85": "While this may seem straightforward, it is important to recognise that the repressor protein is \npresent at all times. Considering this, how does an organism prevent transcription from being stopped in scenario 1 and only stopped in scenario 2? The answer can be seen in Figure 2D\u20135. When tryptophan levels are high, tryptophan binds to the repressor, causing a change in shape that allows it to bind to the operator. This prevents RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter, which stops transcription and leads to a decrease in the synthesis of tryptophan.\ntrpEDNAHigh tryptophan:\nNo transcriptionTryptophan\ntrp repressor\n(active)RNA polymerase\ntrpD trpC trpB trpA P\n O\nFigure 2D\u20135 When tryptophan levels are high, the repressor binds to the operator to prevent \ntranscription of the trp operon genes.\n2D SKILLS\nKnowing your definitions\nAs you will have noticed, there are many terms in Units 3 & 4 Biology that you need to be able to define. Indeed, almost all questions in this year\u2019s assessments will require you to know a definition. You may be asked directly (for example, the question specifically asks you to define a term) or indirectly (for example, you aren\u2019t prompted for a definition in the question, but you are required to know it, to provide a complete and accurate answer). Considering the importance of this skill, here are some strategies to help enhance your ability to master this concept:1 \n Separate your definitions. You will likely end up with a lot of notes by the end of the year. Having your exact definitions mixed in with all your other content will make it harder to learn them and easier to overlook them. Create flashcards or use an online tool that allows you to have a specific place to store terms and their meanings, so you can easily refer to them and learn them when needed.\n2 \n Always clarify. There is no point making notes and accomplishing strategy 1, if the definitions that you are writing down are inaccurate. Doing so would reinforce wrong information whenever you study. If you have any definitions that you want to check or are unsure of, refer to this textbook or ask your teacher. It is always better to be sure than sorry! This also leads to strategy 3.\n3 \n Ask the experts. Past VCAA examiner\u2019s reports can be an effective way to find appropriate and accurate definitions of terms that you need to know. These reports often contain definitions that the assessors deem worthy of full marks. This is a great way of making sure the definitions you are using are the right ones.\nAn example of this can be found in the 2018 examiner\u2019s report, looking at Section B \nQuestion 6a. The question asks for the functional differen\nce between a structural gene \nand a regulatory gene. This requires you to know the definition of a structural gene as one that \u2018codes for a protein that becomes part of the structure or function of an organism\u2019, whereas a \u2018regulatory gene controls another gene\u2019.PPS\nVIDEO 2D\u20132 \nSKILLS: KNOWING YOUR DEFINITIONS\n73 2D GENE STRuCTuRE AND EXPRES SION\n",

Every \norganism has DNA inside its cells, and the specific sequence of nucleotides that makes up this DNA determines what proteins are made. Some species have structural similarities, and therefore the DNA of these species can be similar. Within a species, DNA is a macromolecule that is passed from generation to generation.\nSince the discovery of DNA and the determination of its structure, biologists have developed techniques \nto isolate specific sections of DNA, called genes, to investigate some of the following key ideas:\n \u2022 exploring the molecular basis of disease\n \u2022 developing products for medicinal purposes\n \u2022 solving crime and paternity disputes\n \u2022 understanding how plants and animals develop and function, and how they have evolved \nover time\n \u2022 managing and conserving endangered species.\nThis chapter explores some key techniques used in these modern science investigations.

Often, they carry out a number of DNA techniques to help solve a crime, within a 40-minute episode. In reality, even though the same methods are used, the process is much slower. Some of the DNA analysis tools explored in this section, such as restriction enzymes, gel electrophoresis and the polymerase chain reaction, take many hours to run. In addition to the time that these methods take, prior analysis and preparation of materials are required. The TV versions also do not account for the fact that some techniques need to be run one after the other, in order to obtain meaningful results.3A \nFigure 3A\u20131 Actor David Caruso as Horatio Caine in CSI: Miami , \nanalysing a crime scene\nEXPLAIN\nThe importance of DNA\nDNA is a macromolecule that is passed from pre-existing cells to new cells.

The bacterium\u2019s own DNA is protected from these restriction enzymes by chemical modification and enzymes that modify the bacterial DNA so it is not recognised by the restriction enzyme, or by simply not having the recognition site in the first place.\nFigure 3A\u20133 Bacteriophages (with nucleic acid in the capsid head) infecting a bacterial cell\nPPS\n83 3A COMMON  DNA TOOLS  AND TECHNIQ UES\n",
  "Page 96": "Differences between restriction enzymes\nThere are more than 3000 different restriction enzymes, with only around 600 of these \ncommercially available to scientists. Each restriction enzyme recognises a specific recognition site in the DNA. Restriction enzymes are therefore named based on the following international guidelines:\n \u2022 abbreviation, in letters, of the name of the bacterium in which they are naturally found\n \u2022 Roman numerals after the letters to classify the specific enzyme from the same \nbacterium (as usually there is more than one).\nAs an example, HaeIII is the third endonuclease isolated from the bacterium Haemophi\nlus \naegyptius.

These indicate the location in the \nsugar\u2013phosphate backbone where the specific restriction enzyme digests (cuts) the DNA. This location within the recognition site determines whether the fragments of DNA produced from this will result in \nsticky ends  or blunt ends  (shown in columns three and \nfour). Note also that each recognition site is usually 4\u20136 base pairs long and is a palindrome . \nThis means they read the same in a 5\u2032 (5 prime) to 3\u2032 (3 prime) direction on the template strand as they do on the coding strand, remembering that the two strands of DNA run in opposite directions, as you learned in Section 2A.\nFor example, in EcoRI (in Table 3A\u20131), the coding strand reads GAATTC and the template \nstrand reads GAATTC, if looking at both from the 5\u2032 end first.Table 3A\u20131 Different restriction enzymes with their respective recognition sites and resulting \nfragments following digestion\nAluI\nHaeIII\nBamHI\nHindIII\nEcoRIBluntBlunt\nStickyStickySticky5\u00b4 ...

  "Page 97": "DNA ligase\nIn genetic engineering, sometimes two fragments of DNA need to be joined. This is \nessentially the reverse effect of restriction enzymes, which digest DNA. To join fragments of DNA, an enzyme is required, as is the case for most processes that occur within the body. This enzyme is called \nDNA ligase . Its role is to catalyse the joining of pieces of double-\nstranded DNA at their sugar\u2013phosphate backbone. This joining of fragments of DNA can create a longer linear strand of DNA, or even a circular DNA molecule. It can also join fragments of DNA from different species. These techniques are explored in Section 3B.\nLINK3B APPLICATION \nAND IMPLICATIONS OF DNA MANIPULATION TECHNIQUESDNA ligase \nan enzyme that joins two pieces of DNA at their sugar\u2013phosphate backbone\nFigure 3A\u20134 DNA ligase acts as a \u2018glue\u2019 that joins two fragments of DNA together at the sugar\u2013\nphosphate backbone.G\nC T C C T A GG ATA G TDNA\nfragmentSticky\nends\nDNA\nligaseC C C TA\nG A G\nDNA\nfragment\nThe types of ends matter for DNA ligase\nAs you will recall, blunt end fragments of DNA are produced when the restriction enzyme \ncuts straight across the sugar\u2013phosphate backbone of both DNA strands. As they have no overhanging nucleotides, DNA ligase is able to join them with any other fragment of DNA that also has a blunt end, though with more difficulty than when there are overhangs. This is random and not overly specific.\nSticky end fragments are produced when the restriction enzyme cuts between the same \npair of nucleotides in the palindromic recognition site on each strand of DNA. This results in overhanging nucleotides that DNA ligase can only join to another fragment of DNA containing complementary overhanging nucleotides. If not, the overhanging nucleotides would not form complementary base pairs due to hydrogen bonding between the nitrogenous bases A and T, and C and G, as you learned in Section 2A. Therefore, this fragment must also have been cut with the same restriction enzyme (shown in Figure 3A\u20134), making sticky ends of DNA more specific than blunt ends.\n2A NUCLEIC \nACIDSLINKWORKSHEET 3A\u20131 RESTRICTION ENZYMES\nDOC\n85 3A COMMON  DNA TOOLS  AND TECHNI QUES\n",

Therefore, a simple method is needed to amplify the DNA to produce large quantities in a short amount of time. This method is called the \npolymerase chain reaction \n(PCR) . As you will see later in this section, PCR is particularly useful for forensic scientists to \namplify certain regions of the DNA from traces of blood found at a crime scene.\nThe polymerase chain reaction uses a mixture of ingredients that are heated and cooled \nin cycles. After each cycle, the number of copies of the DNA is doubled. At the beginning of the process, the ingredients are added to a microtube, which is then placed in a thermocycler (a machine that acts as a heating block to rapidly change the temperature for each stage). The stages of the cycle are outlined in Table 3A\u20132.PPS\nVIDEO 3A\u20132 \nSTAGES OF PCR\nDOCWORKSHEET \n3A\u20132 \nPOLYMERASE \nCHAIN \nREACTION\n86\nCHAPTER 3 DNA MANIPULATION TECHNIQUES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS\n",

This means that when a sample of DNA is mixed with restriction enzyme(s), fragments of differing lengths are produced. Often, biologists are only interested in one section of this DNA and so they need to isolate the relevant fragment. This is made even more difficult because DNA is too small to see and is colourless. This is where \ngel electrophoresis  proves valuable.\nThe basic process of gel electrophoresis is as follows: 1\n Digested samples containing the DNA fragments and a dye are loaded into wells at one end of an agarose gel.\n2\n The gel is covered in a solution containing ions, which allows the movement of DNA fragments when an electric field is applied to the gel through a negative electrode at the well end and a positive electrode at the other end. DNA is negatively charged due to the phosphate groups.\n3\n The negatively charged DNA migrates from the wells at the negative electrode of the gel towards the positive electrode. DNA from each well stays in the \u2018lane\u2019 running from each well. The DNA fragments separate according to their size and the charge they carry. \nSmaller DNA fragments travel faster (and therefore further) than larger fragments.\n4\n The dye in the samples travels faster than the DNA and, when the \u2018dye front\u2019 (its position) reaches the positive electrode, the power is turned off and the gel plate is removed for analysis.\n5\n At the end, when the agarose gel has been removed, a different dye that attaches to DNA can be added and this reveals where the DNA fragments are.Gel \nelectrophoresis a technique used to separate different-sized fragments of DNA (or protein)\n(\u2013) Negative\nelectrodeLane 1 Lane 2 Lane 3\nDirection of\nmovement of\nDNA in gelWells with\nDNA sample andloading dye\n(+) Positive\nelectrodeGel(covered ina buffer solution)\nDifferent-sizedDNA fragmentsseparated andrevealed by staining\nDye front\nFigure 3A\u20136 Left: In a laboratory, an agarose gel is placed in a container, covered in solution and connected to a \npower source.

  "Page 101": "The reason for adding \u2018loading\u2019 dye to the sample at the beginning is that DNA is colourless \nand during the \u2018run\u2019 the operator can\u2019t see how far it has moved. This allows a scientist to determine the time at which to stop the gel electrophoresis process, and therefore the time at which the DNA fragments have had the longest to separate. The \u2018invisibility\u2019 of the DNA is also the reason for using a different dye to reveal it on the agarose gel. Dyes that fluoresce under ultraviolet light can also be attached to the DNA. The glowing patches can then be digitally photographed for analysis.\nThe importance of a control\nIn gel electrophoresis, conditions can vary each time a gel is run.

This means scientists cannot use something as simple as a ruler to measure the distance travelled by a fragment of DNA to determine its size.\nOne lane in the gel must always \nbe used to run a control. In gel electrophoresis, this is called a \nDNA \nstandard , or DNA ladder. A DNA \nstandard is a DNA sample that has been digested with a particular restriction enzyme that produces many different-sized fragments of DNA with known lengths. These DNA standards are usually purchased and come with a pictorial representation of the fragments expected to be seen on a gel and their respective sizes, usually in base pairs (bp) or kilo base pairs (kbp). This allows the scientist to compare the sizes of the fragments in their DNA\u00a0sample to the fragments with known size from the DNA standard (Figure 3A\u20137).DNA standard \na DNA sample that contains fragments of DNA of known size that is used to compare the sizes of unknown DNA fragments in base pairs or kilo base pairs; also known as a DNA ladder\nFigure 3A\u20137 Using a DNA ladder.

A problem with this technique was that some people developed antibodies against animal insulin, which made it ineffective. Insulin is now produced by recombinant DNA techniques, in which the human insulin-producing gene is inserted into bacteria.\nHowever, bacteria can transfer plasmids (circular rings of DNA) between each other and \nalso to different species of bacteria. For this reason there has been some trepidation on the part of scientists in using bacteria to make copies of human genes. Their concerns centre on the fact that, even though these bacteria are modified in strict isolation and under tightly controlled conditions, the process may inadvertently create a strain of genetically modified bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics.\nAs you will see in this section, in the process of gene cloning, the use of antibiotic- \nresistance genes in plasmids to identify bacteria with the inserted human genes is gradually being replaced by the use of enzymes that make fluorescent substances. The most common example, which you can do in the school laboratory, is using an enzyme from jellyfish that produces a green fluorescent protein (GFP). As the name suggests, these jellyfish fluoresce green when exposed to UV light. In the same way that the gene of interest would be inserted into the plasmid, the gene for GFP is inserted, thereby avoiding the need to use antibiotic resistance genes.\nLINK8A EMERGENCE, \nRE-EMERGENCE AND DISEASE CONTAINMENTFigure 3B\u20131 Insulin was originally taken from the pancreas of pigs and cows .  \n   \nPig pancreas Insulin extracted Insulin purified, pasteurised and bottledLINK7D THIRD LINE OF DEFENCE\n93 3B APPLICAT ION AND IMPLICA TIONS  OF DNA MANIPUL ATION  TECHNIQ UES\n",
  "Page 106": "EXPLAIN\nThe application of DNA manipulation techniques\nDNA profiling\nThe main use of the process of gel electrophoresis, which you studied in Section 3A, in \nforensic science is in DNA profiling , or DNA fingerprinting.\nIn DNA profiling, analysts need to find unique patterns that will identify an individual. Regions of DNA that code for certain proteins or enzymes are not useful for DNA profiling, because they code for products or functions that are the same in everyone. So analysts instead study stretches of non-coding regions of DNA. These are called \u2018short tandem repeats\u2019 (STRs) if they are 2\u20136 base pairs long, or \nvariable number tandem repeats (VNTRs)  \nif they are longer, typically 20\u201360 base pairs. The number of repeats can vary between individuals. If only one region was focused on, the number of repeats of the sequence could be the same in two individuals. Therefore, in humans, 13 of these VNTR regions are studied in DNA profiling, so the chance of two individuals having exactly the same number of nucleotide repeats at each location would be very low. In fact, only identical twins have the same VNTRs at each region. Each individual has some VNTRs (and STRs) that come from their parents. The VNTRs can be inherited from either the mother or the father and can be a combination of both. An individual\u2019s VNTRs will never have sequences that are not present in their parents. Each individual has two copies of each VNTR, because they are \nalleles , one from each pair of homologous chromosomes  (chromosomes of the same size, \ncentromere and banding pattern from the mother and father).LINK3A COMMON \nDNA TOOLS AND \nTECHNIQUES\nDNA profiling \na method of DNA analysis in which regions of DNA from different individuals are analysed and compared\nVariable number \ntandem repeats (VNTRs) a region of a chromosome that shows variation between individuals in length and number of repeats of nucleotide sequences; also referred to as short tandem repeats (STRs) when 2\u20136 base pairs long\nAllele \nan alternative form of a gene\nHomologous \nchromosomes chromosomes that have matching structural features (size, banding pattern, centromere location) and gene loci\nFigure 3B\u20132 A pair of homologous chromosomes, each with a different number of repeats for the \nnucleotide sequence GATTC.

The steps in this process are as follows:1\n DNA is extracted from the cells obtained from an individual (e.g. blood, semen or hair from a crime scene).\n2\n The DNA of the 13 different VNTR regions (or a set number of these) is amplified by PCR.\n3\n The DNA is cut with specific restriction enzymes (or multiple restriction enzymes) that have recognition sites at either side of the VNTR regions.\n4\n The DNA fragments are loaded into wells on agarose gel and separated by gel electrophoresis.\nSmaller alleles, or nucleotide sequences of DNA, have fewer repeats of the short sequence and will therefore migrate faster and further through the agarose gel than larger alleles with \nmore repeats.

Genetic screening can be \nconducted on adults when they suspect they may be carrying an allele for a disorder they could pass onto their offspring. It can also be conducted on a foetus to test for the presence of a disorder (prenatal testing) or on a newborn baby (postnatal testing). It is used to identify cases where a baby may develop disorders such as those listed in Table 3B\u20131.\nMany other common medical conditions can be detected as part of postnatal testing, \nincluding phenylketonuria (PKU) and hypothyroidism.

  "Page 109": "Implications of DNA profiling and genetic screening\nEthical\nEssentially, ethics deal with questions of right or wrong, or \u2018Should I or shouldn\u2019t I?\u2019 In the case \nof DNA profiling and genetic screening, some examples of questions to be dealt with are:\n \u2022 Informed consent for DNA sampling \u2013 this is an issue \nfor children under the age of 18 years, who at the time of having a DNA sample collected rely on parents to provide consent on their behalf.\n \u2022 Secure storage of DNA information \u2013 who has access to \nthis information and what would happen if it fell into the wrong hands?

Different governments have their own regulations concerning this.\nAn example of the third point is a couple finding out that they might both be carriers of the allele for Huntington disease. This is a late-onset condition that might not become apparent until after they have a child. Would they want to know before having a child, if their offspring could develop the condition? Would this change their own quality of life? Remember, they might \nnot develop the disease.\nSocial\nSocial implications refer to the impact of the technology on more than one or two individuals. For DNA profiling and genetic screening, some examples of questions to be addressed are:\n \u2022 The possibility of incorrect identification of a suspect from a sample of DNA obtained \nfrom a crime scene \u2013 this could be caused by contamination of DNA. This would not only affect the individual who has been wrongfully accused, as well as their partner and/or immediate family, but would also have implications for the judicial system as a whole (fairness/justice). So the question is: Is it right to convict a person based solely on DNA evidence?\n \u2022 Privacy of the information obtained from a DNA profile or genetic screen \u2013 for example, \nwhat would the implications be for society if a DNA profile was held of every person, even those not convicted of a crime? In Victoria, a DNA sample cannot be obtained from a person unless they give permission. This gives the person the opportunity to know beforehand the risks associated with storage of the information and, if digital results are hacked or compromised, who might access th\neir personal DNA information.\n \u2022 Information about the possibility of inheriting a genetic disease \u2013 intending parents \nmight be faced with difficult reproductive decisions. This could be heightened depending on whether they are planning to have a child or are already pregnant. They could be faced with the ethical implications of choosing to terminate a pregnancy. This could place strain on their relationship, and they might seek professional counselling.\n \u2022 People who have a genetic predisposition to certain conditions may find they are \ndiscriminated against by employers, insurers or other bodies.Figure 3B\u20134 Parents being counselled on results \nof genetic testing and their likelihood of having a child with a genetic disorder\nWORKSHEET \n3B\u20131 DNA PROFILING AND GENETIC SCREENING, AND IMPLICATIONS\nDOC\n97 3B APPLICA TION  AND IMPLIC ATIONS  OF DNA MANIPU LATION  TECHNI QUES\n",

If the couple chose not to have a child, this would avoid the expense not only for themselves, but for society, of providing the \nmedical and educational support that would be required for an affected child.\nBiological\nBiological implications can affect not only the organism in question, but more than one organism or species. For DNA profiling and genetic screening, an example of questions raised is:\n \u2022 Altering the affected genome \u2013 for some inherited disorders, it may be possible to \ncorrect the mutation that causes the condition, using gene editing. (This also raises ethical issues.) The biological implications could be very significant for humans.

The building blocks (monomers) you learned about in Section 2A are identical in structure. The nitrogenous bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine, and their complementarity) that make up part of these monomers are identical. In essence this means that the DNA of one species can be combined with the DNA of a different species, using a range of DNA manipulation techniques, which were explored in Section 3A.\n Nowadays, genetic engineers can create genes, and even complete genomes for some species, by using artificial nucleotides in a laboratory setting. They can work backwards from the desired final protein sequence, by looking at the specific chain of amino acids, identifying mRNA codons that code for these and then using stored computer software to synthesise the DNA nucleotides. This built sequence of DNA can then be inserted directly into a plasmid (circular piece of DNA in prokaryotes), all without the need for a physical DNA template.LINK9B EVOLVING \nAND NON-\nEVOLVING \nPOPULATIONS\nLINK2A NUCLEIC \nACIDS\n3A COMMON \nDNA TOOLS AND \nTECHNIQUESLINK\nPhosphate\nSugarNitrogenous\nbase\nFigure 3B\u20135 The monomer of DNA\n98\nCHAPTER 3 DNA MANIPULATION TECHNIQUES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS\n",
  "Page 111": "The basis of genetic engineering is \nthe ability to remove a single gene or, in some circumstances, a group of genes, from one organism and transfer them into another organism. In the new organism, the gene is then able to direct protein synthesis (transcription and translation), producing a fully functioning protein.\nThe importance of a vector\nTransferring DNA from one cell to another is not simple. A \nvector  is \nrequired. The vector acts as a \u2018vehicle\u2019 that carries the DNA between the donor and recipient cells. The most common vector is a plasmid. When DNA from the donor cell/organism is placed into the plasmid, this can then be used to transfer the DNA into the recipient bacterial cell. When DNA from the host organism is combined with DNA from the donor organism, it is said to be \nrecombinant DNA  (in this case, a recombinant plasmid; Figure 3B\u20137). \nThe organism that has this recombinant DNA is referred to as genetically modified (more on this in Section 3C).\nPlasmids for the purpose of gene cloning \ncan be obtained directly from bacteria by using enzymes to break down the cell walls and then centrifuging (spinning the bacteria at high speeds) to isolate the smaller plasmid from the larger, single bacterial DNA chromosome. Or plasmids that have already been harvested and modified can be purchased. These are ready to be used in processes in the laboratory, such as protein purification or genome engineering (for example, for CRISPR, which is explored in more detail in Section 3D). The advantage of using plasmids is that they carry many different recognition sites for restriction enzymes.\nThe gene cloning process\nThe gene cloning  process combines the use of a plasmid with some of the DNA manipulation \ntechniques outlined in Section 3A. The key steps of this process in relation to inserting the human insulin gene into bacteria for insulin protein production, which is vital in the treatment of type I diabetes (T1D), are outlined in Figure 3B\u20138. If you studied Unit 1 Biology, you will already know that this disorder results from the cells that produce insulin, beta cells in the pancreas, being targeted for destruction by the immune system. This is known as an \nautoimmune disease . You will learn more about these types of diseases in \nSection 7D.\nInsulin is a vital protein-based hormone, responsible for controlling blood glucose levels by \nreducing the concentration of blood glucose when it becomes too high. The process of gene cloning (outlined in Figure 3B\u20138) is a way of mass-producing insulin for people with T1D.Figure 3B\u20136 Bacterial cell, showing the difference \nbetween the larger circular bacterial chromosome and the smaller circular plasmid.\nChromosomal DNAPilus\nPlasmid\nFlagellumCell\nmembraneCell wallCapsuleCytoplas mRibosomes\nLINK3C GENETICALLY \nMODIFIED AND TRANSGENIC ORGANISMSVector \na DNA molecule used as a vehicle to carry foreign genetic material from one organism to another\nRecombinant \nDNA DNA that has been artificially formed by combining DNA from different organisms\nFigure 3B\u20137 The combination of a foreign DNA fragment with a \nvector (in this case a plasmid), producing recombinant DNAVector Recombinant DNA DNA fragment\nLINK3D THE FUTURE \nOF GENOME EDITING\nAutoimmune \ndisease a disease in which the immune system acts abnormally and begins to attack the body\u2019s own cells (self cells)\nLINK3A COMMON \nDNA TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\nLINK7D THIRD LINE OF DEFENCEGene cloning \nthe production of exact copies (clones) of a gene (DNA sequence) using various DNA manipulation techniques\n99 3B APPLICA TION  AND IMPLIC ATIONS  OF DNA MANIPU LATION  TECHNI QUES\n",

Untransformed bacteria, which have no plasmid, and therefore no antibiotic resistance gene, do not survive in this environment.\nHowever, there are ethical concerns about using this technique. As the bacteria are able \nto transfer plasmids between each other, and even to other species of bacteria (bacterial conjugation), it is possible that this may result in antibiotic-resistant bacteria, possibly creating a \u2018superbug\u2019.Bacterial chromosome\nCloning\nClonesBacterial cell\nUntransformed\nbacteriaTransformed\nbacteria\nNutrient\nagar plat eBacteria plated on medium\nwith antibioticOnly bacteria containing\nrecombinant DNA grow\nOnly transformed bacteria growPuri\ufb01cation\nTransformed bacteria \nbacteria that have taken up foreign DNA; in gene cloning, the foreign DNA is in the recombinant plasmid\nAntibiotic \na substance that inhibits the growth of bacteria; an example is penicillinStep 4: Genetic transformation\nRecombinant plasmids (and  \nnon-recombinant plasmids)  are mixed with bacteria. They  are then soaked in a solution  containing calcium ions (e.g.  calcium chloride) and heat  shocked. This opens up the pores in the cell membrane of the bacteria,  \nincreasing the chances of them taking up the recombinant plasmid.\nNote: Less than 1% of the bacteria actually take up the recombinant plasmid. Most of the \ntime the bacteria do not take up the plasmid at all, or take up the non-recombinant plasmid (mentioned in the note in step 3). This process is very sensitive and if the heat shock is not done for exactly the right time and at the correct temperature, then no transformation occurs.\nGenetic \ntransformation the genetic alteration of a cell, resulting from taking up foreign DNA\nStep 7: Extraction and purification of \nthe insulin protein\nThe insulin protein from the \ntransformed bacteria that survived on the nutrient agar plate with antibiotic is extracted and purified, ready to provide to diabetic patients.\n101 3B APPLICA TION  AND IMPLIC ATIONS  OF DNA MANIPU LATION  TECHNI QUES\n",

However, some people view the transfer of genes from one species to another as unethical, regardless of the overall benefit it could provide to society.\nSocial\nThere are many advantages of gene cloning for society, including:\n \u2022 reduced cost of therapeutics made with bacteria, providing greater access to treatments \nfor more individuals in the community\n \u2022 the creation of employment opportunities in the biotechnology industry, as well as \nmarketing and sales of these products.\nA potential disadvantage of gene cloning is its misuse for non-therapeutic purposes, such as creating performance-enhancing drugs, giving athletes an unfair advantage in competitions.\nEconomic\nAn economic advantage of using bacteria for gene cloning is that it has made the production of therapeutics, like insulin for diabetics, relatively cheap \u2013 large quantities can be produced, with a reliable (constant) supply. However, it is still important to note that this benefit depends on the country and the socioeconomic background of the individual.\nBiological\nInserting human genes into plasmids, creating a recombinant plasmid, and performing genetic transformation to make copies of proteins to give to patients, provides a purer or more effective product than using proteins purified from animals. This has made new and safer treatments for disorders and the development of vaccines possible. It also reduces the chances of side effects or of transmitting diseases. The use of vaccines reduces the number of deaths from diseases, and this contributes to an increase in the average life expectancy of the population. This results in the birth rate increasing more than the death rate, and the increase in the world\u2019s population increases the strain on the environment and affects other species that share our ecosystems. In the long term, this changes the course of natural selection and our evolution.\nThe risk of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (superbugs) developing has already been outlined. \nSuch a development would be very difficult to overcome.

  "Page 115": "3B SKILLS\nGene cloning over PCR?\nThrough all the steps of gene cloning, you might have asked, \u2018Why doesn\u2019t the scientist just isolate the insulin gene of interest and then use PCR to amplify this section of DNA?\u2019 The answer is threefold.1\n While PCR makes copies of DNA, genetic engineers need to know that this insulin gene can be converted into a fully functioning protein. For this to occur, there must be a set-up in which protein synthesis can take place, and this requires the different types of RNA and ribosomes that you learned about in Section 2C.\n2\n Bacteria reproduce by binary fission every 20 minutes \u2013 this means that every 20 minutes, the number of bacteria doubles. Even within this time, plasmids replicate independently of the bacteria. Therefore, even more plasmids, and therefore copies of the insulin gene, can be produced in every reproductive cell cycle.\n3\n PCR requires a number of expensive ingredients: samples of the four nucleotides, a heat-resistant enzyme, and forward and reverse primers. In comparison, the use of restriction enzymes and bacteria, like E. coli, is inexpensive.\nD\netermining whether transformed bacteria have taken up the recombinant or \nnon-recombinant plasmidThe advantage of plasmids is that they usually contain, or can be constructed to contain, genes that code for antibiotic resistance. This gives bacteria with that plasmid a survival advantage in the presence of the antibiotic that they have resistance to.Common examination questions in this topic involve how the transformed bacteria are identified. To determine which bacteria are transformed, the bacteria are grown on agar nutrient plates containing an antibiotic (e.g. ampicillin). The recombinant plasmid that has been taken up by transformed bacteria has a gene for resistance. It is important to recall here that it is also possible for transformed bacteria that contain a non-recombinant plasmid (without the gene of interest) to survive, as they still contain the antibiotic- resistance gene. This is shown in Figure 3B\u20139.LINK 2C PROTEINS\nFigure 3B\u20139 The three possibilities for bacteria after the genetic transformation \nstep in gene cloningAntibiotic-\nresistance\ngeneForeign DNA\n(DNA of interest)\nNon-recombinant plasmid Recombinant plasmid\nUntransformed bacterium\n(no plasmid)Transformed bacteriaVIDEO 3B\u20132 \nSKILLS: GENE CLONING  OVER PCR\nVIDEO 3B\u20133 SKILLS: DETERMINING WHETHER TRANSFORMED BACTERIA HAVE TAKEN UP THE RECOMBINANT PLASMID OR NON-RECOMBINANT PLASMID\n103 3B APPLICA TION  AND IMPLIC ATIONS  OF DNA MANIPU LATION  TECHNI QUES\n",

The recipient bacteria then demonstrated antibiotic resistance.\nYou might think this is where the story begins, but humans have actually been \u2018modifying\u2019 \norganisms for thousands of years. As far back as 30\n 000 BC, humans were changing the \nDNA of a particular species through the process of selective breeding, also referred to as artificial selection, which you will learn more about in Chapter 9. What was this species? It is one you are familiar with, if you look around when you go for a walk, watch TV or visit a pet store: dogs! Our ancestors domesticated wild wolves in Eastern Asia and selectively bred individuals to produce offspring that were initially more passive and compliant. \nFrom there, and over thousands of\n \nyears, everything from hair length, body shape and size, to colour, has been selected for, resulting in the many breeds that exist today. The difference between selective breeding and the current method of genetic modification is that the process is now much faster and does not require many generations to pass before change is noticeable.\nWith the rise of genetically modified \norganisms (GMOs) and the accompanying interest in them, various stakeholders have expressed their concerns about the implications, for our own health and, more broadly, that of the world\u2019s ecosystems. As a result, regulation of experiments and appropriate safety measures have been established for researchers, who also educate others in the broader scientific community about the significance of their findings.\nFigure 3C\u20131 Key developments and advances in the \nevolution of genetic engineering (GE) and genetically modified organisms30 000 BC\n1973\n1975\n1982\n1995\n2000\n20091996199219801974Arti/f_icial selection\nof wolves began\nScientists boyer and\nCohen developGE\nAsilomar Conference setsguidelines for futureGE experiments\nFDA approves Humulin,the /f_irst pharmaceuticalmanufacturedusing GE technology\nGolden Rice engineered tomitigate vitamin A de/f_iciency The pharmaceutical ATrynbecomes the /f_irst biologicalprotein produced by a GEanimal to be approved bythe US FDAHeribicide-resistant crops /f_irst introducedGE food consumed\nGE pharmaceuticals manufactured\nGenetic engineering technology used\nArti/f_icial selection / selective breeding usedFLAVR SAVR tomatoes become\n/f_irst GE food crop approved byUS Department of AgricultureUS Supreme Courtallows patentingof GE organismsScientists Jaenisch and Mintz create/f_irst GE animalOldest evidence of arti/f_icially selected\ncrops7800 BC\nGE ExperimentMoratorium\nUS EPA approvesthe /f_irstinsecticide-producingcrop\nPPS\n110\nCHAPTER 3 DNA MANIPULATION TECHNIQUES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS\n",

The process generates by-products that are damaging to the cellular components that convert light into chemical energy, and increasing global temperatures are causing this to occur more regularly.\nNormally when chlorophyll in the grana of chloroplasts absorbs light, water is split, \ncreating oxygen, hydrogen ions and electrons. The electrons help to power photosynthesis. However, heat can damage a key protein, D1, involved in this process. As such, scientists have genetically modified plants, such as the mustard plant, tobacco and rice, to better repair the damage caused by heat.\nAs you learned in Section 2B, DNA codes for proteins. In plant cells, DNA is located in \nthe nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Chloroplast DNA codes for proteins that are used by the chloroplast, like the D1 protein that is affected by heat. The issue with the chloroplast DNA is that it is much harder to modify than nuclear DNA. Scientists have removed the gene coding for this protein using restriction enzymes, combined it with a section of DNA that is activated during \u2018heat stress\u2019 and moved it into the nucleus.\nThe result observed \nin the mustard plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, was that it survived extreme heat (41\u00b0C) in the laboratory for 8 hours. Other studies with the mustard plant saw an 80% increase in plant biomass.\nSimilar results \nwere observed in transgenically modified rice crops in Shanghai in 2017, when the city reached temperatures above 36\u00b0C for 18 consecutive days. The transgenic crops yielded 8\u201310% more grain than normal plants. Even at normal temperatures, the yield of the transgenic rice crops was 20% higher.

This began in 2000, when scientists genetically engineered rice, producing what they called Golden Rice as a way to combat vitamin A deficiency, which kills over half a million people each year.\nThis strain of rice was transgenically modified when \ntwo genes, one from a daffodil and one from the bacterium Pantoea ananatis, were inserted. The genes result in the production of beta-carotene, which gives the rice its distinctive yellow colour (hence the name Golden Rice). Beta-carotene is also found in carrots, and when consumed by humans it is converted into vitamin A. As rice is a relatively cheap staple food, especially in developing countries, this transgenically modified (TMO) rice helps to reduce the number of people suffering from vitamin A deficiency. The added advantage of Golden Rice is that research has proved that these crops are unlikely to cross-pollinate unmodified crops, as rice crops usually self-pollinate. And, unlike many other modified crops, the seeds can be re-planted season after season, making it relatively cheap for farmers.\nFigure 3C\u20135 Comparison of GMO Golden Rice with \n\u2018normal\u2019 or standard rice\nNight blindness,\ncorneal ulcers\nDry mucous membranes,\ngingivitis,\nsmell disorders\nDelayed growth\nDry skin,\nacneDecreased procreation\nOtherFatigue,\nconcentration problemsHair loss\nAnaemia, \ndifficulty breathing,\nperformance degradation\nFigure 3C\u20136 The symptoms of vitamin A deficiency, which Golden Rice can help to reduce\n113 3C GENETICA LLy MODIFIE D AND TRANSGE NIC ORGANISMS\n",

This is a vital reason to continue using genetic engineering to increase crop yields.\nImproving disease resistance\nEffect of fungus on wheat production\nA disease known as wheat scab, caused by the fungus Fusarium graminearum,  has a huge \nimpact on the production of wheat and barley. The disease causes the grain to shrivel and \nreduces the yield of these plants. The fungus also releases a toxin that remains in grain destined for food consumption. If this toxin is in high concentrations, it can harm humans and animals. Therefore, in many countries, these infected grains must be discarded.\nAs you will learn in Section 6B, fungal infections can be treated by spraying the plants \nwith chemicals, known as fungicides. However, the pathogen infects plants during winter, meaning that rain can wash the fungicide away.\nScientists discovered a gene, called Fhb7, in a wild species related to wheat. This gene codes \nfor an enzyme, glutathione S-transferase, which is able to destroy trichothecenes (toxins released by the fungus). This allows the continual reproduction of wheat that has Fusarium  \nresistance. The Fhb7 gene was thought to have originated from a fungus that normally lives inside wild wheatgrass but does not cause disease, as the plant and the fungus exist together in a mutual symbiotic relationship. At some point, the fungal DNA managed to combine with the wheatgrass DNA, and is now incorporated into the wheatgrass genome. As you learned in Section 3B, it is normally bacteria that are associated with the transfer of genes between species of animals and plants \u2013 this was one of few examples of a fungus taking this role.\nExperiments highlighted the fact that adding the Fhb7 gene to wheat did not have any \nnegative effects on the grain\u2019s yield and provided the wheat with some resistance to \nfungal toxins.Figure 3C\u20137 The effect of the fungus Fusarium graminearum, \nwhich causes wheat scab.

  "Page 127": "Implications of genetically modifying plants\nBelow are outlined the types of implications, and examples of each, that need to be \nconsidered when genetically modifying plants for increased crop productivity and/or improved resistance to disease.\nEthical implications\nSome of the major ethical implications raised by the use of GMOs and TMOs are listed below. Note that most of these are negative implications.\n \u2022 Many individuals or groups consider the manipulation of any \norganism\u2019s genetic information to be unnatural.\n \u2022 Is the consumption of genetically modified (GM) plants safe \nfor humans? Has there been enough research to prove whether \nthere are short- or long-term impacts on an individual\u2019s health?\n \u2022 If cross-pollination occurs between GM crops and non-GM \ncrops growing nearby, then the farmers of the non-GM crops cannot claim that their crops are GM free. Also, the patents for those GM crops could be owned by companies.\n \u2022 Large biotechnology companies generally control the \nproduction and distribution of GM seeds. Some GM seeds become unviable (that is, they will not germinate) after just  one generation, which means farmers have to continually  \nre-purchase seeds, which can be expensive. Therefore, although the rewards of increased crop yield and reduced disease are potentially great, much of the farmer\u2019s profit is spent on buying new seeds year after year. This can be even more expensive if large conglomerate companies decide \nto increase their own profit by \nraising the price of seeds. This specifically has a link to social implications.\nSocial/economic implications\nRemember from Section 3B that social implications are those that have an impact on not only one or two individuals but a greater proportion of society. Some of the major social implications (both positive and negative) of the use of GMOs and TMOs are listed below. Note that many of these social implications can be linked closely to economic implications.\n \u2022Large companies that own the patents for GM seeds control the market and the cost of the seeds, and not all farmers can afford this technology. This increases the inequality between wealthier and poorer struggling farmers. Those who are able to afford the GM seeds initially can grow more crops, sell more and earn\n \nmore profit to buy seeds again in future seasons.\n \u2022 The reduced need to use pesticides due to GM \ncrops\u2019 improved resistance to disease could put manufacturers of these products out of business because of reduced sales.Figure 3C\u20138 A farmer in the United States \nfills his planter with GM corn seed.\nFigure 3C\u20139 Protesters tear up GM canola plants in 2002 at a demonstration against GM crops at a farm in England.

As was seen with Golden Rice, GM food \nwith improved nutritional value may lead to a reduction in deficiencies (like vitamin A \ndeficiency), resulting in healthier populations.\n \u2022 Plants that have been genetically modified to grow in harsher conditions due to climate \nchange could also help to reduce malnutrition in some countries.\n \u2022 Giving consumers a choice as to whether they buy GM foods is becoming increasingly \nimportant. (For example, the organic food industry has become very big in Western \ncountries.) This makes correct labelling of products as \u2018GM\u2019 or \u2018GM free\u2019 crucial, and has been legislated in Australia.\nBiological implications\nAny unnatural (or natural) change to an organism\u2019s genetic material that changes the way it behaves has the potential to affect other living organisms in the same ecosystem. These effects can be positive or negative. Some of the biological implications of GMO and TMO plants are listed below.\n \u2022 As GM crops can result in increased growth and yield of plants, less space is required for \ngrowth. This means less land is cleared for farming, which reduces the loss of habitat for other organisms.\n \u2022 A reduction in the use of insecticides or pesticides means less of these chemicals flowing \ninto rivers and streams, and therefore less impact on aquatic life or other organisms that drink this water (including humans, in some countries).\n \u2022 Increased planting of GM crops could lead to loss of biodiversity, as the genomes \nof GM crops are identical (or very similar). If selection pressures such as disease or environmental changes occur, the lack of variation in the plant species could mean a drastically reduced survival rate for the crop, resulting in shortages in the food supply for a community or population.\n \u2022 The genes from GM crops could be inadvertently transferred to another plant of the \nsame (or very similar) species that is not GM, via cross-pollination caused by insects or wind. This links back to the ethical implications mentioned previously.\nNOTE\nIt is important to be aware that much of the work in genetic modification has been conducted on, \nand is established with, animals. This includes the benefits of the production of increased supply of food (e.g. milk) and resources (e.g. wool). This is not covered in this text, as the curriculum only requires you to focus on genetically modified organisms relating to increased agricultural yield and improved resistance to disease (plants).\n3C SKILLS\nIdentifying important information in questions\nAssessment questions about genetically modified and transgenically modified organisms will not require you to know a specific example.

Some people argue that GM crops are the only way to feed the growing world population and to minimise environmental harm. Other people express different views.\nBt cotton is a type of cotton that contains two genes from a soil bacterium, Bacillus \nthuringiensis,  enabling it to produce insect-resistant proteins. Australian farmers of  \nBt cotton use only 15% of the quantity of the insecticide that was once needed to protect their cotton crops. However, Bt cotton is not as resistant to the main insect pest of cotton crops, Helicoverpa, as it has been in the past.\nIn Australia, Bt cotton is picked by machine, but in India, it is picked by hand. \nWorkers in India have developed skin allergies, which have been attributed to Bt cotton proteins.\nTraditionally, farmers have saved money by keeping seed from one year\u2019s crop \nto plant the following year. However, it is illegal for farmers to keep Bt cotton seeds  because these seeds have been declared the legal property of the company \nMonsanto. Every year, cotton farmers must buy more seeds from Monsanto.\nUnlike Monsanto, the company that produces the GM food crop Golden Rice \nallows farmers to replant the rice they harvested the previous year. By inserting a gene from the bacterium Erwinia uredovora and another from a daffodil, Narcissus pseudonarcissus, into white rice, scientists produced Golden Rice \u2013 a rice variety containing higher levels of vitamin A. People who eat Golden Rice avoid vitamin A deficiency. Trials conducted in several countries have shown that Golden Rice is safe to eat .\n117 3C GENETIC ALLy MODIFI ED AND TRANSG ENIC  ORGANISMS\n",

This is because it carries a plasmid containing genes that cause the growth of a tumour. However, a recombinant plasmid can be inserted into the bacterium that carries a desired gene, but lacks the tumour growth gene. The plant cells are then mixed with the bacteria and the transformed bacteria infect the plant cells. These plant cells are then allowed to grow in a nutrient agar and healthy plants are produced from the plant mass.

These changes could allow the Australian fishery industry to avoid time-consuming and costly GM regulations as set by the country\u2019s jurisdictions, because the slight DNA changes involved result in variations that could occur naturally within a population. As you will see in Section 9B, this variation in a species could make it more adaptable to changes in selection pressures, such as disease or drought. This would allow the industry to plan productively for a world experiencing rapid climate change and growing population.\nOne of the newest forms of gene editing technology is CRISPR-Cas9, which targets \na specific location on a gene and inserts, deletes or replaces DNA at this location. One possible application of this method is to make fish, like salmon, sterile so that they do not spend energy reproducing and instead use their energy for rapid growth. This technology could also be broadened to include environmental productivity, by engineering plants to provide fish with a suitable array of nutrients, enabling further growth. This technology could allow food industries such as fisheries to keep up with growing population demand.\nFigure 3D\u20131 A fish farm in Norway\nLINK9B EVOLVING \nAND NON-\nEVOLVING \nPOPULATIONS\n120\nCHAPTER 3 DNA MANIPULATION TECHNIQUES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS\n",
  "Page 133": "EXPLAIN\nPrevious methods of genetic engineering\nThe first genome editing  techniques were developed \ntowards the end of the 1900s. For many years, the \nmain technique used viruses as a way of inserting DNA into cells or rectifying \u2018mistakes\u2019 in the DNA of an individual. This was called gene therapy. However, this technique was imprecise, and so there were issues associated with it. The main concern was that there was no control over where the DNA was inserted. For example, it could enter in the middle of another gene in the DNA of the recipient organism and subsequently disrupt the normal code for making that gene\u2019s protein. That could have dire consequences for the survival of the organism.\nThe \u2018evolution\u2019 of genetic engineering \u2013 CRISPR-Cas9\nIn 2009, a pattern of DNA now known as CRISPR  (clustered regularly interspaced short \npalindromic repeat) was discovered in bacteria, and its use as a gene editing tool began. Breaking down the full name of CRISPR may help you to understand what it is.\n \u2022 Clustered \u2013 positioned close together\n \u2022 Regularly \u2013 present at particular intervals\n \u2022 Interspaced \u2013 a space between two things\n \u2022 Short \u2013 measuring a small distance from end to end\n \u2022 Palindromic \u2013 a word, or in this case a sequence, that reads the same forwards as it does \nbackwards\n \u2022 Repeat \u2013 present more than once.\nTherefore, CRISPR is a small sequence of a few nucleotides in DNA that is the same \nforwards and backwards, repeated one after the other, close together in regular intervals in \na genome.\nThe role of CRISPR-Cas9 in bacteria\nThese sequences of DNA were discovered in E. coli bacteria in 1987. However, it was not until 2007 that their role in defence against bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) was determined. \nCRISPR-Cas9  has been used to edit DNA in various organisms, including \nhumans, since around 2012.\nCRISPR is a group of nucleotides that codes for short sequences of RNA. A CRISPR-\nassociated enzyme, called Cas9 , is able to cut at a specific region of the DNA, determined by \nsequences of RNA, called guide RNA (gRNA) . Each gRNA contains 20 nucleotides that are \nable to bind to a complementary sequence of a strand of DNA nucleotides after it unwinds the DNA. The endonuclease, Cas9, has two active sites (regions that can bind to DNA) and is able to cut both strands of DNA at the sugar\u2013phosphate backbone, like a restriction enzyme would. At this point, the cell\u2019s natural DNA repair mechanisms act, doing one (or both) of the following:\n \u2022 adding nucleotides that alter the sequence of DNA\n \u2022 inserting a short region of DNA with a specific nucleotide sequence.Figure 3D\u20132 Gene delivery using a viral vector to transfer \nDNA into a human host is an imprecise method.\nCRISPR \na section of DNA containing short repetitions of nucleotides, involved in bacterial defence against viruses\nCRISPR-Cas9 an immune system in bacteria that uses CRISPR nucleotide sequences and the Cas9 DNA-cutting enzyme, also modified for use as a genome editing tool\nCas9 \nan endonuclease (enzyme) that cuts DNA at a specific point determined by guide RNA (gRNA)\nGuide RNA (gRNA) \na specific RNA sequence that recognises the desired DNA and directs the Cas enzyme there to cut DNAGenome editing (also referred to as gene editing) the insertion, removal or replacement of DNA within the genome of a living cell\nVIDEO 3D\u20131 \nCRISPR-CAS9\nWORKSHEET 3D\u20131 STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF CRISPR-CAS9\nDOC\n121 3D THE FUTURE  OF GENOME  EDITING\n",

This is ideal for removing specific genes.\nIn bacteria, cutting up viral genetic material ensures that the virus can no longer replicate \nand damage the bacteria. (You will learn about viruses in Section 6C.) The Cas9 enzyme can include regions of the viral DNA by inserting them into the CRISPR sequence, so the bacteria have a memory of past infections by the same virus. The CRISPR nucleotide sequence is also passed on to daughter bacterial cells when the bacteria reproduce by binary fission, so they also have a memory of the virus.\nLINK6C NON-\nCELLULAR \nPATHOGENS\nFigure 3D\u20133 The CRISPR-Cas9 system allows scientists to delete, disrupt or insert DNA within \nthe genome of a living organism.

  "Page 135": "The future of CRISPR-Cas9\nThe development of the \nCRISPR-Cas9 system means that the gRNA nucleotides can be built artificially. Therefore, a scientist can essentially design a sequence to match any specific sequence of nucleotides in DNA and control where in another organism\u2019s DNA the Cas9 enzyme will cut. Unlike the use of viruses for gene editing, as described earlier, this technique allows genetic engineers to remove a faulty allele (version of a gene) and insert a normal functioning allele with extreme precision, thereby giving the organism a therapeutic benefit.\nOther potential uses of CRISPR-Cas9\nWhen scientists discovered the advantages of CRISPR, including that the process is cheap, easy and accurate, they soon discovered how it could be reprogrammed to edit the genomes of different species. Research in manipulating the role of CRISPR-Cas9 has included the following breakthroughs:\n \u2022 One of the two active sites of the Cas9 enzyme can be deactivated and new enzymes \nadded. The Cas9 then transports these enzymes to a specific DNA sequence. This means scientists can alter a single nucleotide, so an allele that causes a disorder can be removed, or a nucleotide that results in a stop codon being produced in mRNA transcribed from that DNA can be introduced.\n \u2022 Adding transcription activators that attach \nto either the Cas9 enzyme or the gRNA and encourage RNA polymerase to bind more readily to the DNA results in an increased rate of transcription. Alternatively, a gene can be silenced by incorporating more factors that block the action of RNA polymerase in transcription.\n \u2022Fluorescent proteins can be added to the Cas9, which allows scientists to locate a specific gene in an organism\u2019s genome and/or follow this gene and the chromosome it is on through cell division.\n \u2022 Several diseases can be treated, including \nediting cancer genes and potential for removing HIV genes from sufferers.Figure 3D\u20134 Crystal structure of the CRISPR-associated protein Cas9\nFigure 3D\u20135 Jennifer Doudna (right) and Emmanuelle Charpentier \n(left) were awarded a Nobel Prize in 2020 for inventing the revolutionary gene-editing tool CRISPR-Cas9.\nLINK2B THE GENETIC \nCODE AND GENE EXPRESSION\n123 3D THE FUTURE  OF GENOME  EDITING\n",

A nucleotide sequence from the virus is incorporated into the bacterium\u2019s CRISPR sequence as a \u2018memory\u2019 , so the next time that virus is encountered, the bacterium produces gRNA, which directs Cas9 to cut the viral gene up into pieces.\nThis function can be applied to genome editing in live cells in the laboratory, through \nthe following steps and diagram:\n1\n Guide RNA is created to \nmatch the desired gene sequence to be edited.\n2\n This gRNA, along with Cas9, is injected into the cell.\n3\n When the guide RNA binds to its target gene sequence, the active sites of the Cas9 enzyme make a precise cut in the organism\u2019s DNA.\n4\n The cell\u2019s own DNA repair enzymes repair the break.\n5\n Scientists can manipulate the repair enzymes to delete or disrupt the gene at the repair site, thereby preventing a harmful gene from being expressed.

Also, gRNA is 20 nucleotides long, compared to a recognition site, which is only 4\u20136 nucleotides long.

However, this was 44 years after the first enzyme, diastase, was discovered by the French chemist Anselme Payen. Although this was the first recorded instance of an enzyme being discovered, enzyme use was documented in history much earlier than this. One such example comes from Homer\u2019s Iliad, which outlines a process for cheese making that must have involved the use of enzymes. Since these early beginnings, our knowledge of enzymes has changed significantly, due largely to the applications of new technology. In this section, we will examine the structure and function of enzymes and how they are involved in biochemical pathways in organisms.\n \nFigure 4A\u20131 Wilhelm K\u00fchne (left) and Anselme Payen (right)\nEXPLAIN\nBiochemical pathways\nIn Chapter 5, you will learn more about the metabolic processes of photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Both these processes are examples of biochemical pathways. A biochemical pathway involves a series of reactions, each catalysed by \nenzymes , where the \nproduct of one reaction is the substrate  (or starting material) for the next reaction.\nThe easiest way to understand this is by using an illustrated example. Imagine a biochemical pathway that involves four molecules: A, B, C and D. In this pathway, molecule A is converted to B, B to C and, finally, C to D. Each of these transformations occurs via a separate reaction, LINK CHAPTER 5Substrate \na molecule that binds to the active site of an enzyme and then takes part in a reaction; also referred to as a reactantEnzyme a type of protein, also referred to as a biological catalyst, that speeds up reactions within an organism by lowering activation energy\n135 4A THE ROLE  OF ENZYMES\n\u00a9 ambridge University Press 2021",

The colours indicate that molecule B is both the product of enzyme reaction 1 (blue) and the substrate of enzyme reaction 2 (green), and so on.and each reaction is catalysed by a separate enzyme: 1, 2 and 3 respectively. This pathway is \nshown in Figure 4A\u20132a.\nLINK UNIT 1One of the advantages and key features of biochemical pathways is that they are often able to regulate themselves. Generally, this happens through one of the final products (such as molecule D in Figure 4A\u20132b) inhibiting the function of one of the earlier enzymes in the pathway (such as Enzyme 1 in Figure 4A\u20132b). This is an example of a negative feedback loop, which you would have learned about in Unit 1. These biochemical pathways and the regulation that keeps them in check are important for a number of reasons. As an example, this mechanism ensures that a cell is only producing molecules that it needs and not one that it already has in sufficient amounts. This makes the processes more efficient and helps save time, energy and resources. This inhibition effect is shown in Figure 4A\u20132b.\nWhat are enzymes?\nEnzymes are a class of proteins and are known as biological \ncatalysts . In chemistry and \nbiology, a catalyst is a molecule that increases the rate of a chemical reaction. All chemical reactions have an energy threshold that needs to be overcome in order for the reaction to occur. This threshold is known as the \nactivation energy  \nand is shown in Figure 4A\u20133.\nEnzymes speed up or catalyse \nchemical reactions within organisms by lowering this activation energy (Figure 4A\u20133). This means less energy is required for the reaction to take place and therefore the reaction can occur more frequently.

  "Page 149": "In enzyme-mediated reactions, the reactants are referred to as the substrate. For \nthe reaction to occur, the substrate must successfully bind to the enzyme at its \nactive site , which will be talked about in depth shortly. The active site allows more \nsuccessful collisions between substrates in a reaction than would normally occur without the presence of an enzyme.\nOnce the substrate has bound to the active site, there are two main categories of \nreaction that can take place, as shown in Figure 4A\u20134.\nIf a larger substrate is broken down into smaller products, the reaction is referred \nto as \ncatabolic . Catabolic reactions release energy, so the products have less energy than \nthe reactants. An example of a biological reaction that is catabolic is cellular respiration, which you will learn more about in Section 5C. On the other hand, if the reaction involves smaller substrates being built up into larger products, the reaction is referred to as \nanabolic . \nAnabolic reactions require energy, so the energy of the products is greater than the reactants. An example of an anabolic reaction is the formation of a dipeptide from two amino acids, which was discussed in Section 2C.\nAs you can see in Figure 4A\u20134, the substrate binds to a specific area on the enzyme. \nAs mentioned previously, this is known as the active site, and its shape and charge are critical for the enzyme to function.LINK5C CELLULAR \nRESPIRATION\nAnabolic \ndescribes a type of chemical reaction that requires energy and involves constructing molecules from simpler components\n Energy\nreleased\nEnergy requiredEnergy (arbitrary units)\nProgress of reactionReactants\nProducts\nAnabolic reactions: building larger molecules from smaller ones, requiring energy inputEnergy (arbitrary units)\nProgress of reactionReactantsProductsSubstrate\nProducts\nEnzyme Enzyme\nSubstratesProduct\nEnzyme EnzymeEnzyme\u2013substrate\ncomplexCatabolic reactions: breaking down large molecules into smaller ones with the release of energy\nFigure 4A\u20134 Catabolic reactions involve breaking down molecules and releasing energy.

For enzymes, two main parts of the structure are particularly relevant: the active site and the \nallosteric site  (Figure 4A\u20135).LINK 2C PROTEINSAllosteric site \na binding site on an enzyme, where molecules other than the substrate may bind\nActive site\nAllosteric site\nEnzyme\nAllosteric\nsiteInhibitorActive siteSubstrate\nAllostericsiteActive sitea\nb C\nSubstrate\n(reactants)\nEnzyme Enzyme\nFigure 4A\u20135 a The generalised structure of an enzyme, showing both the active site and the allosteric site.  \nb A 3D structural representation of an enzyme, showing the substrate binding to the active site, which it can do as long as the allosteric site is unoccupied. c When an inhibitor (to be discussed in Section 4B) binds to the allosteric site, it changes the shape of the active site so the substrate can no longer bind to it.\n4B FACTORS \nIMPACTING \nON ENZYME \nFUNCTIONLINK\nLINK 2C PROTEINSThe allosteric site is another binding site on an enzyme, but it is not for the substrate to \nbind to. The allosteric site will be discussed in more detail in Section 4B in relation to enzyme inhibitors.\nThe active site is the part of an enzyme where the substrate binds. It is important to \nrealise that the shape and charge of the active site are unique to each enzyme and are complementary for the substrate that binds to it. This feature is what provides enzymes with a high level of specificity for their substrate. In Section 2C, we discussed the general structures of amino acids. The R group is the part of the amino acid structure that makes each amino acid unique. These R groups are very important during the interaction of an enzyme with its substrate. The specific amino acid residues found in the active site help determine the specificity of the enzyme, through having R groups that will only interact and bind with the substrate. As the active site is critical for the enzyme to function, we will now discuss the interaction between the enzyme and the substrate in more detail.\nDOCWORKSHEET \n4A\u20131 ENZYME \nFUNCTIONS\n138\nCHAPTER 4 ENZYMES\n\u00a9 ambridge University Press 2021",
  "Page 151": "The lock-and-key mechanism describes the situation where the shape of the substrate \nis a perfect fit for the unique shape of the active site of the enzyme. This is illustrated in Figure 4A\u20136. It can also be seen in this figure that the enzyme will not function unless the correct complementary substrate binds perfectly to the active site. This again highlights the high level of specificity of the enzyme\u2013substrate interaction.\nThe second mechanism, called the induced-fit model, is very similar to the lock-and-\nkey mechanism, but with one small difference. Initially, the substrate is able to bind to the active site of the enzyme, as the two have complementary shapes and charges. In contrast to the lock-and-key model, the initial conformation of the active site is not a perfect fit for the substrate. However, upon binding of the substrate, the active site of the enzyme is able to alter its shape to mould around the substrate (Figure 4A\u20136).\nNote that there isn\u2019t one right or wrong model for the binding of the substrate to an enzyme. \nIn reality, both situations probably occur to some degree within organisms, and different enzymes may use different mechanisms. What is critical is that you understand the overall importance of the complementary nature of an enzyme\u2019s active site and its substrate.Induced-\ufb01t modelLock-and-key model\nSubstrate\nActive site\nEnzymeLock (enzyme) Key (substrate)\nEnzyme\u2013substrate\nComplexLock\u2013key complex\nSubstrate\nEnzymeActivesite\nFigure 4A\u20136 The lock-and-key model (top) and the induced-fit model (bottom) for a substrate binding \nto an enzymeEnzyme\u2013substrate interactions\nFor a reaction to begin, the substrate must first bind to the enzyme.

  "Page 152": "The role of coenzymes \nSome enzymes require additional help from other molecules to enable them to function \noptimally. These other molecules are referred to as coenzymes , which are organic molecules \nthat contain carbon and hydrogen, which do not get used up as part of the reaction. Examples are NADP, NAD and FAD, all of which will be explored further in Sections 5A and 5C.\nCoenzymes can function via two different mechanisms: they can activate the enzyme \nby interacting with it and altering the shape of the active site; or they can act as electron carriers, taking electrons to the active site and transferring them to the substrate. You will learn more about electron-carrying coenzymes in later chapters, in particular NADP (for photosynthesis), NAD and FAD (for cellular respiration).\n4A SKILLS\nConnecting conceptsAs you will have noticed in this chapter, there is a large overlap with the concepts discussed in Chapter 2, when we talked about genes and proteins. You may have noticed that the nature of protein synthesis is important for the formation of enzymes, which are all proteins. Similarly, you may have realised that the structures of proteins are critical for dictating the shape of the active site, which is very important for how the enzyme functions. In Chapter 9, you will learn about how even minor variations (mutations) in the protein sequence can reduce the activity of an enzyme or, in some cases, cause it to cease functioning altogether.\nEven though you often learn these topics independently, it is important that you are able \nto connect related concepts. There are a number of approaches you can use to help build a complete understanding, including the ability to identify and explain relationships. These include:1 \n Concept maps. These are used throughout this textbook, as a way of graphically illustrating the connected nature of the content that you are learning (both within a topic and between topics). Throughout the book there are also markers showing when links between chapters occur. These are designed to help you understand these \nconnections. Developing a large concept map of your own, which can be stuck on \nyour wall, can act as both a reminder of how to join ideas t\nogether from different \nsections of the course and as a checklist for your studies.\n2  Answering connected questions. It is important to practise answering questions that require you to use your knowledge of multiple areas. You will find questions like this throughout this textbook, particularly at the end of sections, chapters and units.

  "Page 154": "EXPLAIN\nFactors impacting on enzyme function\nTemperature\nTemperature is one of the most \nimportant factors that control the activity of an enzyme. All enzymes have an optimal temperature \u2013 that is, the temperature at which they function best. For most enzymes within the human body, it makes sense that this temperature is around 37\u00b0C. However, organisms that thrive in hotter environments (such as Thermus aquaticus) have enzymes that work optimally at much higher temperatures.\nThe impact of temperature differs \ndepending on whether it is above or below the optimal temperature. This is highlighted in Figure 4B\u20131, which shows the rate of reaction for a typical human enzyme across a temperature range.  Factors impacting on enzyme function\nStudy Design:\nThe general factors that impact on enzyme function in relation to photosynthesis and cellular respiration: changes in temperature, pH, concentration, competitive and non-competitive enzyme inhibitorsGlossary:Competitive inhibitionDenaturationEnzyme saturationInhibitorNon-competitive inhibition\n4B \nENGAGE\nSome (enzymes) like it hot\nIn the previous chapter, you learned about the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This \ntechnique is used to amplify DNA, producing many copies of a target sequence, and is regularly employed in areas such as forensic science and paternity testing. The enzyme most commonly used in PCR is called DNA Taq polymerase. The word \u2018Taq\u2019 is derived from the organism that this enzyme was isolated from, Thermus aquaticus. T. aquaticus \nis a type of bacterium that can be classed as a thermophile, which means it is capable of surviving at extremely high temperatures. Indeed, T. aquaticus was first discovered in hot springs in Yellowstone National Park, USA, and can survive at temperatures of 55\u2013100\u00b0C. It is the ability of the Taq polymerase enzyme to function at such high temperatures that makes it useful for PCR, which requires significant heat to first separate the two strands of DNA.\nHowever, as you will see in this section, many other enzymes have optimal conditions, \noutside of which they function slowly, or not at all. Specifically, we will be investigating how factors such as temperature, pH, concentration and inhibition impact on the activity of enzymes.LINK3A COMMON \nDNA TOOLS AND \nTECHNIQUES\nAs temperature\nincreases, the rate\nof reaction increasesmore quickly\n0Optimal temperature\nEnzymes becoming\ndenaturedRate of reaction (arbitrary units)\nTemperature (\u00b0C)Above the optimum\ntemperature, therate of reactiondecreases quickly\nEnzymescompletelydenatured\n10 20 30 40 50 60\nFigure 4B\u20131 The rate of reaction for a typical human enzyme  \nacross a range of temperaturesPPS\n142\nCHAPTER 4 ENZYMES\n\u00a9 ambridge University Press 2021",
  "Page 155": "How can the shape of this curve be explained in terms of what is happening with the \nenzymes at a molecular level?\nEnzyme activity below optimal temperature\nFigure 4B\u20131 shows that at low temperatures the enzyme activity is reduced. As the temperature increases from 0\u00b0C towards the optimal temperature, the enzyme activity (and so the rate of reaction) also increases. The explanation for this involves understanding the relationship between temperature and the kinetic energy (related to speed of vibration or other movement) that molecules have. The faster something is moving or vibrating, the more kinetic energy it has. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of atoms and molecules, and adding heat energy raises their speed, kinetic energy and therefore temperature (Figure 4B\u20132).\nAdding\nheat energy\nLower\ntemperatureHigher\ntemperature\nFigure 4B\u20132 Adding heat energy to a solution leads to increased speed of movement and kinetic \nenergy of particles and higher temperature (or a change of physical state). This helps explain why heating can lead to an increase in enzyme activity, until the optimal temperature is reached.\nHowever, how is the speed at which these molecules are moving around related to the \nrate at which they function? Imagine that you and a friend are in your Biology classroom, blindfolded and told to walk around for a 10-minute experiment. You are told to keep count of the number of times you collide with each other, as this will represent every time that a substrate and enzyme interact with each other. Now imagine doing this experiment a second time, but instead of walking, you are told to run around as fast as you can.\nIn which experiment do you think you would bump into each other more often? The \nmost likely answer would be experiment number 2. By thinking about it this way, you can appreciate why an increase in temperature may lead to an increase in enzyme activity.\nAs discussed in Section 4A, an enzyme requires the binding of a substrate at its active site \nfor it to function. For this to happen, the molecules first need to collide. Importantly, not only do they need to collide, but they need to interact in such a way that the substrate binds successfully with the active site of the enzyme. From this you may realise that, while many things need to go right for an enzyme reaction to occur, the greater the kinetic energy of both the enzyme and the substrate, the more likely it is to occur.\nEnzyme activity above the optimal temperature\nAs can be seen in Figure 4B\u20131, when the temperature exceeds the optimal temperature, there is a sharp decrease in the rate of reaction. To understand what is happening under these conditions, it is important to remember this important fact: enzymes are proteins. In Section 2C, the role of proteins and the importance of their structure was discussed.LINK4A THE ROLE \nOF ENZYMESVIDEO 4B\u20131 \nFACTORS AFFECTING ENZYME ACTIVITY\nPPSWORKSHEET 4B\u20131  \nFACTORS AFFECTING ENZYME ACTIVITYDOC\nLINK 2C PROTEINS\n143 4B FACTORS  IMPACT ING ON ENZYME  FuNCTION\n\u00a9 ambridge University Press 2021",

A pH of less than 7 is acidic, \n7 is neutral and greater than 7 is basic. pH is measured on a scale between 0 and 14 \u2013 values closer to 0 are highly acidic, and closer to 14 are highly basic (Figure 4B\u20134).\nThe pH of various environments within an organism are tightly regulated through \nhomeostatic mechanisms. As an example, in humans:\n \u2022blood pH ~ 7.4\n \u2022stomach pH ~ 2.5\n \u2022saliva pH ~ 7.0\n \u2022bile pH ~ 7.5.At higher temperatures, the hydrogen bonds and interactions that form the tertiary \nstructure of a protein begin to break down due to increasing vibrations in the molecules. When this occurs, we say that the enzyme is being denatured and the process is called \ndenaturation . This process is permanent, so once an enzyme is denatured it will not function \nproperly again. So why does this process have such a profound impact on the activity of an enzyme? It is easiest to illustrate this by looking at what happens in a series of steps:1 \n At the optimal temperature, binding of the substrate occurs normally.\n2  As the temperature increases beyond the optimum, the enzyme\u2019s 3D conformational structure changes.\n3 \n The specific structure of the active site begins to disappear, which means that the substrate is no longer complementary and cannot bind.\n4 \n Enzyme activity becomes zero, as substrate interaction is no longer possible.Denaturation \nthe process by which a protein loses its 3D conformational structure through breaking of hydrogen bonds, caused by an external stress such as temperature or pH\nSubstrate\nEnzymeActive\nsite\nDenaturedenzymeUnchangedsubstrateleavesenzyme\nSubstrate cannot\nenter active site\nHeat\nFigure 4B\u20133 An increase in temperature denatures the enzyme, which leads to a change in the \nconformation of the active site, so the substrate is unable to bind and the enzyme is unable to function.\nCheck-in questions \u2013 Set 1\n1  What level of protein structure determines the shape of the active site of an enzyme?\n2  What is the general name for a molecule that binds to the active site of an enzyme? \nWhat properties of the active site allow this molecule to bind to it?\n3  What is the name of the process whereby a protein permanently loses its 3D conformational structure?\n4  What is the main reason that denaturation leads to a loss of enzyme function?\n5  Why does enzyme function increase when temperature goes from low to optimal?PPS\n144\nCHAPTER 4 ENZYMES\n\u00a9 ambridge University Press 2021",

Figure 4B\u20135 shows a summary of how a number of enzymes in the body function at different pH levels.\nTwo important points are demonstrated \nby Figure 4B\u20135. First, different enzymes within the body function at different optimal pH values. As mentioned previously, the pH values of different environments vary greatly within organisms. Therefore, it is not surprising that enzymes have an optimal pH that suits the environment that they function in. For example, pepsin (an enzyme found in the stomach) has an optimal pH of 1.5\u20132, which suits the acidic nature of gastric juices. In contrast, salivary amylase works best at a pH of around 6.5, which is appropriate for the neutral pH environment of the mouth.\nSecond, the rate of reaction on either side of the optimal pH changes quickly. At pH values \nthat are either too acidic or too basic (i.e. below or above the optimal pH), the rate of reaction or enzyme activity level drops quickly. This is due to the fact that in these unsuitable pH conditions, the enzyme begins to denature. This process is the same as for the loss of enzyme function at temperatures above optimal, but in this case the cause of denaturation is a pH that is either too high or too low. Therefore, the steps outlined earlier become as follows:1 \n At the optimal pH, binding of the substrate occurs normally.\n2  As pH changes to below or above the optimum (becomes too acidic or too basic), the enzyme\u2019s 3D conformational shape changes.\n3 \n The specific structure of the active site begins to disappear, which means that the substrate is no longer complementary and no longer binds\n4 \n Enzyme activity becomes zero, as substrate interaction is no longer possible.\nThis illustrates that having a standard, structured answer can be really helpful in describing common processes. You will find a similar strategy useful in other topics, such as when describing the process of natural selection.Pepsin        \n(optimal pH 1.5\u20132)Salivary amylase\n(optimal pH 6\u20137)\nAlkaline phosphatase\n(optimal pH 8\u201310)\n8Rate of reaction\npH1 2 3 4 5 6 7 910\nFigure 4B\u20135 The effect of pH on the rate of reactions catalysed by \ndifferent enzymes within the human body\nLINK9B EVOLVING \nAND NON-EVOLVING POPULATIONS\n145 4B FACTORS  IMPACTI NG ON ENZYME  FuNCTION\n\u00a9 ambridge University Press 2021",
  "Page 158": "As well as altering the shape of the active site, changes in pH can also impact on the \ncharge of the active site. The substrate and the active site can bind through the attraction of opposite charges (positive and negative). However, if the pH causes these charges to change, that attraction can decrease or actually lead to the substrate being repelled from the active site. This is another mechanism through which changes in pH away from the optimum can cause a decrease in enzyme activity.\nConcentration\nAs you have seen previously, the activity of an enzyme requires both the enzyme and a substrate. Therefore, the concentration of each of these components affects the overall activity. Let\u2019s look at each of these situations separately.\nSubstrate concentration\nThe effect of substrate concentration can be seen  \nin Figure 4B\u20136. In this scenario, assume there is a fixed (limited) number of enzymes available to use  \nin the reaction.\nThe initial part of this graph indicates that adding \nmore substrate results in an increased rate of reaction. However, at a certain substrate concentration (shown by the dotted line), the curve begins to flatten out. Why do you think this might be?\nThis can be understood by considering the \nsituation shown in Figure 4B\u20138. Increasing the substrate concentration increases the rate of reaction until a certain point, but then flattens out or plateaus. At this point, every available enzyme \nhas substrate bound to the active site. This is known as \nenzyme saturation . Adding more \nsubstrate at this point (just like adding more than ten students to the room) does nothing to increase the rate of the reaction, as there is nowhere for this excess substrate to bind to.\nEnzyme concentration\nThe rates of reactions during photosynthesis and cellular respiration, processes that will be explored in Sections 5B and 5D, can also be affected by altering the enzyme concentration. In organisms, the amount or expression levels of a protein within a cell can be raised or lowered through gene regulation, as you learned in Section 2D.\nFigure 4B\u20137 shows two possible outcomes of changing enzyme concentrations. \nInitially,\u00a0it may seem confusing as to how we could obtain two very different graphs.

In the final panel of Figure 4B\u20138, there were 20 students, but only 10 computers. In this situation, if the number of computers were increased to 20, this would also increase the rate at which the task of typing out the textbook was completed (since each person is working on a different section). The process could continue to be accelerated by adding more and more computers to the room. However, this would only work if there was also an endless supply of students to type on them.PPS1  Imagine a room contains 10 computers. In this \nroom, a single student is working on one of the computers, attempting to type out a complete copy of this textbook.

  "Page 161": "Enzyme inhibition\nAlmost all biological processes \nin the body need to be regulated, and enzyme function is no exception. An important mechanism to regulate the function of an enzyme is to inhibit its activity. There are many ways in which inhibition can happen, but there are two in particular that you need to know for this course: \ncompetitive \ninhibition  and non-competitive \ninhibition .\nCompetitive inhibition\nAs you will remember from Section 4A, an enzyme\u2019s active site is critical to its ability to function. The active site is the location where the substrate binds to the enzyme, allowing the reaction to take place (Figure 4B\u201310). In the previous section, you learnt how this mechanism is often described as being like a lock and a key. If this analogy is taken further, imagine that a person returned home one day and found that someone had jammed something into the lock of their front door. In this case, the key would no longer be able to fit and the person wouldn\u2019t be able to unlock and open their door.\nThe same principle governs competitive inhibition. In competitive inhibition, an \ninhibitor  \nbinds to the active site of the enzyme instead of the substrate. It is able to do this because \nit has a shape and charge that mimic the substrate (or a complementary shape and charge to the active site), thus fitting the active site (Figure 4B\u201310). In this situation, the inhibitor and the substrate compete to bind to the active site, which is why this process is referred to as competitive inhibition. With the inhibitor bound, the substrate is unable to access the active site and the enzyme can\u2019t function.\nNon-competitive inhibition\nNon-competitive inhibition has some similarities to competitive inhibition. Both result in the substrate being unable to bind to the active site and, therefore, both also prevent enzymes from functioning to their full potential. However, non-competitive inhibition differs from competitive inhibition in one key way: the part of the enzyme that the inhibitor binds to. As the name suggests, non-competitive inhibition does not involve the inhibitor competing with the substrate for binding to the active site. Instead, a non-competitive inhibitor binds to the allosteric site. When the inhibitor attaches to the allosteric site, it causes the active site to change shape (Figure 4B\u201311). As you will remember from Section 4A, the interaction between the active site and a substrate is highly specific. Once the active site changes shape through the action of the non-competitive inhibitor, the substrate is no longer able to fit within the active site and, in this way, the enzyme activity is decreased.\nIt is possible to distinguish between these two types of inhibition by analysing what \nhappens to the activity of an enzyme when the substrate concentration is increased (Figure 4B\u201312). In the presence of a competitive inhibitor, the rate of reaction can be\u00a0restored by simply increasing the substrate concentration.  Competitive \ninhibition the process of disrupting the function of an enzyme by blocking its active site with a molecule other than the substrate\nNon-competitive \ninhibition the process of disrupting the function of an enzyme through a molecule binding to another site on the enzyme, which alters the shape of the active site in such a way that the substrate cannot bindLINK4A THE ROLE \nOF ENZYMES Normal enzyme reaction\nCompetitive inhibitionSubstrate Enzyme Enzyme Enzyme\u2013substrate complexProducts\nEnzyme Substrate Enzyme\u2013inhibitor\ncomplexInhibitorSTOP\nInhibitor binds to active\nsite, directly blocking it\nFigure 4B\u201310 The normal function of an enzyme can be blocked through \ncompetitive inhibition, where an inhibitor interacts with the active site, blocking the substrate from binding.\nInhibitor \na molecule that is involved in disrupting the function of an enzyme, either directly (competitive) or indirectly (non-competitive)\n149 4B FACTORS  IMPACT ING ON ENZYME  FuNCTION\n\u00a9 ambridge University Press 2021",

Not all enzymes have an allosteric site, but if they have, and if an inhibitor attaches to it, then it causes the active site to change shape.\nThis is possible because the substrate and the \ncompetitive inhibitor are both attempting to bind to the active site of the enzyme. Therefore, adding more substrate to the reaction allows it to \u2018outcompete\u2019 the inhibitor and preferentially bind to the active site of the enzyme. The same thing is not true for a non-competitive inhibitor. Remember in this instance the non-competitive inhibitor is binding to the allosteric site, not the active site, but the 3D conformational shape of the active site is altered. Therefore, increasing the substrate concentration has little effect on the rate of reaction, as the substrate will be unable to bind to the altered active site.\n Competitive inhibitor\nNon-competitive inhibitorRate of reacation\nSubstrate concentrationNormal enzyme\nFigure 4B\u201312 Increasing substrate concentration \ncan distinguish between competitive and  non-competitive inhibition.\n4B SKILLS\nData analysis\nYou have seen throughout this chapter that graphs are commonly used to assess the impact of different factors on enzyme activity and function. Using graphs to help illustrate your answers and analysing data to form conclusions are vital skills in your understanding of this material. Let\u2019s look at examples of both.\nExample 1: Using a graph to help illustrate an answer\nQuestion:\nExplain the effect that pH has on the function of an enzyme.\nStrategy: In these situations, it is important to annotate your graph to highlight the key \npoints that you are referring to in the text. For example, as well as having the optimal pH indicated, you could also have text on either side of this saying \u2018enzyme denaturation\u2019.VIDEO 4B\u20132 \nSKILLS: DATA \nANALYSIS\n150\nCHAPTER 4 ENZYMES\n\u00a9 ambridge University Press 2021",
  "Page 163": "Sample response:\nThe effect of pH on the function of an \nenzyme is illustrated in the diagram on the right.\nIt can be seen from this graph that this \nenzyme has an optimal pH of around 6.5. However, on either side of the optimal pH (too acidic or too basic), the enzyme activity decreases quickly. This is because the enzyme denatures, which means that it loses its 3D conformational structure. As the 3D structure changes due to hydrogen bonds breaking, so does the active site, which means the substrate can no longer bind to the enzyme. As the substrate can\u2019t bind, the enzyme can no longer function.\nExample 2: Analysing data to form conclusions\nQuestion:\nThe data in the table is from an experiment \nmeasuring the rate of a reaction at different temperatures. The reaction is catalysed by  an enzyme and produces carbon dioxide.  The reaction was allowed to proceed for  five minutes and the data was recorded.  Using your knowledge of enzymes, explain  the observations of this experiment.\nStrategy: The first step in answering this question is to isolate what you are being asked. The question indicates that this is an enzyme-catalysed reaction and that you are observing the effect of temperature. As carbon dioxide is a product of the reaction, you can assume that the greater the volume of carbon dioxide being produced, the higher the rate of reaction, or that the enzyme activity levels are higher. It is important that you answer this question in two parts. First, clearly state the results that are observed, and then explain these results using your knowledge of enzyme theory.\nSample answer:\nThe data from this experiment indicates that the enzyme has an optimal temperature \nof approximately 35\u00b0C, as this is the temperature at which the highest volume (25 mL) of carbon dioxide is produced. At temperatures higher than 35\u00b0C, the amount of carbon dioxide produced decreases greatly. At 50\u00b0C, almost no carbon dioxide is produced. This indicates that, at temperatures greater than 35\u00b0C, the enzyme begins to denature. During this process, the enzyme loses its 3D conformational structure and so also loses the structure of its active site. Once this happens, the substrate will no longer be able to bind to the enzyme. As the substrate cannot bind to the enzyme, the reaction barely occurs, which explains why almost no carbon dioxide is produced at 50\u00b0C.\nIt is critically important that you pay attention to the labelling of graph axes.

Cell survival depends on cells being able to respond to changes in their environment, and without enzymes regulating these biochemical pathways this would not be possible. This chapter examines two biochemical pathways that are integral to life on Earth: photosynthesis and cellular respiration. The general structure of each pathway from reactants to products, as well as the specific location, inputs and outputs of the different stages are explored. With an understanding of the role of enzymes and assisting coenzymes, the efficiency of each process and the factors that affect their rate of reaction will be covered.

Recall from Unit 1 that living things are constantly active: gaining oxygen, water and nutrients; removing waste products; and maintaining their internal environments (pH and temperature). It is energy that does the work that sustains these activities.\nEnergy exists in different forms, but the forms of energy that are most important to life on \nEarth are sunlight (light energy), the chemical energy stored in food (like glucose), and heat. Cells and organisms carry out reactions to transform these forms of energy into forms they can use. For example:\n \u2022Autotrophs  capture and use light energy to convert water and carbon dioxide (inorganic) \ninto glucose (organic). This process is called photosynthesis .

Glucose can then be used as a source of energy by cells, \nenabling growth and reproduction. It is also involved in the synthesis of complex compounds necessary for survival. Any excess glucose can be stored by plant cells in the form of starch, for later use.\nFor photosynthesis to occur, a photosynthetic pigment called \nchlorophyll  (chloro = green, \nphyll = leaf) is required.

It is considered a waste product of photosynthesis.\n3\n Electrons released when light energy stimulates chlorophyll are used by ATP synthase, an enzyme embedded in the thylakoid membrane, to catalyse the synthesis of ATP from \nADP and Pi (inorganic phosphate).\n4 Hydrogen ions (also called protons) and some of the electrons released in the previous step are taken up by an acceptor molecule called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, or \nNADP+, which then forms NADPH.

This stage is \nalso referred to as the Calvin Cycle, carbon reduction or carbon fixation (because in this stage, the carbon-based molecules are \u2018fixed\u2019 together into glucose).1\n The cycle begins with a five-carbon molecule called RuBP  (ribulose bisphosphate), \nwhich is added to the CO2 from the atmosphere with the help of an enzyme called RuBP \ncarboxylase or Rubisco .\n2 The resulting compound breaks down into two compounds, called 3-phosphoglycerate (\nPGA).\n3 PGA is then converted into the carbohydrate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ( PGAL ) using \nNADPH and ATP.

There is some leniency around spelling; \nhowever, you must correctly spell any terms that are an explicit answer to a question.\nApplying your knowledge\nIn an examination you will be exposed to new information and research, and will \nbe expected to apply what you have learned over the year to these new situations. Examiners are not trying to trick you; they only want to assess your depth of understanding of particular concepts.\nAnother way in which you may be asked to apply your knowledge is through \ninterpreting diagrams that may seem unfamiliar. Again, everything you have covered in class is sufficient for you to answer the questions asked; you only need to figure out what the concept is that is being assessed, and what you know about this topic that is relevant.\nFor example, consider the diagrams in Figure 5A\u201310. Each represents a different way of \npresenting the inputs and outputs of photosynthesis, part of a dot point in your Study Design. See if you can determine what the question marks are in each diagram.\nTo improve your skills in this area, the more practice questions and examinations you  \ncan access (practice questions and examinations can be found in the digital resources), the more types of questions you will see assessing the same concepts but in a different way, and the less likely it is that you will be stumped in an examination or SAC.Check-in questions \u2013 Set 2\n1  Light energy is converted into what form of energy during photosynthesis?\n2 a   Name the collective term for the red/orange/yellow plant pigments that help chlorophyll harness light energy.\nb  Which two colours of the visible light spectrum are primarily absorbed by chlorophylls a and b?\n3  If one cycle of the Calvin Cycle makes one CH2O molecule, how many cycles will it take \nto build glucose (C6H12O6)?\n4 a   The light dependent reactions of photosynthesis supply the Calvin Cycle with which two molecules?\nb  Name the waste product of photosynthesis.\nc  Where does the Calvin Cycle take place?\nd  Name the stage of photosynthesis where carbon dioxide is used.\ne  Name the enzyme that catalyses the formation of PGA.\nVIDEO 5A\u20132 \nSKILLS: \nTERMINOLOGY \nAND \nABBREVIATIONS\nVIDEO 5A\u20133 \nSKILLS: \nAPPLYING YOUR \nKNOWLEDGE\n168\nCHAPTER 5 BIOCHEMICAL PATHWAYS: PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND CELLULAR RESPIRATION\nISBN 9 8-1-108-89462-3 \nPhot co yi g is restricted under law and this m erial must not be transferred to another party.\n",

The advantage of using a greenhouse is that the environment inside can be controlled, so the plants grow under the same optimal conditions all year round. But what are optimal conditions? Horticulturalists use their knowledge of the factors that affect the rate of photosynthesis to create an environment that allows plants to grow faster and make more food. They do this by using artificial lights, so that photosynthesis can continue day and night, and also at a higher light intensity. Paraffin heaters can also be used inside a greenhouse, because the burning paraffin produces carbon dioxide as well as heat, and both these factors can encourage a higher rate of photosynthesis.\nFigure 5B\u20131 Greenhouses limit the \nimpact of external factors on the rate of photosynthesis.\nRate \nthe speed at which a process occurs, or how quickly the reactants are used up and the products are created\nLINK5A PHOTO-\nSYNTHESISEXPLAIN\nThe rate of photosynthesis\nDefining \u2018rate\u2019\nThe rate of photosynthesis can be defined as the speed at which the process of \nphotosynthesis occurs \u2013 that is, the speed at which water and carbon dioxide are converted \ninto oxygen and (mainly) glucose.\nMeasuring the rate\nTo measure the rate of a reaction, either the concentration of a product that is formed (per unit of time) or the concentration of a reactant that is consumed (per unit of time) is measured.\nIn the case of photosynthesis, the rate of reaction can be measured by recording the oxygen \nproduction (oxygen is a product) or the carbon dioxide consumption (carbon dioxide is a reactant).\n \u2022Production of oxygen can be measured by, for example, collecting bubbles of oxygen, in the case of aquatic plants.\n \u2022Consumption of carbon dioxide can be measured by, for example, using pH indicators in the water of aquatic plants (because carbon dioxide is acidic, and as it is used up the pH will rise).\n172\nCHAPTER 5 BIOCHEMICAL PATHWAYS: PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND CELLULAR RESPIRATION\nISBN 9 8-1-108-89462-3 \nPhot co yi g is restricted under law and this m erial must not be transferred to another party.\n",
  "Page 185": "Factors that affect the rate of photosynthesis\nA limiting factor  is any factor that reduces the rate of photosynthesis when there is not \nenough of it. In the case of photosynthesis, the reactants are limiting factors, because \nin their absence, the reaction of photosynthesis cannot proceed. For example, a plant requires carbon dioxide, water, chlorophyll and light energy, so these are limiting factors. Additionally, photosynthesis is dependent on enzymes as they catalyse the different stages of the process. This means the factors that affect enzyme activity also affect the rate of photosynthesis \u2013 for example, temperature, pH and the concentration of the substrates,  as you learned in Section 4B. Here we consider the effect of light, temperature, water and carbon dioxide on the rate of photosynthesis as well as the interplay of these factors \u2013 the effects they have on one another.\nLight availability\nIncreased light intensity provides more light energy for the light dependent reactions of photosynthesis. Consequently, as light intensity increases, so does the rate of photosynthesis. However, at a certain point, the rate of photosynthesis plateaus. Assuming the plant has access to unlimited amounts of the reactants it needs, something else must be limiting the rate of photosynthesis at these high levels of light. In this case, it is the chloroplasts, as they reach their maximum rate of efficiency; that is, they are working as fast as they can. This means that any further increase in light intensity will have no effect on the speed of photosynthesis, and this is observed as a flattening of the curve or a plateau (as can be seen in Figure 5B\u20132).\nAt very high light intensities, the plant cannot continue to maintain its rate of \nphotosynthesis, because of the increasing temperature created by large amounts of light energy. Some of the visible light is converted to heat when absorbed, and sunlight includes \ninfrared light (that is, radiant heat). The effect of temperature is covered next.Limiting factor \nany factor that slows down the rate of photosynthesis when there is not enough of it, for example, carbon dioxide, water, chlorophyll and light energy\nLINK4B FACTORS \nIMPACTING ON ENZYME FUNCTION\nVIDEO 5B\u20131 FACTORS AFFECTING THE RATE OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS\nWORKSHEET 5B\u20131 LIGHT INTENSITY AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS\nDOCRate of photosynthesis\nincreases as light intensityincreases, when light intensityis at low\u2013medium levels Rate of photosynthesis\nreaches a plateau at high\nlight intensitiesRate of photosynthesis (arbitrary units)\nLight intensity (arbitrary units)\nFigure 5B\u20132 The effect of light intensity on the rate of photosynthesisPPS\n173 5B FACTORS  AFFECT ING THE RATE  OF PHOTOS YNTHESIS\nISBN 9 8-1-108-89462-3 \nPhot co yi g is restricted under law and this m erial must not be transferred to another party.\n",
  "Page 186": "Temperature\nAs photosynthesis is regulated by enzymes, and these are sensitive to changes in \ntemperature, the rate of photosynthesis is also affected when temperatures fluctuate. Increased temperatures lead to more kinetic energy and successful collisions between substrates and the active sites of enzymes, so the rate of photosynthesis increases. However, above an enzyme\u2019s optimal temperature, the enzyme begins to denature and the active site changes shape. Reactants (substrates) can no longer bind and form the enzyme\u2013substrate complex and the rate of photosynthesis quickly decreases.\nWater\nWater is not generally considered a limiting factor in photosynthesis because the amount needed is generally very small compared to the amount of water plants contain. However, in drought or hot weather, the plant may come under water stress. To prevent water loss, plants will close their stomata (tiny pores on the underside of their leaves). These pores are also the space through which gas exchange occurs, so the closing of the stomata also prevents carbon dioxide entering and oxygen leaving. Therefore, despite unlimited access to light intensity, there may not be enough carbon dioxide available to the plant to carry out photosynthesis. This is summarised in Figure 5B\u20134 and carbon dioxide concentration is considered after that. You will investigate what this means for the survival of plants when you learn about the adaptations of C\n3, C4 and CAM \nplants, later in this section.\nRate of\nphotosynthesis\ndecreasesDenaturation\nof enzymes\nHigh light\nintensityIncreasing\ntemperaturesIncreasing\nwater loss from\nstomataStomata close\nto reduce water\nlossCarbon dioxide\ncan no longer\nenter\nRate of\nphotosynthesis\ndecreases\nFigure 5B\u20134 Summarising the impact of high light intensity and its flow-on effects on other factors and on the rate \nof photosynthesisAs temperature\nincreases, the rate\n of photosynthesis\nincreases more\nquicklyOptimum\ntemperatureAbove the optimum\ntemperature, the\nrate of photosynthesis\nfalls quicklyRate of photosynthesis (arbitrary units)\nTemperature (arbitrary units)\nFigure 5B\u20133 The effect of temperature on the rate of photosynthesisPPS\n174\nCHAPTER 5 BIOCHEMICAL PATHWAYS: PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND CELLULAR RESPIRATION\nISBN 9 8-1-108-89462-3 \nPhot co yi g is restricted under law and this m erial must not be transferred to another party.\n",
  "Page 187": "Carbon dioxide concentration\nCarbon dioxide is involved in the fixation of carbon atoms to form the organic molecule \nglucose. More carbon dioxide means more reactant or substrate available for the light independent reactions. However, at a certain level, all the enzyme active sites responsible for carbon fixation are saturated and the reaction rate reaches a maximum. This means that any further increase in carbon dioxide concentration will have no effect on the rate of photosynthesis, which plateaus.\nFigure 5B\u20135 demonstrates how increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide does not lead \nto higher photosynthetic rates indefinitely. This is a good outcome, because there is a point at which high levels of carbon dioxide can be damaging to the plant as it creates an acidic environment.

  "Page 188": "Adaptations of C3, C4 and CAM plants\nMaximising the efficiency of photosynthesis\nSo far you have learned about the process of photosynthesis in C3 plants . But what are \nC3 plants? They are called \u2018C3 plants\u2019 because they form the 3C compound PGA during \ncarbon fixation. As you learned in Section 5A, they do this by fixing carbon dioxide from \nthe atmosphere to RuBP using the enzyme Rubisco. Approximately 85% of Earth\u2019s plants use C\n3 photosynthesis. C3 plants include crops like rice, cotton, rye, wheat, soybean, oats \nand all trees. They are usually found in temperate or cool and wet climates of approximately 15\u201325\u00b0C.\nAll plants, not just C\n3 plants, need to fix carbon dioxide using the Calvin Cycle during \nthe light independent stage of photosynthesis, in order to make glucose. This means \nthat all plants use the enzyme Rubisco to catalyse carbon fixation. Rubisco, however, is not very efficient, particularly in C\n3 plants. Oxygen acts as a competitive inhibitor for \nRubisco, so the rate of photosynthesis is reduced in the presence of oxygen. The series of reactions that occur when oxygen (not carbon dioxide) is the substrate for Rubisco is called \nphotorespiration . Photorespiration:\n \u2022forms a product that cannot be used to make glucose\n \u2022is an inefficient pathway, as it wastes energy\n \u2022reduces the efficiency of the Calvin Cycle, reducing the levels of photosynthesis by close to 25% in C\n3 plants.\nPlants get rid of oxygen to the atmosphere during photosynthesis, so normally oxygen won\u2019t bind to Rubisco and photorespiration shouldn\u2019t be a problem. However, on hot and dry days, or in desert and grassland environments, there is very little water, so C\n3 plants \nclose their stomata to conserve water. But closing their stomata also limits their access to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and prevents them getting rid of the waste product oxygen, produced during the light dependent stage of photosynthesis. This is when Rubisco starts to bind to the oxygen that is building up in the leaves, and photorespiration begins. The oxygen acts like a competitor to the carbon dioxide, and photorespiration competes with photosynthesis.\nC\n3 plants have no special adaptations to reduce such competition.LINK5A PHOTO-\nSYNTHESIS\nC3 plants \nplants that fix \nCO2 from the \natmosphere to form 3-phosphoglycerate or PGA, which contains three carbon atoms; are better suited to cooler and temperate climates; examples are rice, wheat, soybeans and cotton\nPhotorespiration the series of reactions that occur as a consequence of Rubisco using O\n2 as a substrate \ninstead of CO2; \nan inefficient process that cannot produce glucoseLINK4B FACTORS \nIMPACTING \nON ENZYME \nFUNCTION\nFigure 5B\u20136 Most plants use C3 photosynthesis\n176\nCHAPTER 5 BIOCHEMICAL PATHWAYS: PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND CELLULAR RESPIRATION\nISBN 9 8-1-108-89462-3 \nPhot co yi g is restricted under law and this m erial must not be transferred to another party.\n",

Working through Chapter 12 is a good starting point, but let\u2019s summarise some key terms and their meanings here, in the context of the information provided in a VCAA 2018 examination question.\nInformation provided: Elsa read that red algae survive at greater water depths than green algae do because of a \npigment in the red algae called phycoerythrin. This pigment enables the algae to absorb more of the geen light available at greater water depths. Elsa decided to investigate this by carrying out an experiment.\nUsing a standard technique, the single-celled algae were trapped in jelly balls. One set of \nballs contained green algae and another set contained red algae.\nTo measure the rate of photosynthesis, Elsa used a stopwatch and the pH indicator \nphenol red.

The microscopic parasite, called Henneguya salminicola, lives in salmon muscle tissue, an environment largely devoid of oxygen. It has evolved so that it doesn\u2019t need oxygen to produce ATP: it has literally stopped this critical biochemical pathway. Consequently, it has dropped its mitochondrial genome. Simply, the parasite is saving energy, as it doesn\u2019t need to copy genes and produce proteins for a process it doesn\u2019t use. Remember that it is the mitochondria that are responsible for converting glucose into ATP in most organisms during aerobic cellular respiration.\nWhat does this relative of the jellyfish do for \nenergy? This is not known, but one thought is that it steals it from the muscle tissue of the salmon. Other than that, researchers do not know for certain what processes or molecules H. salminicola uses. Until this new discovery, scientists were unsure whether organisms in the animal kingdom could survive in anaerobic (low-oxygen) environments. It was always assumed that the multicellular, highly developed organisms we know as animals first appeared on Earth because oxygen levels rose. How will an animal be categorised now?\nThis section explores the biochemical \npathways of cellular respiration, both aerobic (in the presence of oxygen) and anaerobic (in the absence of oxygen). You will learn about the main inputs and outputs of the processes, where they occur and the ATP yield.

Before investigating how glucose is used in cellular respiration, let\u2019s revise the role of ATP and the \nenergy shuttle .\nAs chemical reactions do not always occur in the same place within the cell, energy needs to be transferred between reactions. ATP enables this by acting as an energy shuttle.

It includes the Krebs Cycle and the electron transport chain, which both occur in the mitochondria.\n \u2022Anaerobic cellular respiration : occurs in the absence of oxygen. The products formed \ndepend on the type of organism this process occurs within.

Its purpose is to break \ndown the large glucose molecules (containing six carbons) into two smaller molecules called pyruvate, or pyruvic acid (containing three carbons), so they can be transported to the mitochondria.

The higher the cell\u2019s rate of respiration, the more heat is produced.

Similarly, on a cold day you may shiver. This is your muscles rapidly contracting and when they do this, the mitochondria are stimulated to increase their rate of cellular respiration, thus producing heat.The overall process of this catabolic chemical reaction can be written as a word equation:\nglucose     +     oxygen          carbon dioxide     +     water     +     energy\nor as a chemical equation:\nC6H12O6     +     6O2          6CO2     +     6H2O     +     36 or 38 ATP\nThe entire story of aerobic cellular respiration can be represented in a diagram, as shown \nin Figure 5C\u20137.

The uptake of oxygen can be measured, and thus the rate of aerobic cellular respiration can be determined. A respirometer is the tool used to do this, as it measures the rate of exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.\n \u2022A respirometer (Figure 5D\u20131) consists of two sealed containers: one containing \nthe living organism (for example, insects, woodlice or germinating peas) and one containing glass beads with the same mass (acting as a control).\n \u2022As the organism respires, carbon dioxide is produced. Sodium hydroxide is placed in the containers to absorb the carbon dioxide.\n \u2022Oxygen consumption is measured as a change in pressure within the system.

This is because cellular respiration is a complex biochemical pathway consisting of many reactions, all regulated by specific enzymes.\n \u2022The rate of cellular respiration increases as temperature increases, but only up to the optimum. Beyond this point, the enzymes become denatured, their active site changes shape and they are unable to bind to the substrate. Consequently, the process of cellular respiration slows down.\n \u2022At low temperatures, the rate of cellular respiration decreases as the kinetic energy of the molecules involved decreases and there are fewer successful collisions between reactants (substrates) and enzyme active sites.LINK4A THE ROLE \nOF ENZYMES\nAs temperature\nincreases, the rate\n of cellular respiration\nincreases.Optimum\ntemperatureAbove the optimum\ntemperature, the\nrate of cellular\nrespiration\ndecreases quickly.Rate of cellular respiration (arbitrary units)\nTemperature (arbitrary units)\nFigure 5D\u20132 The effect of temperature on the rate of cellular respirationPPSVIDEO 5D\u20131 FACTORS AFFECTING THE RATE OF CELLULAR RESPIRATION\n199 5D FACTORS  AFFECT ING THE RATE  OF CELLUL AR RESPIR ATION\n",

If glucose stores become low, the body draws on alternative sources. For example, pyruvate, lactic acid and lipids may be recycled to make the glucose required for cellular respiration.\nAs with other reactions, the maximum rate of reaction will depend on the number or concentration of enzymes and coenzymes available to assist this biochemical pathway.LINK5B FACTORS \nAFFECTING \nTHE RATE OF \nPHOTOSYNTHESIS\nThe rate of cellular respiration\nincreases as the concentrationof glucose increases, but onlywhen glucose concentrationsare at low\u2013medium levels.At very high glucose\nconcentrations, the rate\nof cellular respiration plateaus.\nNo cellular\nrespiration at very\nlow glucose\nconcentrationsRate of cellular respiration (arbitrary units)\nGlucose concentration (arbitrary units)\nFigure 5D\u20133 The effect of glucose concentration on the rate of cellular \nrespiration\nOxygen concentration\nAs you know, oxygen is an input of the electron transport chain, which is the third stage \nof aerobic cellular respiration.

Also recall that when oxygen is low, cells stop aerobic cellular respiration and begin another biochemical pathway that doesn\u2019t rely on oxygen to proceed: anaerobic cellular respiration, or fermentation. Consequently, less ATP will be produced per glucose molecule (2 ATP) than when aerobic cellular respiration was occurring (36 or 38 ATP).

Carbon dioxide is released naturally through processes like cellular respiration, but human activities, such as deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels, have been the main producers of the gas. For decades, efforts have been made to monitor and lower these emissions.\nGovernments and industries are trying to improve the efficiency of photosynthesis, which \nis the way carbon dioxide is naturally removed from the atmosphere by carbon fixation. The benefits of this improvement will be twofold. The world\u2019s population is growing rapidly and greater amounts of food will be needed to support future generations. Not only will there be less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but it is thought that increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis will mean more nutrient-rich crops and increased crop yields.

When a virus tries \nto take over a cell, its goal is to use the cell to replicate by inserting its genetic material. Scientists have found that certain bacteria have evolved a way to fight back \u2013 they use DNA-cutting proteins, for example \nCas9 , to chop up any viral genetic information floating \naround in their cell. The outcome is that the invading virus can no longer infect, replicate and damage the bacterial cell, or go on to infect other cells.\nScientists can now use the CRISPR-Cas9 system, believed to be the cheapest, fastest and \neasiest form of genetic engineering, to edit genes. \nGene editing  involves the insertion, \nremoval or replacement of DNA within the genome of a living cell.

You also know from Section 5B that most crops on Earth (C3 plants) have \nevolved an energy-wasting process called photorespiration that drastically reduces their growth and yield potential. Recall that it is Rubisco, the plants\u2019 most abundant protein, that binds to oxygen instead of carbon dioxide, meaning that glucose isn\u2019t made by plants around 25% of the time.\nBy 2050, it is estimated that food production will need to double in order to meet the \ndemands of the world\u2019s growing population. Global warming will also have an impact on food production, undoubtedly a negative one. Clearing more land to grow more crops is not an option, as this would worsen global warming. Researchers have suggested that photosynthesis needs to be engineered to make it more efficient. Specifically, we need to engineer crops that can bypass photorespiration so that photosynthetic efficiency will improve. Crops would therefore be at least 25% more productive.\nSelective plant breeding over hundreds of years has already increased crop yields, but such \nan approach involves a lot of work and can take decades to develop improved varieties.\nMore recently, as you learned in Chapter 3C, scientists have been transplanting genes from \none organism into another, producing GM (genetically modified) crops with increased yield.\nNow scientists are looking to use genome editing, like the CRISPR-Cas9 system, as its \noutcome is much the same as selective breeding: there is no introduction of foreign DNA into a plant (unless a gene is being inserted from another species), and the process is faster, cheaper, more precise and relatively easy for those with the appropriate training.LINK5B FACTORS \nAFFECTING \nTHE RATE OF \nPHOTOSYNTHESIS\nLINK9B EVOLVING AND \nNON-EVOLVING \nPOPULATIONS\nLINK3C GENETICALLY \nMODIFIED AND \nTRANSGENIC \nORGANISMS\n3D THE FUTURE \nOF GENOME \nEDITINGLINK\nStudy the crop\ngenomeGene editing Improved crop plant Crop plant\nchromosome chromosome T\nGTT\nC\nGTA\nG\nTATGGCC\nA\nTCAGTTCGACTAACGCCATG\n2 1\nFigure 5E\u20133 Scientists hope that by understanding the role of the different genes in a genome, they can  \ndisable the genes that reduce the efficiency of photosynthesis, thus increasing the amount of glucose produced by the plant.PPSVIDEO 5E\u20131 \nBIOTECHNOLOGICAL \nAPPLICATIONS \nOF BIOCHEMICAL \nPATHWAYS:  \nCRISPR-CAS9\n206\nCHAPTER 5 BIOCHEMICAL PATHWAYS: PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND CELLULAR RESPIRATION\n",

CRISPR-mediated gene regulation can do this.\n \u2022CRISPR technology can manipulate multiple genes simultaneously. This is important as, for example, to increase Rubisco content in maize, three genes must be edited at the same time.\n \u2022One suggested approach to increasing photosynthetic efficiency in C3 crops, such as rice, \nis to convert them to C4 plants.\nEssentially, three steps are necessary for any research in this field. 1\n Understand the entire photosynthetic process including the regulation and diversity of other pathways related to photosynthesis (photorespiration, CAM pathways, C\n4 \npathways and so on), and gain a specific understanding of the genomes of the target crops, so that each gene\u2019s role in growth and yield is clear.\n2\n Use high-performance computing to model the photosynthetic pathway and identify bottlenecks, like photosynthetic inefficiency due to photorespiration.\n3\n Utilise CRISPR-Cas9 to target and edit the identified bottlenecks. \nCheck-in questions \u2013 Set 1\n1  Define the following key terms: CRISPR, Cas9, gene editing.\n2  State the advantages of gene editing over genetic engineering.\n3  Explain how CRISPR-Cas9 can be applied to improve photosynthetic efficiency and therefore crop yield.\nFigure 5E\u20134 Arabidopsis thaliana is believed to be \na useful model plant when screening approaches \nto improve photosynthesis and crop yield using CRISPR-Cas9 systems.\nLINK9B EVOLVING AND \nNON-EVOLVING POPULATIONS\n207 5E BIOTECH NOLOGICAL  APPLIC ATIONS  OF BIOCHE MICAL  PATHWAYS\n",
  "Page 220": "Anaerobic fermentation\nThe need for biofuels\nHumans use enormous amounts of energy all day, every day \u2013 to heat homes, keep lights on, \ndrive cars and so on. Currently we use fossil fuels, like coal, oil and natural gas (for example, petroleum), which are non-renewable energy sources as they take several million years to form. This, and concerns about global warming, have led scientists to search for alternative sources of energy and more efficient and sustainable ways to produce energy.\nIn Section 5C, you learned about the process of fermentation, or anaerobic cellular \nrespiration. Recall that fermentation is a metabolic process in which glucose is converted into lactic acid in animals, or ethanol and carbon dioxide in plants. Scientists have spent a lot of time investigating the process of alcoholic fermentation, as ethanol can be used as a \nbiofuel . The term \u2018biofuel\u2019 comes from the fact that it is a (usually liquid) fuel \nproduced from organic material, called biomass . Biomass includes plant material, animal \nby-products, microbes and waste material. It is produced by many different industries, including agriculture, fisheries, food manufacturing, forestry and even municipal waste.\nIf biofuels are created from biomass by biological processes like fermentation, then that \nmeans they are renewable (assuming there is a constant supply of reactants) and carbon neutral. That is, biofuels release no net amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The carbon dioxide that is released during the combustion of the biofuels was originally absorbed from the atmosphere during photosynthesis.LINK5C CELLULAR \nRESPIRATION\nBiofuel \nfuel produced from biomass; usually liquid\nBiomass \norganic material, including plant material, animal by-products, microbes and waste material; produced by many different industries\n \nCO2 released back into\natmosphere\nCombustion of biofuel\nin engines produces\nwater vapour and\ncarbon dioxide\nLiquid biofuel distributed \nfor use in transport and \nother industries\nBiomass converted into biofuel via fermentationCrop harvested to\nproduce biomassCrop absorbs CO 2\nthrough photosynthesis\nBIOFUEL\nFigure 5E\u20135 Carbon-neutral cycle: biofuels are carbon neutral, as the carbon dioxide \nreleased during their combustion was originally absorbed by plants during photosynthesis.Second-\ngeneration biofuel a biofuel produced from non-edible feedstocks, e.g. cellulose and other fibrous plant materials derived from crop residues, straw and municipal waste\nApplication: producing biofuels from biomass\nBiofuels are categorised by the type of feedstock (raw material) that is used to create them.\n \u2022First-generation biofuels : produced directly from food such as corn and sugar cane.\n \u2022Second-generation biofuels : produced from cellulose-based non-food crops not suitable \nfor human consumption. An example is lignocellulose biomass such as leftovers from a \ncorn harvest (called corn stover), straw, wastepaper and other municipal waste. These feedstocks require several processing steps before they can undergo fermentation.First-generation \nbiofuel a biofuel produced from edible feedstocks, e.g. starch and glucose from plants like corn and sugar cane\nPPS\n208\nCHAPTER 5 BIOCHEMICAL PATHWAYS: PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND CELLULAR RESPIRATION\n",

However, its production is not as simple as just fermenting sugars. The basic steps for the production of bioethanol are outlined below.1 \n Pre-treatment: used to help break down the biomass to increase its surface area and therefore its accessibility by enzymes. Pre-treatment options include:\n \u25a0biological approaches \u2013 enzymes\n \u25a0chemical approaches \u2013 liquefaction, acids and alkalis\n \u25a0physical approaches \u2013 milling, mashing and grinding\n \u25a0physiochemical approaches \u2013 cooking/heating and steam.\n2  Enzymatic hydrolysis: hydrolysis is the opposite of a condensation reaction (recall this term from Section 2C). This means water is used to help enzymes (including amylase and cellulase) break the glycosidic linkages between glucose molecules in the polysaccharides starch and cellulose (including hemicellulose and lignocellulose).\n3 \n Fermentation: the anaerobic cellular respiration of glucose using a microorganism that is selected based on its efficiency at ethanol production. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is most commonly used, and the bacterium Zymomonas mobilis\n is an \nalternative, due to its greater sugar uptake, higher yields and greater resistance to high ethanol concentrations.\n4 \n Distillation and purification: water is removed from the ethanol so that it is in a useable form. Following distillation, purification further removes water using desiccants and dehydration techniques, and filtering with a molecular sieve.LINK4A THE ROLE \nOF ENZYMES\nLINK 2C PROTEINSPPSVIDEO 5E\u20132 BIOTECHNO- LOGICAL APPLICATIONS OF BIOCHEMICAL PATHWAYS:  BIOFUEL PRODUCTION\nLINK5C CELLULAR RESPIRATION\n209 5E BIOTECH NOLOGICAL  APPLIC ATIONS  OF BIOCHE MICAL  PATHWAYS\n",
  "Page 222": " Most bioethanol is made in this way primarily from corn or maize grain, but scientists \nare continuing to develop the pre-treatment technologies that will allow more efficient use of cellulose, the non-edible fibrous material that constitutes the bulk of plant matter. By using non-edible materials, industries will not need to use food crops to make biofuel, and therefore food crops could be used to support our increasing global population. The question of whether to allocate land for growing crops for food or for fuel production is known as the \u2018food versus fuel debate\u2019.\nConditions\n As with any biochemical process, there are factors that can affect the efficiency of the pathway. In the production of bioethanol, certain conditions need to be met if the process is to be successful.\n \u2022Temperature: you learned in Section 4B about how temperature affects enzyme activity. Recall that, if the temperature is too low, the activity of enzymes decreases, and the reaction slows down. As the temperature increases to the optimum, so does the kinetic energy of the enzymes, causing more successful collisions between the enzyme active site and the substrate. However, when the temperature is too high, the enzyme denatures and the active site can no longer bind to the substrate, so the rea\nction no longer occurs.\n \u2022Substrate: as you know, every reaction needs an ample supply of its reactants, or substrate, if it is to proceed. In the case of biofuel production, there needs to be a high glucose concentration so that the enzymes involved can work most efficiently. If too little substrate is available, the rate of the reaction will decrease.\n \u2022Absence of oxygen: as you learned in Section 5D, fermentation is a biochemical pathway that occurs in the absence of oxygen. Therefore, oxygen must be excluded from the vessel in which fermentation is being carried out.\n \u2022Yeast: without yeast, the fermentation of the glucose solution to ethanol cannot occur. Yeast contains the enzyme \u2018zymase\u2019, which acts as a catalyst for the reaction.\nCheck-in questions \u2013 Set 2\n1  Define the two key terms: biofuel, biomass.\n2  Write the word equation for anaerobic cellular respiration resulting in alcohol production.\n3  Explain the role of anaerobic cellular respiration in producing the biofuel ethanol.LINK4B FACTORS \nIMPACTING \nON ENZYME \nFUNCTION\nLINK5D FACTORS \nAFFECTING \nTHE RATE OF \nCELLULAR \nRESPIRATION\nWORKSHEET \n5E\u20131 \nBIOTECHNO-  \nLOGICAL \nAPPLICATIONS \nOF BIOCHEMICAL \nPATHWAYSDOCFigure 5E\u20137 Producing bioethanol from biomass using fermentation is a \ncomplex process.\nPre-treatment\nFermentationDistillation and\npuri\ufb01cation Enzymatic\nhydrolysis \nPPS\n210\nCHAPTER 5 BIOCHEMICAL PATHWAYS: PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND CELLULAR RESPIRATION\n",

Developing crops that are more resistant to disease can assist this greater production of unspoiled food. In Australia, cotton crops are typically predated on by the Helicoverpa armigera caterpillar, which chews the flower buds. These buds develop into cotton fruit, which contain the seeds that cotton fibre grows from. Historically, control of the caterpillar was maintained by spraying pesticides. However, now approximately 90% of the crop is genetically modified to resist the caterpillar.\n This genetically modified cotton plant, called \u2018Bt cotton\u2019, produces a protein that is poisonous to the caterpillar but harmless to other insects and humans. The genetic information for making the protein is obtained from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (hence the name \u2018Bt\u2019) and transferred to a plasmid, which is then inserted into a different bacterium, Agrobacterium tumefaciens.

Key examples of each class of pathogen are investigated, including bacteria and fungi (cellular), and viruses (non-cellular). The various modes of transmission used by these pathogens to gain entry into a host and bring about the onset of disease within the infected organism are also discussed.\nThe fundamental principle your immune system relies upon to protect you is its ability to \nrecognise self from non-self. You will learn how unique surface molecules, known as antigens, can be classified as either self-antigens or non-self antigens, and how the detection of non-self antigens present on invading pathogens leads to the initiation of an immune response.

The earliest recorded pandemic occurred in Ancient Greece in 430 BC. This was the time of a great war between the Athenians and the Spartans. The disease, now suspected to be typhoid fever, caused fever, skin lesions and a bloody throat. The disease wiped out two-thirds of the population, significantly weakened the Athenians and is thought to be the reason that Athens fell to the Spartans.\nBetween 1347 and 1351, the Black Death wreaked havoc throughout Europe. Thought \nto be the result of a bacterial infection known as the bubonic plague, it would turn the skin black in patches. It killed 25 million Europeans and 75 million people worldwide, effectively wiping out 50% of the world\u2019s population. Bodies littered the streets and rotted on the ground, filling cities with the constant stench of death.\nFigure 6A\u20131 Black patches of skin was a \ncommon symptom of bubonic plague, and the disease still appears today, such as this case in the USA.\nFigure 6A\u20132 A mask worn by a plague doctor.

  "Page 242": "EXPLAIN\nThe nature of disease\nInformation collected by the World Health Organization (WHO) over a number of years \nshows that nine of the top 10 causes of death worldwide relate to a variety of diseases (see Figure 6A\u20134). For the past 15 years, the top two causes of death around the world have been heart disease and stroke. But what exactly is a disease? \nDisease  refers to any condition \nthat affects the normal function of either a part of an organism or the complete organism. Diseases can be classified into two broad categories.\n \u2022Non-infectious (non-communicable) diseases  are not contagious and therefore cannot \nbe directly transmitted from one organism to another. Common examples of non-infectious diseases include cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer\u2019s and diabetes.\n \u2022Infectious (communicable) diseases  are contagious, which means they can be transmitted \nfrom one organism to another. Common examples of infectious diseases include influenza, the common cold and chickenpox.\nNon-infectious diseases result from genetics, poor lifestyle choices (diet, exercise) or physical/mental degeneration. Infectious diseases are caused by \npathogens .Pathogen \na disease-causing agentIn 1918 the deadliest natural disaster \nin human history began its rampage. Between March 1918 and June 1920, an influenza pandemic known as the Spanish flu killed approximately 100\u00a0million people around the world. The pandemic occurred at the time of World War I and was given its name as a result of Spain being a neutral country during the war and accurately reporting its death rate. Germany, the United States, Britain and France were heavily engaged in combat and saw it as a sign of weakness to announce their death toll. In the end, influenza may have tipped the balance of power in the Allies\u2019 favour, as the mortality rate was higher in Germany and Austria than in Britain and France. Modern transport made it easy for troops to spread the disease, and malnourishment and stress as a result of war would have increased the lethality of the virus in soldiers.\nIn more recent times, an outbreak of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2003 \ninfected more than 8000 people in 26 countries and resulted in the deaths of 774 people. Lessons learnt from this outbreak led to many improvements in disease control practices and, as a result, diseases like influenza (swine and avian), Ebola and Zika have been brought under control, preventing further pandemics. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for COVID-19, which spread to 114 countries in just three months. By the end of 2020 it had infected over 50 million people worldwide and caused more than a million deaths. A pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization in March 2020, with the outbreak showing that, despite all the technology we have available, we are still vulnerable to the devastating effects of disease outbreaks. As history can attest, the capacity of diseases to cripple our way of life should not be underestimated.\nFigure 6A\u20133 Victims of the Spanish flu being \ntransported by nursesLINK8A EMERGENCE, \nRE-EMERGENCE \nAND DISEASE \nCONTAINMENT\nNon-infectious \n(non-communicable) disease a disease that cannot be transmitted from one organism to another\nInfectious \n(communicable) disease a disease that  \ncan be transmitted from one organism to anotherDisease any condition that affects the normal function of either a part\u00a0of an organism or the complete organismLINK8A EMERGENCE, \nRE-EMERGENCE \nAND DISEASE \nCONTAINMENT\n230\nCHAPTER 6 FOREIGN INVADERS: SELF VERSUS NON-SELF\n",

Direct contact allows the pathogen to easily transfer between organisms, where it can continue to exert its effects, resulting in the onset of disease. Modes of transmission by common pathogens are outlined in Table 6A\u20131. Note that, in many instances, pathogens are capable of gaining entry to a host through more than one transmission mode.

Known as the Great Plague, it killed approximately 100\n 000 people, which was 20% of London\u2019s \npopulation at the time. It wasn\u2019t until the Great Fire of London in 1666, which burnt most of London to the ground, that the plague\u2019s death toll began to decrease, as it is thought that the fires killed the diseased rats carrying infected fleas. These infected fleas are an example of a \nvector , which is another mode of transmission by which pathogens can spread disease.\n232\nCHAPTER 6 FOREIGN INVADERS: SELF VERSUS NON-SELF\n",

The vectors themselves are usually not affected by the pathogen. This is in contrast to a carrier, who is infected by the pathogen and in most instances (unless asymptomatic) displays symptoms associated with the disease.\nEach year, vector-borne diseases are responsible for 17% \nof all infectious disease and cause more than 700\n 000 \ndeaths.

A general representation of the course of disease is shown in Figure 6A\u20139.\nUpon infection by a pathogen, the \nprogression of disease within a host has three stages:1 \n Incubation: Initially there will likely be an incubation period, for various reasons. The pathogen may take time to multiply to a number sufficient to cause disease; it may take time to reach target tissue that is susceptible to its actions; or toxins released by the pathogen may take time to accumulate, before they cause disease.\n2 \n Symptoms of disease: Symptoms result from the body\u2019s immune system trying to eliminate the infection, or they are the effect that the pathogen has on the body of the host (for example, runny nose, rash, coughing, sneezing). All diseases usually have characteristic symptoms that assist a doctor to make a correct diagnosis.\n3 \n Recovery: The final stage in the course of disease is recovery. Usually the host\u2019s immune system will fight off the pathogen, either naturally or with the assistance of \nprescribed medication. If the pathogen cannot be eliminated, then disability or death is likely. Factors such as the infected person\u2019s age and state of health are important in determining whether the person makes a full recovery.\nCheck-in questions \u2013 Set 1\n1  Compare the main features of infectious and non-infectious diseases.\n2  Distinguish between a pathogen and a disease.\n3  How do vector-borne diseases differ from diseases caused by direct contact or medium-transmitted diseases?\nDetermining self from non-self\nYour body\u2019s ability to defend against pathogen invasion depends on the ability of your immune system to recognise what belongs to your body and what is foreign. In other words, your immune system must be able to identify \u2018self\u2019 from \u2018non-self\u2019.\nThe cells of all organisms have unique molecules on their surface that distinguish them \nfrom the cells of other organisms. These unique molecules or markers are referred to as \nantigens  and can be recognised by an organism\u2019s immune system as \u2018self\u2019 or \u2018non-self\u2019.\nAntigens\nAntigens are most commonly made of protein and/or polysaccharides. They can be classified into two distinct groups, depending on their source of origin.\nSelf-antigens\n \u2022Originate from inside the body and are found on the surface of cells that make up the organism.\n \u2022The immune system recognises any object with these antigens as belonging to \u2018self\u2019 and no immune response is initiated.LINK7D THIRD LINE \nOF DEFENCEInfectionRecoverySeverity of symptoms\nTimeIncubation\nperiodSymptoms\nof disease\nFigure 6A\u20139 The general course of disease\nAntigen \na unique marker on the surface of cells or viruses that is used in the identification of self from non-self\nSelf-antigen an antigen on the surface of cells of an organism that is identified by the immune system as belonging to the organism and therefore does not trigger an immune responseDOCWORKSHEET  \n6A\u20131  \nIDENTIFYING SELF \nFROM NON-SELF\n234\nCHAPTER 6 FOREIGN INVADERS: SELF VERSUS NON-SELF\n",

A mosquito vector spreads the worms from person to person through its bite. When an infected mosquito bites an individual, the worms pass from the mosquito into the new host, where they make their way to the lymphatic system and become lodged in the lymph nodes. This results in blockages and prevents the proper circulation of lymph fluid. As lymph fluid builds up, swelling of the legs, arms and genitals occurs. The condition is not fatal.\nThe main concern is that elephantiasis reduces the effectiveness of the immune \nsystem, making the sufferer susceptible to dangerous secondary infections. Prevention of disease is always preferable to treatment. Educating \u2018at-risk\u2019 communities to stop the transfer of disease through the use of mosquito nets and insect repellents is key to eliminating the disease.\n  \nFigure 6B\u20131 Left: Elephantiasis symptoms caused by the parasitic worm Wuchereria bancrofti, \nwhich clogs the lymphatic system of the host, causing extreme swelling of body parts.

For example, our digestive system contains thousands of useful bacteria that not only assist in the breakdown of substances in food that are difficult to digest, but also occupy space within our bodies, making colonisation by harmful bacteria more difficult.

Some \nproduce toxins that build up and disrupt the normal functioning of cells, while others damage host cells directly, and some interfere with immune system cells that are working to defend the host. Most also produce and release enzymes that break down the connective tissues of the host, allowing the infection to spread faster.\nAs with all pathogens, bacteria must gain entry into the host to bring about the symptoms \nof disease. Bacteria use a variety of transmission methods to infect the host. Once inside the host\u2019s body, they are capable of dividing rapidly (once every 20 minutes) and can quickly compromise the health of the infected individual.\nTable 6B\u20132 lists just a few examples of the many diseases caused by bacterial pathogens. \nTwo case studies, one following Table 6B\u20132 and one in the interactive textbook, provide a more detailed insight into the mechanisms that bacteria can use to bring about the onset of the disease they are associated with.LINK7A FIRST LINE \nOF DEFENCE\nDOCWORKSHEET  \n6B\u20131 CELLULAR \nPATHOGENS:  \nA CASE STUDY\n242\nCHAPTER 6 FOREIGN INVADERS: SELF VERSUS NON-SELF\n",

These spores are heat resistant and able to survive in the environment for as long as 40 years. When the spores enter a deep skin wound, they grow into bacteria that produce a strong toxin called tetanospasmin, which disables the motor neurons that control muscles. As the bacteria divide, more toxin is produced, leading to muscle stiffness (particularly in the jaw and neck) and painful body spasms, the major symptom of the disease.

Common symptoms of infection are characteristic lesions or spots that appear on the diseased areas of the plant. The fungal spores undergo a series of developmental stages that enable them to break through the plant cell walls. From there, invasive hyphae develop and spread throughout the host cells, ultimately resulting in complete infection of the plant and total crop failure.\nEffective fungicide protectants have been difficult to develop because of the multi-\ncycle developmental stages of the fungus. Cost and damage to ecosystems have also made protective measures against rice blast disease challenging.

It infects over 200 million people annually (particularly young children) and results in approximately 400\n 000 deaths every year, with most cases \noccurring in Africa; however, more than 40% of the global population are at risk.\nFive species of Plasmodium are responsible for malaria in humans, but two of these species \u2013 P. vivax and P. falciparum\n \u2013 pose a greater threat. Once bitten by an infected \nmosquito, sufferers will experience symptoms within 10\u201315 days. Early symptoms include fever, headache and chills. More severe symptoms include seizures, coma, anaemia, jaundice and enlargement of the liver and spleen. Severe symptoms require immediate medical attention; if left untreated, death will occur in a matter of days.\nMalaria life cycle\nThe Plasmodium species responsible for malarial infection operate across two hosts according to their life cycle stage. Part of the life cycle occurs in the female Anopheles mosquito, with the remainder occurring in a human host. This cyclic nature of infection is outlined below. The stages are illustrated in Figure 6B\u201314.\nMosquito stage:\n1 \n When a female Anopheles mosquito is ready to develop eggs, she seeks a blood meal.\n2  When she feeds on an infected source, Plasmodium gametocytes (pre-gametes) are ingested.\n3 \n The gametocytes fuse in the mosquito\u2019s gut.\n4  After 10\u201318 days, a new form of the parasite, known as a sporozoite, moves to the \nmosquito\u2019s salivary glands.\n5  When the Anopheles mosquito feeds again, the sporozoites move into the new host (human), where they travel to the liver and begin the next phase of the cycle.\nHuman liver stage:6 \n Sporozoites infect liver cells and mature into the next developmental stage, known \nas schizonts.\n7  The schizonts rupture and release merozoites, which infect red blood cells.Pathogen: PlasmodiumMode of transmission: Bites of Anopheles mosquitoes (vector)\n \n  \nFigure 6B\u201313 Left: Infected female Anopheles mosquitoes transfer the Plasmodium parasite to the host.

It wasn\u2019t until the 1980s that the disease became commonly reported by the media. In the 1980s and 1990s, the disease was reported as a condition that affected mostly homosexual men or drug addicts. Transmission of HIV was not well understood, and misleading information created a damaging stigma associated with these communities.\nHIV is transmitted through direct \ncontact with infected bodily fluids (for example, blood, sperm, breast milk). Upon infection, the virus is almost entirely killed off by the host\u2019s immune system, but a small number of viral particles remain and replicate over time. If untreated, the virus gradually (over many years) destroys the person\u2019s immune cells, making them vulnerable to opportunistic infections and cancers \u2013 this stage of the disease is known as AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). These opportunistic infections would not cause illness in a person with a healthy immune system, but in someone who has HIV that has progressed to AIDS, they are lethal, and can cause death within months.\nFigure 6C\u20131 US professional basketball player, \nMagic Johnson\n257 6C NON-CELLULA R PATHOGENS\n",
  "Page 270": "EXPLAIN\nNon-cellular pathogens\nIn Section 6B, you read about the classification of cellular pathogens as living organisms \nthat are made up of at least one type of cell. Recall that all cellular pathogens have four key characteristics: genetic material, cytosol, ribosomes and a plasma membrane (Table 6B\u20131). In this section, you will explore a different class of pathogen. \nNon-cellular pathogens  are \ndisease-causing agents that lack the cellular structures necessary for independent replication. Unlike their cellular counterparts, non-cellular pathogens are considered to be non-living. They do not possess ribosomes or a cytosol and, in order to cause disease, must gain entry into a host so they can replicate using the host cell\u2019s machinery. The onset of symptoms within the host depends on the pathogen\u2019s ability to increase its numbers within the host.\nAs you will see throughout this section, non-cellular pathogens have evolved to become \nvery effective at exploiting host cells and causing disease. In fact, diseases associated with non-cellular pathogens have some of the highest mortality rates of all infectious disease.\nViruses\nViruses  are non-cellular infectious agents that cause disease by forcing host cells to produce \nthousands of identical copies of the virus, which infect new host cells, disrupting normal cellular function. Viruses are often referred to as obligate, because they cannot survive for long outside a host cell and are therefore obligated to infect new cells as a means of survival.By the end of the 1990s, the World Health Organization reported that AIDS was the fourth-largest cause of death worldwide and the number one killer in Africa. Approximately 33 million people were living with HIV, and around 14 million people had died of AIDS-related complications since the first reporting of the disease in 1981.\nToday, approximately 38 million people around the world are thought to be infected \nwith HIV. The key to living with the virus is to stop it from developing into AIDS. Thankfully, advances in technology have enabled scientists to develop drugs that effectively prevent the progression of HIV into AIDS.

The capsid provides protection for the genome and, in many cases, houses enzymes that assist the virus to enter its target host cell.\nViral envelope\nSome viruses contain an external layer known as the envelope. The envelope is a lipid membrane that surrounds the capsid, encasing it and the viral genome inside. Unlike the capsid, the instructions for making the envelope do not come from within the viral genome. Instead, the virus \u2018borrows\u2019 a section of the host cell\u2019s membrane as it exits the cell.\nAs you may have noticed in the previous images in this section, many viruses contain \nproteins that are embedded in the viral envelope.

The emergence of new viral diseases and the re-emergence of old ones mean that scientists are constantly learning about the pathogenic capacity of viruses.\nRecall from Section 6A the many modes of transmission used by pathogens to gain entry \ninto their host. Viruses are highly effective at breaching initial host defences and, once inside, generally result in disease through one (or more) of the following mechanisms:\n \u2022cell lysis, by invading and destroying cells \u2013 when enough cells die, the organism will suffer as a result\n \u2022initiation of an immune response \u2013 this will bring on symptoms such as fever, inflammation and fatigue\n \u2022the onset of cancer \u2013 through direct manipulation of host cell DNA\n \u2022disabling of the host\u2019s immune system \u2013 through the destruction of white blood cells.\nWhile some viruses can cause lifelong, chronic infections (for example, hepatitis viruses), others can exist harmlessly within the organism.

These are shown in Figures 6C\u20137 and 6C\u20138.\nFigure 6C\u20137 The life cycle of a coronavirus. Coronaviruses cause the common cold, \ngastroenteritis, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and COVID-19. The virus (with red spikes) reproduces inside a host cell (green). It binds to the cell surface with its protein spikes (1) before entering the cell (2) and releasing its RNA (ribonucleic acid) genetic material (yellow strands, 3). This is copied by the cell's own genetic machinery (4). The new viral genetic material produces its own surface and spike proteins (5) in the host cell's ribosomes, and eventually new virions burst from the cell (6). 6\n12\n345\n263 6C NON-CELLUL AR PATHOGENS\nISBN 978-1-108-89462-3 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be tran ferr d t  an ther party.\n",

Attachment\nOccurs when specific viral proteins on the viral \ncapsid or envelope detect and bind to specific receptor proteins on the membrane of the target host cell. The diagram shows how this happens in the case of a virus with an envelope.\nThe specific nature of the interaction between \nviral proteins and host cell membrane receptors determines the type of host cell a virus can infect.\nAttachment must occur before the virus can enter  \nthe host cell.\n2. Entry\nUpon attachment, the virus breaches the  \nplasma membrane. There are three methods  of entry.\n2.1 Membrane fusion\nViruses that possess a viral envelope use a secondary protein to puncture the host cell membrane. This allows the viral envelope to fuse with the the cell\u2019s plasma membrane, giving the capsid entry to the cell. The capsid breaks down by enzyme action, releasing the viral genome.\n2.2 Endocytosis\nViruses without a viral envelope enter the host cell by endocytosis, inside a vesicle. Once inside the host cell, the virus exits the vesicle and gains access to the cytoplasm. The capsid breaks down by enzyme action and releases the virus\u2019s viral genome.\n2.3 Genetic injection\nUpon attachment, some viruses simply inject the viral  genome into the cytoplasm of the cell and leave the  rest of the viral structure on the external surface of  the host cell.\nEnvelope\nCapsid\nViral\nproteinsViral genetic\nmaterial\nPlasma\nmembraneTarget cellSpeci\ufb01c\nmembrane receptor\nViral genomeCapsid\nGenetic material\nVesicle\nAttachmentInjection\nGenetic\nmaterial\nFigure 6C\u20138 Viral life cyclePPS\n264\nCHAPTER 6 FOREIGN INVADERS: SELF VERSUS NON-SELF\nISBN 978-1-108-89462-3 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be tran ferr d t  an ther party.\n",
  "Page 277": "Methods of viral replication, assembly and release\n3. Replication\nThe host cell machinery is taken over for viral genome replication and protein expression.\nThis stage differs depending on the type of nucleic acid that makes up the viral genome.\n\u2022 DNA genome\n  Genome replication occurs primarily in the host cell\u2019s nucleus. The cell\u2019s normal transcription process is used to encode the viral genome into mRNA that will be translated into viral proteins using the cell\u2019s own ribosomes and amino acids.\n\u2022 RNA genome\n  Replication of the genome occurs predominantly in the cytoplasm of the host cell. Translation of viral RNA occurs on the host cell\u2019s ribosomes, resulting in production of viral proteins.\n4. Assembly\nNewly synthesised viral particles are assembled from the replicated genome and viral proteins.\nSome of these viral proteins come together to \nbuild the complete capsid that usually forms around a newly replicated viral genome.\nOther viral proteins embed into the envelope that forms as the \nvirus leaves the host cell.\n5. Release\nNewly assembled viral particles exit the host cell in one of three ways, and when they meet a new host cell they commence the life cycle once again for further infection.\n5.1 Cell lysis\nThe hostcell bursts, releasing all the newly created virusparticles.\n5.2 Budding\nThe virus pushes its way through the plasma membrane of the cell. This is how enveloped viruses acquire their lipid envelope \u2013 from the plasma membrane of the host cell.\n5.3 Exocytosis\nViruses inside the host cell are packaged into a vesicle and transported to the plasma membrane, where they are released into the extracellular space. Here they are free to infect new host cells.Viral genome replication\nViral DNA transcription to mRNAmRNA translation\nto viral proteinViral genome\n(DNA)\nNucleusRibosomeHost cell\nViral RNA transcription to mRNA\nmRNA translation to viral proteinCopies ofviral genomeViral genome\n(RNA)\nRibosomeHost cell\nRuptured cellmembraneVirus particlesCell lysis\nHost cell plasma membrane\nbecomes viral envelopeBudding\nVesicleRelease of newly\nsynthesised virus\nFigure 6C\u20138 ContinuedPPS\n265 6C NON-CELLUL AR PATHOGENS\nISBN 978-1-108-89462-3 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be tran ferr d t  an ther party.\n",

Flu-related complications can happen at any age, but young children, the elderly and anyone with pre-existing health ailments are more susceptible to these complications.\nInfluenza virus structure  \nand life cycle\nThe influenza virus consists of \na viral envelope surrounding a capsid that encloses an RNA genome. In most cases the genome consists of segments of single-stranded RNA.\nEmbedded into the viral envelope \nare two major glycoproteins, known as \nhaemagglutinin  (H) \nand neuraminidase\u00a0 (N).

  "Page 279": "The best form of defence against the influenza virus, particularly for those at high \nrisk, is vaccination. Mutations in the viral genome result in different strains of the virus from season to season. As you read earlier, the different strains result in slight differences in the make-up of the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase glycoproteins that are embedded in the viral envelope. For this reason, an influenza vaccination does not give long-lasting protection. Each year the WHO predicts the strains of the influenza virus that are most likely to be prevalent the following year. Vaccinations that offer the best protection against these strains are developed and distributed. The ability of the influenza virus to mutate means that the threat of an influenza pandemic is ever-present.

When the insect feeds on an infected plant, it can then carry the virus and transfer it to a healthy plant during a subsequent feed. As the insect feeds on sap, the virus can be transmitted into the phloem, giving it access to the plant. As plant cells contain a rigid cell wall, the virus will generally move through channels called \nplasmodesmata , \nallowing it to spread through the plant.\nOther methods of transmission include the spread of infected pollen or seed, as well as \nagricultural practices that transfer infected sap of a wounded plant to a healthy one.

They are unique in their ability to cause disease because, unlike other pathogens, they do not contain any form of genetic material.\nThe protein that prions arise from \nexists naturally on the membrane of neurons in healthy humans and animals. In the case of prion disease, these proteins are misfolded, giving rise to a mutant shape. When a misfolded protein comes into contact with the normal form (\nPrPC), it converts it into the \nmutated form ( PrPSc). When enough pathogenic prions are produced, they collect together, \nforming plaques that damage neural tissue, affecting brain function as a consequence. The diseases associated with prions are all variants of a larger group of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE).\nThe pathogenic form of the prion can arise spontaneously through mutation in the gene that \ncodes for the normal prion protein. More commonly, the mutant form is passed on through the consumption of infected food. Mutant prions are resistant to high temperatures (they do not denature), strong enzymes and radiation. A treatment is yet to be found that is effective in destroying the prions without causing harm to the patient.

  "Page 290": "HOW DOES LIFE CHANGE AND RESPOND TO \nCHALLENGES?\nIntroduction\nThe presence of pathogens with non-self antigens presents a problem, and organisms need to be \nable to defend against them \u2013 they need immunity. Immunity has two components: the innate response and the adaptive response. The innate response has two levels of defence, and the adaptive response has a further level. A key difference between the two is that the innate response involves no \u2018memory\u2019 of the pathogen but is rapid, whereas the adaptive response is slower but once it has memory of a pathogen is quick to respond upon subsequent exposure.\nThree lines of defence make up the innate and adaptive responses. The first line of defence includes \nphysical, chemical and microbiota barriers to prevent the pathogen from entering. The second line of defence involves immune cells, complement proteins and signalling molecules. The third line of defence comprises the humoral response and cell-mediated immunity. The inflammatory response supports the second line of defence, while the lymphatic system transports the immune system components and detects the presence of antigens at lymph nodes.\nImmunity can be acquired by active or passive means. Active immunity initiates the third line \nof defence to cause an adaptive response, whereas a passive response acts like the third line of defence, except that the individual does not form any long-term immunity.\nCurriculum\nArea of Study 1 Outcome 1\nResponding to antigens\nStudy Design Learning intentions \u2013 at the end of this chapter I will be able to: \n\u2022 Physical, chemical and microbiota barriers as preventative mechanisms of pathogenic infection in animals and plants7A\n   First line of defence\n7A.1 Recall and define terms to do with the first line of defence\n7A.2  Describe what physical, chemical and microbiota barriers are, and recall that they make up the first line of defence\n7A.3\n  Provide examples of physical and chemical barriers in plants and animals\n7A.4\n  Identify where examples of physical, chemical and microbiota barriers would be on a bodyUNIT \n4 \nIMMUNITY: LINES OF DEFENCECHAPTER  \n7\n278\n",

As a result, plants have \nmainly physical and chemical barriers, and microbiotic barriers to a limited extent, to help protect them (these are explored in the Explain section). These barriers are vital for a plant\u2019s survival, as plants lack the cellular defence mechanisms that animals have in their second and third lines of defence. Therefore, each plant cell effectively has to defend  itself. An example of a bacterial infection that affects plants is crown gall disease (Figure 7A\u20131). Crown gall is caused by the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which enters via damaged roots or stems and causes growths known as galls. The galls prevent the plant from transporting water and nutrients, which causes the plant to become weak and stunted. An example of a viral infection in plants is tobacco mosaic virus (Figure\u00a07A\u20132), which causes a distinct \u2018mosaic\u2019 pattern of discolouration on the leaves. This affects the chlorophyll content of the leaves and reduces the amount of photosynthesis that is able to occur, resulting in stunted growth. An example of a fungal infection in plants is rose black spot (Figure 7A\u20133). You may have seen rose black spot in gardens, where the rose leaves appear yellow with black spots on them. The infected leaves drop early, resulting in less photosynthesis, which causes stunted growth.\nFigure 7A\u20131 Crown gall disease \ncaused by a bacterial infectionFigure 7A\u20132 A grape leaf affected by tobacco mosaic virusFigure 7A\u20133 The distinctive pattern of rose black spot, a fungal disease\n282\nCHAPTER 7 IMMUNITY: LINES OF DEFENCE\n",
  "Page 295": "EXPLAIN\nImmunity structure\nThe immune system has three levels \nof defence against pathogens. You can think of the immune system as being like a series of three babushka dolls. The outer doll is the first line of defence and the first of two innate responses. The second line of defence, represented by the middle babushka doll, is the second innate response (covered in Section 7B) and the smallest babushka doll is the third line of defence, known as the adaptive response (covered in Section 7D).\nFigure 7A\u20134 Three babushka dolls representing \nthe three lines of defence: two innate responses and the adaptive response\nFigure 7A\u20135 Overview of immunity in humans and plants\n2nd line of defence:\nspecialised cells, molecules\nand physiological response\nHumans3rd line of defence:\nhumoral and cell-\nmediated immunityAdaptive responseImmunity\nInnate response\n1st line of defence:\nphysical, chemical and\nmicrobiotic barriers\nPlants\nA key feature of the innate response  is that there is no memory of the pathogen. This means \nthat the first and second lines of defence do not respond any faster on reinfection by the \nsame pathogen. The adaptive response does have memory of a pathogen and results in a larger and faster response.\nKeeping the pathogens out: barriers\nThe first line of defence  is the barrier defence. It is part of the innate response, as the \nbarriers aim to keep all pathogens out, no matter what they are. There are three types of barriers: physical, chemical and microbiota.

The microbiota barrier competes with the pathogen for resources and space, preventing the pathogen from growing and reproducing.\nIt is important to be able to distinguish between the three types of barrier, identify examples \nand explain how each helps prevent a pathogen from entering the internal environment. Note that elements of the first line of defence have both physical and chemical features. For example, intact skin is a physical barrier and it contains cells that help to produce the Figure 7A\u20136 Some of the physical, chemical and microbiota barriers in a human body, to prevent a \npathogen from entering\nIntact skin acts as \na physical barrier, secreting sweat, and has normal floraStomach lining \ncells secrete strong acids to kill pathogensNose hairs and \nmucus help trap pathogensTears contain lysozyme to burst bacteria and continually wash the eye\nTrachea with \ncilia and mucous membrane.

  "Page 297": "chemical barrier of sweat. An important adaptation in both animals and plants is to repair \nor replace the physical barrier when the organism suffers a penetrating injury, especially if blood (in animals) or phloem/xylem fluid (in plants) is being lost, both to prevent water and solute lost and also to prevent pathogens entering via the wound. In vertebrates this is done by blood clotting, which plugs the leak and allows new skin to grow. This is a complex process that interacts with the immune system. In plants, phloem sap may also coagulate to plug the wound, while new epithelial cells grow beneath it.\nBarriers in animals\nPhysical and chemical\nOne of the main barriers for an animal is skin. To be effective as a barrier, preventing \npathogens from entering the internal environment, skin must be intact. A breach in the skin is a site for pathogens to enter the body, where the second line of defence is activated (covered in Section 7B).\nAs well as being a physical barrier, the skin also has chemical barriers such as secretions \nthat lower the pH to help prevent bacteria from growing. Skin also secretes sweat containing salt, which inhibits bacteria.\nTears are another example of a chemical barrier, as they help to wash or flood bacteria out of \nthe eye, as well as containing lysozyme, which causes the bacteria to lyse (rupture). Lungs have surfactants (lipid-protein complexes) on their moist internal surfaces in contact with air to prevent the alveoli (tiny air sacs) collapsing under the surface tension of water. A protein component of surfactants also binds to pathogens, marking them for macrophages to engulf them.\nThe lining of the air-conducting part of the respiratory system, including the nasal cavity, \ntrachea, bronchi and bronchioles, has mucus-secreting cells, along with cilia. If a pathogen enters the airways, the mucus acts as a physical barrier, as it aids in trapping the pathogen, while the cilia (also a physical barrier) assist in directing the mucus with the trapped pathogens towards the mouth to be swallowed. Swallowing the mucus sends the pathogen into the highly acidic environment of the stomach.\nNeurons in the brains of vertebrates are highly vulnerable to pathogens and toxins, and a so-\ncalled \nblood\u2013brain barrier  has evolved to prevent pathogens getting out of the blood capillaries \ninto the extracellular fluid that bathes the neurons. The barrier is formed by specialised epithelial cells that are highly selective, allowing only beneficial molecules through.\nMicrobiota\nNon-pathogenic bacteria that live in the body are known as normal flora, and form a microbiological barrier against pathogens. Normal flora live in many locations in the body, including the skin, digestive tract, mouth, nose and vagina. The presence of normal flora helps prevent \npathogenic bacteria  from being able to grow, as they compete with the \npathogen for resources and space.\nCheck-in questions \u2013 Set 1\n1 Apart from physical barriers, what other forms of barriers aid the first line of defence?\n2 Outline why it is important for skin to be intact.\n3 What is the difference between pathogenic bacteria and normal flora?\n4 What type of barrier is lysozyme?LINK7B SECOND \nLINE OF DEFENCE\nPathogenic \nbacteria bacteria that cause harm and an immune response\nWORKSHEET 7A\u20131  \nFIRST LINE OF \nDEFENCE ANIMALS DOCBlood\u2013brain \nbarrier a barrier of specialised epithelial cells in the brain and spinal cord that prevents pathogens and toxins reaching the neurons\n285 7A FIRST  LINE  OF DEFENCE\n",
  "Page 298": "Barriers in plants\nPhysical\nThe main physical barrier for plants is a thickened cell wall. This acts as a thick barrier that is \nhard for pathogens to penetrate. The thicker the cell wall, the more effective it is at preventing pathogens from entering the plant. Covering the surface of the leaf is a waxy cuticle, which helps prevent water from pooling (collecting) on the surface of the leaf and ensures that the water runs off, reducing opportunities for any water-based pathogen to enter the leaf. It also prevents pathogens from coming into direct contact with epidermal cells.\nThe biggest weak point \nfor a plant is its open stomata. These openings, which are essential for gas exchange by the plant during photosynthesis, can be closed to help prevent pathogens from entering.\nSome plants have thick \nbark, which acts as a thick physical barrier preventing the entry of pathogens. The bark in some plants also drops from the plant and in doing so can take the pathogen with it.\nChemical\nPlant chemical barriers include enzymes that disrupt the cell walls of fungi or bacteria, preventing them from functioning normally. Plants can also produce antibacterial compounds to inhibit bacterial growth, and we use some of these to make antiseptics. More specific examples are given in Table 7A\u20131. \nMicrobiota\nNon-pathogenic bacteria that live in and around the roots of plants have a similar role to those that live in and on the body of humans. They form a microbiological barrier against pathogens. Similarly, they help prevent pathogens from growing, as they compete with the pathogens for resources and space.\nThe key thing to note is that plants have the first line of \ndefence, but lack any further immune system responses like those of animals.Figure 7A\u20137 The bark of a tree is a physical barrier to pathogens.\nFigure 7A\u20138 Mint produces a \nchemical defence in the form of antibacterial chemicals.\nCheck-in questions \u2013 Set 2\n1 What types of barriers do plants have to defend themselves against pathogens?\n2 List three examples of barriers in plants.DOCWORKSHEET \n7A\u20132 FIRST LINE \nOF DEFENCE \nPLANTS 5A  \nPHOTOSYNTHESISLINK\n286\nCHAPTER 7 IMMUNITY: LINES OF DEFENCE\n",

These substances could be things such as peanuts, pollen or cat hair, which are referred to as allergens. Recent Australian data has indicated that 10% of children under the age of one year have a food allergy, while 19% of all age groups self-report as having hay fever.\nAn allergic reaction can cause symptoms such as itching, swelling, rash (redness) and \nshortness of breath.\nA severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis. The rate of \nnew cases of anaphylaxis has been estimated to be one new case per 5000 people per year.\nAlthough the allergic response is not part of the course, it relates closely to the \ninflammatory and adaptive immune responses.\nThe key thing to note is that an allergic response is an abnormal process of something \nthat would normally occur to protect you if you were ill due to a pathogenic infection.\nFigure 7B\u20131 Pollen being blown by wind Figure 7B\u20132 An allergic reaction causing hives over \nan arm\n288\nCHAPTER 7 IMMUNITY: LINES OF DEFENCE\n",

A cut in the skin allows bacteria to enter the body, or a virus can be transmitted in droplets from someone sneezing and enter via the respiratory system, nose or eyes.

The causes of these autoimmune diseases are unknown, but there appears to be a genetic link. Autoimmune diseases can be grouped into two categories: localised (organ specific) or systemic. Some common examples of autoimmune diseases are rheumatoid arthritis, type I diabetes and multiple sclerosis.\nRheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that targets joints, causing painful \nswelling. Over time, the inflammation can cause bone erosion and joint deformity. There is currently no cure, but physiotherapy and medication can be used to slow the progression of the disease.\nMultiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that targets the myelin sheath of nerves in \nthe central nervous system, disrupting communication between the brain and the body.

Unlike the innate immune response, the adaptive immune response is highly specific to antigens and forms \nimmunological memory . The immune system\u2019s ability to remember the antigen, \nand therefore the pathogen, means that upon reinfection by the same pathogen, the immune response will be faster and stronger. This results in immunity against a pathogen, which is the basis of vaccination programs.\nThe adaptive immune response is carried out by white blood cells called lymphocytes, \nwhich consist of two main groups of cells: B cells and T cells.LINK7E ACTIVE \nAND PASSIVE IMMUNITY\nFigure 7D\u20133 Production and maturation sites of B and T lymphocytesT cell\nBone marrow\nStem cell\nB cells mature in\nthe bone marrow and\nthen migrate to the\nlymph nodeT cells mature in the\nthymus and then\nmigrate to the\nlymph nodeThymus\nLymph nodeImmunological \nmemory the ability of the immune system to quickly and specifically recognise an antigen that the body has previously encountered and initiate a corresponding immune response\nB cells help perform the main role of the humoral \nimmune response, and T cells are associated with the cell-mediated immune response.\nHumoral immunity involves B cells being activated \nand secreting specific antibodies, a special protein called immunoglobulins. The antibodies that have been secreted circulate in the bloodstream and target non-self antigens that are in the extracellular space.\nIn contrast, in the cell-mediated immune response, \nT cells target host cells that have been infected by a pathogen, such as a virus. The antigen from the virus is presented by the infected host cell to the T cell, and this instructs the T cell to induce the virus-infected cell to die. This helps prevent the virus replicating and invading more cells. T cells also assist in killing cancerous cells or cells from transplanted tissue organs (leading to transplant rejection).\nFigure 7D\u20134 Overview of the adaptive immune response\nCell-mediated\nimmune response\nAdaptive response\n3rd line of defence\nHumoral immune\nresponse\n\u2022 Naive B cells\n\u2022 Memory B cells\u2022 Plasma B cells\u2022 Antibodies\u2022 Naive T cells\u2022 Memory T cells\u2022 Helper T cells\u2022 Cytotoxic T cellsLINK7C THE \nLYMPHATIC SYSTEMVIDEO 7D\u20131 ADAPTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSE SUMMARY\n301 7D THIRD  LINE  OF DEFENCE\n",

The non-self antigen acts as the selecting agent, activating the correct naive B cell, which initiates the humoral immune response. This theory is known as \nclonal selection theory  (Figure 7D\u20136).\nWithin the lymph node are millions of naive  B cells with unique antibody  receptors \n(about 105 antibody receptors on each B cell) that have complementary antigen-binding \nsites to different antigens. When a non-self antigen enters a lymph node and selects the corresponding naive B cell (assisted by a helper T cell), the naive B cell proliferates, making many clones of itself. This \nclonal expansion  results in identical copies of the naive B cell \nthat have the same genetic material and antibody receptor as the original naive B cell. The clones then differentiate into memory B and plasma B cells.\n302\nCHAPTER 7 IMMUNITY: LINES OF DEFENCE\n",

Unlike the plasma cells, which survive for a few days, the memory cells can last a long time (occasionally for life). This is what leads to long-term immunity.

The APC can be a macrophage, dendritic cell or naive B cell. The APC comes from the site of infection (not a B cell, which is located in the lymph node with the T cells) and travels to the lymph node. The APC has phagocytosed the pathogen and presents a fragment of the antigen on its MHC II marker.\n2\n The APC needs to find the complementary TCR on a naive T cell. Once located, the naive T cell proliferates into \neffector cells .\n3 Effector cells include helper T cells (Th) and cytotoxic T cells (Tc). Memory T cells \nare also produced and aid in long-term immunity, just like memory B cells from the humoral response.\n4\n The effector Th activates macrophages at the site of infection to carry out further \nphagocytosis, and they also activate Tc cells to kill infected host cells.Effector cell \na cell that has been activated to perform its role7B SECOND LINE \nOF DEFENCELINK\n308\nCHAPTER 7 IMMUNITY: LINES OF DEFENCE\n",

Perforin is a protein that forms pores in the cell\u2019s membrane.

You need to be able to categorise the different immune responses and then place those components into a sequential order. You also need to be able to compare the different responses. For example, you might be required to compare a virus to a bacterial infection, a humoral response to a cell-mediated response, the second line to the third line, or physical barriers to chemical barriers.\nA useful strategy is to create a simple comparative graphic organiser. This is a tool that \nyou can use to directly identify similarities and differences.

By April 2021, Australia had recorded 30  000 cases with over \n900 deaths, and worldwide there had been more than 132 million cases with more than \n2.86 million deaths.\nThis novel virus has caused governments around the world to implement a wide range \nof strategies to keep people safe and reduce the number of cases. One country, Sweden, took a very different course of action, with the intention of generating herd immunity within the population as a tool to battle the virus. This was in contrast to the more common strategy of lockdowns implemented elsewhere. The reasoning behind the herd immunity approach is that, if there were to be a sec\nond wave of the virus, a large \nproportion of the population would already be immune and therefore the virus would not spread. Time will tell, as the world looks back and reflects on which strategies have been most effective in reducing the impact of COVID-19.\nEXPLAIN\nAcquiring immunity\nSection 7D explored how the adaptive immune response results in immunity through the establishment of memory B and T cells. This section examines two ways of acquiring immunity: active and passive. Each of these has a natural and an artificial way of acquiring immunity. The terms \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018artificial\u2019 have particular connotations \u2013 that natural is organic and therefore better for you, and artificial is chemically engineered or genetically modified, and causes harm. This is not the case. A key skill for you is to be able to identify the differences between the ways of acquiring immunity as either active or passive.\nTypes of immunity\nActive immunity  occurs when an individual\u2019s adaptive immune system responds to an \nantigen, producing not only specific antibodies but also memory B and T cells. The individual gains immunological memory, which can last a lifetime.\nWhen an individual is provided with antibodies that have been made by another organism, \nthis results in \npassive immunity . This type of immunity is immediate but does not \nresult in any long-term memory of the pathogen that causes a disease and therefore no immunological memory. This is because the individual\u2019s adaptive immune response has not been activated, and hence they have no specific antibodies or memory B and T cells.Active immunity \nwhen an individual\u2019s adaptive immune response is activated\nPassive immunity short-term immunity resulting from a person receiving antibodies from another person or animal; no memory\n312\nCHAPTER 7 IMMUNITY: LINES OF DEFENCE\n",

The maternal antibodies provide immune protection for the baby, whose immune system is still developing.\nArtificial meansArtificial active immunity is created when antigens or whole pathogens are deliberately introduced to induce an adaptive immune response (production of specific antibodies and \nmemory B and T cells) through a vaccination, for example.Artificial passive immunity is created when an individual receives antibodies made by another organism. This is useful against things such as bites \nand stings that could cause death before an individual\u2019s own adaptive immune response could act.\n 313 7E ACTIVE  AND PASSIVE  IMMUNITY\n",
  "Page 326": "Check-in question \u2013 Set 1\n1 List the four ways in which individuals can acquire immunity.\n2 Which strategies lead to long-term immunity?\n3 If someone were to be vaccinated against COVID-19, which type of strategy for \nacquiring immunity would this be?\nVaccination programs and herd immunity\nVaccinations  involve the use of a vaccine  to induce artificial active immunity. To induce an \nadaptive immune response, the vaccine needs to be specific to the pathogen. Three types of vaccines can be used to do this: live attenuated, inactivated and subunit.\nA live \nattenuated  vaccine contains a weakened form of the pathogen that causes the disease \nthe vaccine is intended to give immunity against. Because of the similarity between the \nvaccine and the natural pathogen, there is a strong adaptive immune response. This can result in lifetime protection against that pathogen. There is a limitation with this type of vaccine: a person who has a weakened immune system (e.g. elderly, babies, immune-deficient individuals, cancer patients) may contract the disease, and so people in this group need to speak with their health-care provider before considering this type of vaccine. Some examples of live attenuated vaccines are those against measles, mumps, rubella (MMR combined vaccine); smallpox; and chickenpox.\nAn inactivated vaccine uses a killed version of the pathogen that causes the disease. (Note \nthat technically viruses are not living so it is better to talk about them being either viable or inactivated.) Nothing in the inactivated vaccine is harmful, so it is safe for people with weakened immune systems to receive. A disadvantage of this type of vaccine is that there is no lifelong immunity, so booster vaccinations are required to maintain long-term immunity, by increasing the number of memory B and T cells. Examples of inactivated vaccines are those against hepatitis A and influenza.\nA subunit vaccine uses specific pieces of the pathogen, such as parts of antigens, whole \nantigens, or a capsid (protein coat of viruses). As with inactivated vaccines, people with weakened immune systems can safely be adminstered a subunit vaccine, because it does not contain any viable components of the pathogen. It has the same disadvantage as an inactivated vaccine \u2013 booster injections are required to maintain the required levels of memory B and T cells. Examples of subunit vaccines are those against hepatitis B, human papillomavirus and whooping cough.\nHerd immunity\nHerd immunity  exists when a large percentage of the population has been immunised against \na contagious disease. This is vital for any immunisation program to be successful. Herd immunity indirectly provides protection to individuals in the community who are not immune. This includes those with suppressed or weakened immune systems, people with immune diseases, babies, the elderly and individuals taking immunosuppressant medications. Herd immunity can be likened to trying to find a needle in a haystack: if there is widespread immunity in a population (that is, herd immunity), then there is very little chance that an infected person will encounter someone who is not immune, and so the pathogen has very little opportunity to invade a new host, and the disease is not able to spread (Figure 7E\u20132).Vaccination \nthe administration of a vaccine to cause an adaptive immune response\nVaccine \nsubstance that contains an agent (usually an antigen or an attenuated version of the pathogen)that will induce an adaptive immune response when administered\nHerd immunity when a large percentage of a population is immune to a disease (through vaccination), slowing the spread of the disease and protecting those who are not immuneAttenuated describes a pathogen that has been altered to remove its harmfulness\n314\nCHAPTER 7 IMMUNITY: LINES OF DEFENCE\n",

A further strategy to increase your memory is dual coding.\nDual coding means making an association between written information and an image. \nUsing images helps to build your understanding of a concept while also retrieving information about the concept. When you are making flip cards, draw an image on one side and write the definition on the other side. When building a mind map, instead of using words you can use images or diagrams to highlight connections between concepts.\nThe images you use can be abstract or concrete. An abstract image does not have \ncomplete connection with the concept being covered, whereas a concrete image is an actual (realistic) representation of the concept or term. Table 7E\u20132 is an example of dual coding, where the images can help you remember and understand a concept.VIDEO 7E\u20131  \nSKILLS: PICTURE REPRESENTATION: DUAL CODING\n315 7E ACTIVE  AND PASSIVE  IMMUNITY\n",

Over time, new diseases \nhave emerged, and continue to emerge to this day, with COVID-19 an example. Not only do new diseases arise, but old diseases can re-emerge if the pathogen develops resistance to medications or if vaccination lapses.\nIt is important for governments and individuals to do their part in preventing a pathogen from \nspreading between individuals within the community. In order to put effective control measures in place, epidemiologists need to understand the infectious cycle of a disease. Considerations such as how transmission occurs, whether there are vectors involved and where the disease comes from all help the formulation of a plan to fight the disease.\nA new strategy in fighting disease involves monoclonal antibodies. This strategy begins with the \nnatural process of how the immune system works and manipulates it to our advantage, to create treatments. The ability to tailor treatments for cancers and autoimmune diseases is the future of medical research.UNIT \n4\nEMERGENCE AND TREATMENT OF NEW DISEASES CHAPTER \n8 \n322\n",

Harsh measures at times polarised the community. Epidemiology featured in everyday conversations. Experts were sometimes divided on the best strategies, while a minority of non-experts spread misinformation and refused to cooperate. At times, science was politicised, arguments raged, and social consequences proliferated in ways rarely experienced in modern times. In 2021, the largest-ever vaccine program in Australia began, but the controversies continued, demonstrating that the social aspects of disease control need as much attention as the scientific ones.\n \nFigure 8A\u20131 Captain James Cook and the monument to his landing, \nDuncombe Bay, Norfolk IslandEXPLAIN\nEuropeans brought disease\nIn 1770, Lieutenant James Cook mapped the eastern coast of Australia. The First Fleet \nfollowed, arriving in Sydney in 1788. The most immediate consequence of colonisation by Europeans was a wave of epidemic diseases including smallpox, typhoid, pneumonia, whooping cough, venereal diseases, measles and influenza, to name a few.\nMany of the European colonist \npopulations had resistance to diseases like measles, bronchitis and scarlet fever, as they had already been exposed to the responsible pathogens before arriving in Australia. However, these diseases spread rapidly through, and annihilated, many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, who had never been exposed before.\n325 8A EMERGENC E, RE-EMERGEN CE AND DISEASE  CONTAIN MENT\n",
  "Page 338": "Getting the terms straight\nBefore this chapter explores how disease \nemerges or re-emerges, it is important to understand some key terms. Chapter 6 explored what pathogens are, and Chapter 7 covered how the human body and plants deal with pathogens. To recap: pathogens have the capacity to cause disease. A \ndisease  is not to be confused with an \ninfection . An infection occurs when a pathogen \nhas breached the first line of defence and has started to replicate within the host. In contrast, a disease is a consequence of the pathogen\u2019s invasion causing damage and having an impact on the normal function of the body\u2019s tissues.\nTwo more associated terms are \nvirulence  and contagious . Virulence is the likelihood that \na pathogen, once it is in the body, will cause disease and harm to the host. A contagious \npathogen is one that is able to spread between individuals. For example, the polio virus has low virulence (most people who catch the disease experience flu-like symptoms; paralysis occurs in fewer than 1% of cases), but it is highly contagious (it is easy to catch the virus from an infected person). Ebola, on the other hand, has a 50\u201390% \nfatality  rate (high \nvirulence) but it is more difficult to catch the virus (less contagious).LINK CHAPTER 6It is estimated that, within 15\u00a0months of the First Fleet\u2019s arrival, around half of the Aboriginal peoples living in the Sydney area had died from smallpox. Even before Europeans began arriving in the Melbourne area, smallpox had spread southwards from Sydney and had killed around a third of the eastern Aboriginal peoples.\nThe spread of smallpox was followed by influenza, measles, \ntuberculosis and venereal diseases, which Aboriginal peoples had no resistance to, and which brought widespread death.\nIn addition, European invasion had adverse consequences \nfor the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander \ncommunities through alterations to their diet and lifestyle. These factors can have a negative impact on the functioning of the immune system and lead to an increase in disease.\n \u2022Diet: access to traditional foods was restricted (due to fencing of lands, farming of sheep and cattle, and hunting of native animals), rationing was imposed (low quality and low quantity of foods), and many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples were forced to adopt a European style of diet (high sugar and flour based).\n \u2022Lifestyle: nomadic life morphed into a more stationary lifestyle. Instead of moving in small groups, managing their impact on the land, more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples lived in one place, which increased exposure to and spread of pathogens. Some pathogens were fatal, some caused a decline in health, and others affected fertility.\nThis history of Europeans colonising Australia is an example of emerging disease and the dramatic impact it can have on communities. Note that the course only covers diseases spread by pathogens, so mental health issues and disease\ns of lifestyle, such as diabetes, are \nnot included. However, ill health from such causes can lead to reduced immune system function and hence susceptibility to pathogens.\nFigure 8A\u20132 Traditional Aboriginal foods\nDisease \nany condition that affects the normal function of either a part of an organism or the complete organism \nInfection \nwhen a pathogen has breached the first line of defence and begun to replicate\nVirulence how likely a pathogen is to cause harm/disease\nContagious \ndescribes a pathogen that is able to spread from an infected person to others\nFatality \nthe occurrence of death\nFigure 8A\u20133 Transmission electron \nmicrograph of an Ebola virus.

Individuals with polio can experience flu-like symptoms including sore throat, fever, nausea and stomach pain or, in extreme and rare instances, life-threatening paralysis.Professionals who study and track the emergence \nand re-emergence of diseases are called \nepidemiologists . In 2021, the Australian Chief \nMedical Officer, Professor Paul Kelly, is an epidemiologist assisting in the battle against COVID-19. The Victorian Chief Medical Officer, Professor Brett Sutton, and the Victorian Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Dr Annaliese van Diemen, are experts in contagious diseases, and their work focuses on preventing and understanding the spread of \ninfectious  diseases between people.\nEmergence and re-emergence of \npathogens\nAn emerging infectious disease  is one that has \nnot occurred in humans before, or has occurred \npreviously but affected only a small number of people, or has occurred throughout time but has only recently been recognised as a disease. In 2007, a report by the World Health Organization (WHO) warned of the threat of emerging infectious diseases. Since the late 1970s, approximately 40 new infectious diseases have been discovered. Examples are SARS, Ebola, avian flu, swine flu, Zika and, more recently, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\nContrast this with \nre-emerging infectious diseases , which are diseases that were once \npresent and had a dramatic decline in case numbers but have returned and are affecting a \nsignificant proportion of the population.\nReasons for emerging infectious diseases\nA significant contributing factor to the emergence of diseases is human behaviour, and changes in behaviour. Some changes that have occurred over time are:\n \u2022population growth \u2013 more people are living in closer proximity to each other, providing more opportunities for pathogens to be transmitted between hosts\n \u2022international and domestic travel \u2013 spreading disease is easier and tracking the origins of disease outbreaks is harder\n \u2022poverty \u2013 sanitation and water conditions may be lower in quality, causing higher rates of transmission, both direct (for example, lack of water for washing after contact with an infected person) and \nindirect transmission  (for example, water-borne pathogens in \nuntreated water)\n \u2022ecological damage \u2013 the spread of human populations means that more humans live \ncloser to wild animals, making it more likely that pathogens will be passed from animals to humans\n \u2022food supply chains \u2013 transporting food long distances makes tracing the origins of pathogens associated with the food more difficult\n \u2022intensive farming \u2013 more animals are kept in smaller spaces that are closer to humans, which increases the chance of pathogen transmission to humans.\nHuman contribution to climate change is also becoming a contributing factor. As the \nclimate is getting warmer and habitats are changing, diseases are now potentially able to spread into geographical areas they may not previously have survived in. An example is \nwarmer conditions enabling mosquitoes, particularly those capable of transmitting malaria and dengue fever to humans, to move into areas they once\n would not have inhabited.Epidemiologist \nprofessional who studies the occurrence of diseases in a population\nInfectious \nable to be transmitted between hosts\nEmerging infectious disease a disease not yet seen in people, or a disease that is increasing in incidence or geographical range\nRe-emerging \ninfectious disease a disease that appears again after having previously been eliminated\nIndirect transmission transmission of a pathogen from a location where it has been away from its host for a long timeVIDEO 8A\u20131 THE \nEMERGENCE OF COVID-19\nLINK6B CELLULAR PATHOGENS\n327 8A EMERGENC E, RE-EMERGEN CE AND DISEASE  CONTAIN MENT\n",
  "Page 340": "Case study in the emergence of a new infectious disease: COVID-19\nCOVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by a \nnew RNA virus, a coronavirus similar to the cold virus. The first case of COVID-19 was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The World Health Organization declared a global pandemic in March 2020. By May 2021 there had been more than 164 million cases worldwide with more than 3.4 million deaths, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history, as well as having an enormous economic and social impact.\nThe main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever or chills; cough; \nnasal congestion or runny nose; muscle ache, tiredness and headache; and difficulty breathing. It can progress to serious pneumonia, with the already-sick and elderly being more and more susceptible. \nAirborne transmission of the virus is in droplets released from the mouth and nose breathed in by others. \nThis is more likely to happen in close and confined spaces. Transmission by indirect contact, touching a contaminated surface and then touching the lips or nose is a lesser route.\nThe SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is believed to have been endemic in a wild animal population, possibly \nbats, and to have infected the first humans in a so called \u2018wet market\u2019, but this route has not been proven. Other respiratory diseases have jumped from animals to humans in the past and epidemiologists have been warning of this danger for decades.\nTo fight the virus different strategies were adopted. Prevention of spread has been the priority in Australia \nwith strong measures including widespread testing for the virus, restrictions of movements and gatherings, border closures, quarantining, social distancing and compulsory mask wearing. These have required public health campaigns, legal and public order measures, economic support for those losing income, and a major reorientation of work, education and social life into digital channels. In addition the supply of personal protective equipment for health workers has been vital.\nDrugs have not proven effective in stopping the virus and treatment is mainly confined to the relief of \nsymptoms, such as providing oxygen to aid breathing. New technologies such as monoclonal antibodies are also being tried.\nWithin days of the first outbreaks the largest vaccine development program in history began, using new \ntechnologies in some cases. The first vaccines were in use inside 12 months, a dramatic shortening of the usual development. In 2020 Australia brought in a phased program, first vaccinating all quarantine, border and frontline health staff, along with the elderly, immunocompromised and already-sick, and \nthen moving to other groups. Vaccination appears to reduce but not stop transmission, but its main effect is reducing the severity of the disease.\nDuring 2021 the main problem that developed was mutation \nof the virus into new and more transmissible strains, with fears that vaccination would be less effective against them. Genomic sequencing of the strains became a vital tool against them. Vaccination continued to be the main strategy in Australia and most of the world.  \nSee also Video 8A\u20131 The emergence of COVID-19 in the \nInteractive Textbook.Pathogen: SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus)Mode of transmission: direct transmission through the exchange of droplets\nFigure 8A\u20136 Vaccination programs are the \nmain strategy for combatting COVID-19\nFigure 8A\u20135 An illustration of monoclonal antibodies (Y-shapes) being used to attack COVID-19 coronaviruses.\n328\nCHAPTER 8 EMERGENCE AND TREATMENT OF NEW DISEASES\n",
  "Page 341": "Reasons for re-emerging diseases\nThere are two key reasons for a disease to re-emerge: resistance or evolution of a pathogen, \nand a drop in vaccination numbers. An example is penicillin, an antibiotic. Penicillin was introduced in the 1940s for clinical use against bacteria. Alexander Fleming, who discovered penicillin, noticed that by 1943 bacteria were showing signs of resistance to penicillin. Three years later, medical staff in a London hospital estimated that 14% of patients with bacterial infections were showing resistance to penicillin treatment. Today it is estimated that 90% of staphylococcal bacteria are completely resistant to penicillin.\nMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multi-drug-resistant \nMycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are two species of bacteria that are resistant to any antibiotic. MRSA causes skin infections and, in some cases, pneumonia. MDR-TB mostly affects the lungs but is not limited to that area. Symptoms include persistent cough, fever, night sweats and loss of appetite.\nFigure 8A\u20137 MRSA colonies on an agar plate\n Figure 8A\u20138 Tuberculosis infection affects the lungs.\nBacteria can either mutate or exchange genetic material with other bacteria of the same or different species. Mutations of bacterial genes could result in the bacteria being able to:\n \u2022prevent drugs from adhering to their surface\n \u2022decrease the permeability of their plasma membrane to drugs\n \u2022actively pump out the drug\n \u2022use enzymes that destroy the action of the drug.\nThe likelihood of a mutation being beneficial is low. The exchange of genetic material where a mutation has occurred is more likely. One way in which genetic material is \nexchanged between bacteria is through a process called conjugation, in which the pilus from one bacterium extends and joins that of another bacterium, forming a bridge enabling the plasmid DNA to be exchanged between the two bacteria. The plasmid could then for example, contain a gene that increases the bacterium\u2019s ability to survive medications.\nMutation and exchange of genetic \nmaterial between bacteria are rare, but the widespread use of antibiotics is acting as a \nselection \npressure  driving the evolution \nof stronger and more resistant pathogens. For example, the antibiotics being used will kill most of the bacteria, but any that survive are now resistant and pass on the resistance when they divide  Furthermore, with higher population densities, Transfer of plasmid DNA from a donor cell to a recipient cell\nTwo pili join to form a bridge\nFigure 8A\u20139 Bacterial conjugation, whereby a plasmid migrates from one \nbacterial cell to another via a bridge formed by piliSelection \npressure the conditions or factors that influence allele frequencies in a population by contributing to the selection of which phenotypes survive in a given environment, e.g. availability of resources, environmental conditions, predators and disease\n329 8A EMERGENC E, RE-EMERGEN CE AND DISEASE  CONTAIN MENT\n",
  "Page 342": "more people are living closer to each other, allowing easier exchange and providing a rich \nhabitat for pathogenic bacteria to live alongside non-pathogenic bacteria. This provides a further opportunity for bacteria to experience mutations and to exchange genetic material between pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria.\nThe second reason for the re-emergence of diseases is a decline in vaccination programs. When a well-established vaccination program is successful, some individuals may choose not to vaccinate. An example of this occurring is with measles in the United States. Measles was eliminated from the United States in 2000, but returned in 2019, due to an increase in the number of people opting to not vaccinate their children. This was somewhat fuelled by an anti-vaccination movement spreading invalid claims from a discredited study that linked the measles vaccine with autism. By October 2019, a total of 1249 cases of measles had been reported.\nCheck-in questions \u2013 Set 1\n1  What is a disease?\n2  What does it mean if a disease is highly contagious?\n3  What is an emerging disease?\n4  List three reasons why a disease may emerge.\n5  Describe how European colonisation would be a source of emerging diseases. \nPreventing the spread of pathogens\nDuring the COVID-19 outbreak, a range of measures were implemented by the Australian and Victorian medical officers, to ensure the safety of the community.

This textbook has suggested a range of strategies to adopt or modify, to help build your memory. A large part of that memory work is in associating particular terms with their correct context. Not only that, but when answering a question that has follow-up parts, you need to be mindful when choosing the term or concept you are going to use in your answer, as your choice will have flow-on effects.\nThe parts of a question generally build in complexity. A question may start by asking \nyou to recall or identify, then require you to practise your application skills, and finish by asking you to explain or interpret. Some questions also have a consequential flow. It is important that you look at the question as a whole (during your initial reading time) so that you are aware that what you contribute in the first part of a question will flow on into the subsequent parts. For example:\nQuestion\na  Identify a control measure in preventing the spread of a pathogen.  (1 mark)\nb  Explain why this control measure works.  (2 marks)\nIn order to gain the first mark, you have a wide range of answers to choose from. \nWhat you need to be mindful of is how strong you are in your explanation of what you identified.

The main types of immunotherapy include monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) , \nnon-specific immunotherapies and cancer vaccines. The focus of this section is mAbs.\nAs discussed in Section 7D, antibodies are produced naturally during the adaptive immune \nresponse, to target the specific non-self antigens of pathogens. Monoclonal antibodies are made in the laboratory to work in the same way. \u2018Monoclonal\u2019 here means an antibody made in quantity by cloning one parent immune cell. There are numerous types and they can be made to target a variety of cells and substances. Here we will discuss these main types of monoclonal antibodies that target cancer cells and the causes of autoimmune diseases:\n \u2022Bispecific mAbs attach to target cells to signal for an immune response.\n \u2022Conjugated mAbs deliver a cytotoxic or radioactive \u2018payload\u2019 directly to the target cell.LINK7D THIRD LINE \nOF DEFENCE\n334\nCHAPTER 8 EMERGENCE AND TREATMENT OF NEW DISEASES\n",
  "Page 347": "Bispecific monoclonal antibodies\nIn Section 7D you learned about the shape and \nspecificity with which antibodies bind with specific antigens, and that the antigen-binding sites are the same on each arm of an antibody. A \nbispecific \nmonoclonal antibody  is laboratory-made with two \ndifferent antigen-binding sites, so it can attach to two different antigens at one time.\nAn example of a bispecific mAb is blinatumomab \n(Blincyto\n\u00ae), which is used to treat different types of \nthe blood cancer leukaemia. One arm of the mAb binds to a CD19 receptor of the leukaemia cell, while the other arm attaches to the CD3 receptor of a T\nc \ncell (Figure 8B\u20132). The action of this mAb ensures that the T cell from the adaptive immune system comes into direct contact with a cancer cell, where it can perform its role in destroying the cancerous cell.\nConjugated monoclonal antibodies\nA conjugated monoclonal antibody  is one that \nhas been combined with a chemotherapy drug (a cytotoxin) or radioactive substance (Figure 8B\u20133). The conjugated mAb can be used to deliver the drug or radioactive substance directly to the cancerous cells, preventing their growth and lessening the damage to healthy cells in the area.\nAn example of a conjugated mAb is \nrituximab, which is used to deliver a radioactive substance to fight diseases such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Rituximab targets the CD20 receptor of a B cell. As non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer of the immune system, there are abnormal B cells; this treatment targets those cells and delivers the radioactive substance to stop their growth.\nMonoclonal antibodies against autoimmune diseases\nAutoimmune diseases are a malfunction of the immune system. Using drugs against the malfunctioning cells is difficult due to the risk of weakening the immune system so much that it allows pathogens to take hold. Ideally, treatments should specifically target only the malfunctioning cells or molecules of the immune system, not the whole system. \nIn 2017 the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration approved a monoclonal antibody \ndrug called ocrelizumab as the first approved treatment for primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Ocrelizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 receptor of B cells. It reduces the attacks by the immune cells on the central nervous system, and has been shown to be a successful treatment for MS.\nAnti-inflammatory monoclonal antibodies are also used to inhibit cytokines that \nare involved in abnormal inflammatory responses, such as in rheumatoid arthritis, inflammation and ulcers of the colon. Another example is the use of mAbs to inhibit IgE involved in moderate to severe allergic asthma.Bispecific \nmonoclonal antibody a monoclonal antibody that has two different antigen-binding sitesTc cell\nCD3 receptor CD19 receptorPerforin\nBispeci\ufb01c monoclonal antibodyCancer cell\nFigure 8B\u20132 The bispecific monoclonal antibody has \ndifferent antigen-binding sites on its two arms, so it is able to join a cancer cell with a T cell, which enables the T cell to perform its role and kill the cancer cell.\nConjugated \nmonoclonal antibody an antibody that has been combined with a radioactive substance or chemotherapy agent (a cytotoxin)Cancer cell\n(abnormal B cell)\nConjugated\nmonoclonal\nantibodyCD20 receptor\nRadioactive substance\nFigure 8B\u20133 Conjugated monoclonal antibody \nwith radioactive substance associated with it.

X-rays were unable to reveal a single fracture in his body! In fact, they showed that this young man had a bone density eight times higher than other men his age. A team of scientists investigated further and found that he and 21 other members of his family have a mutation that disrupts the functioning of a gene called LRP5. In the past, researchers had recorded that a mutation in the LRP5 gene caused osteoporosis, a condition that makes bones brittle and weak. However, it now appears that a different type of mutation in the same gene could have the opposite effect, giving some people extremely dense bones that are practically unbreakable.\nThis section looks at different types of \nmutations, including beneficial mutations like the one on LRP5, all from the perspective of evolution. The focus is on how mutations can change the genetic make-up of individuals and, over time, influence the genetic information in a population, causing evolution to occur.\nFigure 9A\u20131 A mutation in the gene LRP5 \ncan cause weak and brittle bones, but another type of mutation in the same gene can cause the opposite \u2013 unbreakable bones.\n346\nCHAPTER 9 EVOLUTION: GENETIC CHANGES IN POPULATIONS OVER TIME\n",
  "Page 359": "EXPLAIN\nIntroducing evolution\nRevisiting key ideas\nWorking through Units 1\u20133 of VCE Biology, you\u2019ve learnt many of the key ideas that are \nthe foundations for understanding evolution. To recap:\n \u2022DNA is a type of nucleic acid that contains genes.\n \u2022Genes are sections of DNA containing the nucleotide sequence that codes for the production of a polypeptide or protein.\n \u2022There are alternative forms of genes, called alleles, and these code for variations of a specific trait or characteristic.\n \u2022For each gene locus, one allele is inherited from the mother and one from the father, and together they form the \ngenotype  of the individual.\n \u2022The genetic make-up or genotype of an individual and the influence of the environment both contribute to the \nphenotype , or expression of the \nphysical characteristic the gene codes for.\n \u2022Sexual reproduction and meiosis can increase the variation, or diversity, of the genetic material in an individual through crossing over, independent assortment, random mating and non-disjunction.\n \u2022Changing the genetic material of an individual may alter the range of phenotypes expressed in a population.\n \u2022Increasing the genetic diversity  of a population (having more genetic variation \nbetween individuals in a population) increases the chance of survival of a species.\n \u2022Adaptations  are the behavioural, physiological and structural features of an \norganism that help them survive and flourish in an environment.\nVariation\nThere is always variation between the phenotypes of individuals in a population. This variation results from the different combinations of alleles (genotypes) that have arisen due to sexual reproduction and meiosis, and the influence of the environment. For example, a plant may have a genotype that allows it to grow tall, but it will only be able to do so if it has access to all the requirements for growth. If these requirements are lacking, then the plant will not grow to the size determined by its genotype. The environment has influenced the phenotype.\nThere are other types of variation that may be present in a population.  \nFor example:\n \u2022morphological: differences in the structure of an organism; for example, body shape, tail length in dogs\n \u2022behavioural: differences in patterns of activity; for example dog \nbehaviour (herding, retrieval, guarding)\n \u2022biochemical: differences in the composition of cells; for example, blood \ngroups and the different pigments in cat hair\n \u2022physiological: differences in the functioning of an organism; for example, differences in people\u2019s ability to detect tastes, odours and colours\n \u2022developmental: differences that occur as an organism ages; for example, a snake changing colour over time\n \u2022geographic: differences in location; for example, different possum body mass in different \nregions of Australia.Figure 9A\u20132 Top: Juvenile green tree \npythons (Morelia viridis) are either bright yellow or red.

  "Page 360": "It is important to note that when we talk about evolution, we are not focusing on one \nindividual but on all the individuals of a species living in the same region at the same time. This is the definition of a \npopulation . A species  is a group of organisms that can interbreed \nand produce fertile and viable offspring in their natural environment (explored further in Section 9D).\nThe gene pool and allele frequency\nA gene pool  is the sum total of alleles \npresent in a population of organisms. For example, consider Figure 9A\u20133. In this simplified gene pool, there are 6 individuals and 12 alleles, as each individual has two copies of a gene (one from their mother and one from their father). We can use gene pools to determine \nallele frequency , which is the \nproportion of a particular allele within a population. In this case, D has a frequency of 8/12 (67%) in the population and d has a frequency of 4/12 (33%).\nThe range of variations possible in a population is limited by the alleles that are available in \nthe gene pool. In a large gene pool, there is likely to be a greater number of different alleles, and therefore more genetic diversity, while in a small gene pool, there is likely to be less genetic diversity.\nDefining evolution\nWhen the allele frequencies in a population changes over many generations, the population is said to be evolving. Therefore, \nevolution  can be defined as a change in the allele \nfrequencies of a population over time. These changes result in diversification within a species. In Section 9D you will explore changes that occur over a long period of geological time (such as eras or epochs) and result in the emergence of new species.\nWhat causes allele frequencies in a population to change?\nTable 9A\u20131 Factors that result in changing allele frequences over time\nFactor Explanation\nGene flow The movement of alleles into (or out of) a population as a result of \nmigration\nGenetic drift Random changes in allele frequency; occur naturally in every population, due to chance events\nSelection pressures Differentially selective environmental pressures; these can occur \nnaturally (random mating) or artificially (non-random mating)\nMutations A random change in the genetic composition of an organism due to alterations in the DNA base sequence. Mutations do not reshuffle alleles that are already present, but can produce completely new alleles\nThis section focuses on how mutations are a source of new alleles, and Section 9B examines \nhow allele frequencies can change in a population through gene flow, genetic drift and selection pressures.LINK9D EMERGENCE \nOF A NEW \nSPECIES\nPopulation \na group of individuals of the same species living in the same region at a given time\nSpecies \na group of organisms that can interbreed, producing fertile and viable offspring\nGene pool \nthe sum total of alleles present in a population of organisms\nAllele frequency \nthe proportion of a particular allele within a population\nFigure 9A\u20133 A gene pool is the sum total of \nalleles in a particular population.

How \nmany alleles for a specific trait are in the gene pool of this population?\n3 State the causes of variation in a population \u2013 that is, what causes allele frequencies to change in a population over time.\nIntroducing mutations\nDefining mutations\nDNA is usually stable; however, genetic material can change, especially when errors occur during DNA replication. When this change is permanent, it is called a \nmutation . An \norganism\u2019s DNA influences its structure, how it behaves, and its physiological processes. So changes to the nucleotide sequence of a section of DNA coding for a specific trait, a gene, can affect the structure and function of the protein it encodes. Therefore, mutations can create new versions of old alleles, which can cause significant variation between individuals. New alleles mean there will be changes in the allele frequencies of a population over time and this, you will recall, is the definition of evolution.\nMutations can be classified as somatic or germline.\n \u2022A somatic mutation occurs in a body cell of an organism and will only affect that \nindividual cell, so it is not passed on.\n \u2022A germline mutation occurs in a gamete and so is passed on to offspring. It is these mutations that have a role in the evolution of a population.Mutation \na permanent change in the nucleotide sequence of a section of DNA\nVIDEO 9A\u20132 \nMUTATIONS\n349 9A MUTATIONS\n",
  "Page 362": "Causes of mutations\nMutations can occur naturally or be induced.\n \u2022Spontaneous mutations are naturally occurring changes caused \nby errors in DNA replication. They create new alleles instantly.\n \u2022Induced mutations are caused by exposure to external elements. \nAgents known to cause mutations, like radiation sources (UV radiation, X-rays, nuclear radiation) and chemicals (benzene, pesticides, drugs), are called \nmutagenic agents . Induced \nmutations alter DNA at a slower rate than naturally occurring mutations.\nEffects of mutations\nThe effects of gene mutations can be beneficial, detrimental or neutral.\nTable 9A\u20132 Effects of gene mutations\nEffect Explanation\nBeneficial The mutation increases the organism\u2019s chance of survival and reproduction.Detrimental The mutation decreases the organism\u2019s chance of survival and reproduction.Neutral The mutation has no discernible effect on the organism\u2019s chance of survival \nand reproduction.\nPoint mutations\nDefining point mutations\nA point mutation  is a small, localised change to one base in the nucleotide sequence of a \ngene. Base substitutions may create silent, missense or nonsense mutations, while insertions \nand deletions cause frameshift mutations.\nRecall that genetic sequences are read in sets of three nucleotides. In DNA this is called \na triplet, and in messenger RNA a codon. These triplets code for specific amino acids, of which there are 20 different types. The genetic code is degenerate \u2013 that is, multiple codons code for the same amino acid. When the nucleotide sequence of a gene is altered, the triplets are altered, gene expression is altered and potentially so too is the production of a functional protein.\nSubstitution mutations\nA substitution mutation  occurs when a single nitrogenous base is replaced by a different base \nin the nucleotide sequence of a gene. There are three types of substitution mutations: silent, missense and nonsense (Table 9A\u20133).Figure 9A\u20135 Ultraviolet \nradiation can damage the DNA in a gene.\nLINK2B THE \nGENETIC CODE \nAND GENE \nEXPRESSION\nSubstitution \nmutation a type of point mutation that occurs when one nitrogenous base in a gene is replaced with another base; includes silent, missense and nonsense mutations\nTable 9A\u20133 Types of substitution mutationsPPS\nNo mutationSubstitution mutations\nSilent Missense Nonsense\nDNA TTT TTC TGT ATT\nmRNA AAA AAG ACA UAA\nAmino acid Lys Lys Thr STOPMutagenic agents agents known to cause mutations; for example, some radiation sources and chemicals; also called mutagens\nPoint mutation a change to one base in the nucleotide sequence of a section of DNA; includes base substitutions and frameshift mutations\n350\nCHAPTER 9 EVOLUTION: GENETIC CHANGES IN POPULATIONS OVER TIME\n",

Consequently, the protein structure and \nfunction remain the same. This is possible because the genetic code is degenerate. You can see in Table 9A\u20133 how, despite there being a substitution point mutation (TTT \u2192 TTC), the amino acid for that triplet remains lysine.\nMissense mutations\nA missense mutation  occurs when the base change in the nucleotide sequence of the \nDNA codes for a different amino acid. Consequently, the protein is still produced; however, the effect that this new amino acid has on the structure and function of the protein is uncertain. The effects can be minor or severe, depending on which amino acid is altered in the amino acid chain. As you can see in Table 9A\u20133, when there is a missense substitution point mutation (TT T \u2192 TGT), the amino acid for that triplet is \nchanged from lysine to threonine.\nFigure 9A\u20136 Sickle cell anaemia is a disorder caused by a substitution missense mutation.PPS\nFlows freely in blood vessels\nC T C\nG A G3\u00b4\n5\u00b45\u00b43\u00b4mRNA\nAmino acid sequence-\nnormal haemoglobinDNA template strand\nHaemoglobin\nNormal (globular)Normal haemoglobin\nGluNormal \nhaemoglobin\nG U GC A C\nHaemoglobin S\nClumped (\ufb01brous)Haemoglobin S (in sickle cell disease)\n3\u00b4\n5\u00b45\u00b43\u00b4mRNA\nAmino acid sequence-\nsickle cell haemoglobinDNA template stand\nForms clots in blood vesselsAbnormal \nhaemoglobin\nVal\nSilent mutation \na mutation where the change in the nucleotide sequence doesn\u2019t change the amino acid that is coded for\nMissense mutation a mutation in which the base change in the nucleotide sequence of the DNA changes the amino acid that is coded for; a type of substitution point mutation\n351 9A MUTATIONS\n",

Consequently, the production of the protein is prematurely halted \nor truncated. The impact of this change depends on the location of the mutation \u2013 if it is early in a gene, the effect will be greater than if the change is late in the gene.

This alters the codon reading frame and therefore affects every codon, and therefore every amino acid, beyond the point (downstream) of the mutation. This has a major effect on the resulting protein structure and function. Typically, frameshift mutations have more severe consequences than substitution mutations.

However, if errors occur during meiosis, when gametes are made, a gamete may be diploid, so at fertilisation the zygote ends up being polyploid. If one gamete is diploid, triploidy results (3n), and if both gametes are diploid, tetraploidy results (4n).\nThe polyploid organism will not be able to reproduce to create fertile and viable offspring \nunless it is able to mate with an individual that has the same chromosomal error, which is unlikely. Remember, to form offspring, pairs of chromosomes are needed, not odd numbers.

Inserting a nucleotide \nin the second triplet of the DNA template strand means the second amino acid will be affected. However, insertions and deletions of this sort (point mutation) cause a frameshift, and therefore the answer is D.\nTo prepare for questions that combine all these elements, ensure you can move forwards and backwards through the process of transcription and translation. For example, if provided with the amino acids, you should be able to work backwards to the template DNA to identify the mutation, and vice versa. Mutations are permanent changes to the nucleotide sequence of a section of DNA, so a question could ask about the change itself or about the consequences of the change.Question 27\nIn a mutation, the eighth nucleotide in this sequence was changed from C to T.What would be the result of this mutation?A\n The peptide chain would be shortened.\nB The third amino acid would change from Thr to Ile.\nC The fourth amino acid would change from Ile to Tyr.\nD There would be no change in the amino acid sequence.\nQuestion 28\nIn a different mutation, a T was inserted after the fourth nucleotide on the given \ntemplate strand.The result of this mutation would be thatA\n all amino acids in this entire sequence would change.\nB only the first amino acid in the sequence would change.\nC only the second amino acid in the sequence would change.\nD all amino acids after the first in the sequence would change.  \u00a9 VCAA 2007\n357 9A MUTATIONS\n",

This may be because the:\n \u2022mutation is in a non-coding DNA region (between genes or in a gene intron).\n \u2022mutation doesn\u2019t change the amino acid that is coded for\n \u2022change to the function of the gene or protein is not helpful or harmful.\nHowever, mutations can be a source of new alleles if they occur within or alter an exon of a gene, or affect the structure and function of a protein by altering the amino acid chain, or an entire gene. Therefore, mutations do have the potential to change allele frequencies in the gene pool of a population. However, they will only contribute to evolutionary change if the mutations occur in the genetic information of cells that\n \ncan be passed onto future generations \u2013 that is, in germline cells. Additionally, the organism must survive to maturity and reproduce, so the new allele can enter the next generation.\nWhat about the impact of mutations on genetic diversity? Recall the following dot point \nin the Study Design:\n \u2022Biological consequences of changing allele frequencies in terms of increased and decreased genetic diversity\nDo mutations cause an increase or decrease in genetic biodiversity? Genetic variation, or genetic diversity, is a measure of the range of genetic differences that exist within a population or within an entire species. This means a population with many different alleles for a single gene locus has a greater amount of genetic variation than a population in which there is only one possible allele at a single gene \nlocus. Therefore, if a mutation \ncreates a new allele, and this allele is inheritable, this will increase genetic diversity.VIDEO 9A\u20134  \nSKILLS: \nMUTATIONS, \nEVOLUTION \nAND GENETIC \nDIVERSITY \nLINK2B THE GENETIC \nCODE AND GENE \nEXPRESSION\nFigure 9A\u201312 The great diversity of Harmonia axyridis, commonly \ncalled the harlequin or Asian ladybeetle\n358\nCHAPTER 9 EVOLUTION: GENETIC CHANGES IN POPULATIONS OVER TIME\n",

They can accelerate faster than most sports cars but, sadly, they can\u2019t outrun the possibility of extinction.\nPressure from climate \nchange, hunting by humans, and habitat destruction are currently reducing their populations. But cheetahs also face problems as a consequence of their own genetic information \u2013 they have a low rate of reproductive success, meaning that as a species they are not always able to reproduce. However, this is not the first time in history that cheetahs have faced extinction. Genetic analysis of wild cheetahs shows that they have already survived at least two major catastrophic events, called bottleneck events. A bottleneck event occurs when, for example, a natural disaster dramatically reduces the size of a population. When this happens, as it did in the case of the cheetah, the few surviving individuals end up mating with relatives (inbreeding) and this reduces the genetic diversity of the population. Even though the size of the cheetah population in Africa had recovered to some degree by the 19\nth century, the cheetahs \nare almost all genetically identical and heavily inbred. When there is such low genetic diversity in a population, it is very difficult for the population to adapt to changes in their environment. If one individual is affected, all individuals are affected. As the population of wild cheetahs declines, only time will tell if they can survive the current genetic bottleneck.\nThis section explores how allele frequencies can change due to gene flow, genetic drift \nand environmental selection pressures (natural and artificial). The consequences for the genetic diversity of a population are also explored.\nFigure 9B\u20131 The fastest land animal could be facing \nextinction. Despite surviving two unpredictable events that dramatically decreased the size of the population, the cheetah is once again fighting for survival.\n360\nCHAPTER 9 EVOLUTION: GENETIC CHANGES IN POPULATIONS OVER TIME\n",
  "Page 373": "EXPLAIN\nChanging allele frequencies\nGene flow\nGene flow  is the exchange of genetic information, specifically alleles, between populations of \nthe same species. In animals, gene flow results from their movement into (immigration) or \nout of (emigration) a population. In plants, it results from the movement of seeds and pollen.\nWhen genes \u2018flow\u2019 from one population to another, that flow may increase genetic diversity \nof the gene pool of the receiving population, affecting the allele frequency. This may also decrease the variability between the two populations involved, making them more similar or homogenous.\nFigure 9B\u20132 When genes flow, the genetic diversity of the populations involved may change. With the movement \nof the \u2018a\u2019 allele from the left population into the right population, the allele frequencies of the receiving population will change and increase in diversity.PPS\nAAAAAAAA\naa\naa\naaaa\nGenetic drift\nYou have seen how allele frequencies can change as organisms move between populations, \nbut they also change randomly. This is called genetic drift . In genetic drift, no allele is \nfavoured; they are all equally subject to being affected.\nIn small populations, genetic drift can have a much more dramatic effect than in large \npopulations, as it can lead to a reduction in genetic diversity. As time progresses, alleles may be lost from the gene pool (frequency is 0%) or fixed as the only allele present for the gene (frequency is 100%). Larger populations are proportionately less affected by these unpredictable events and retain more stable allele frequencies.Gene flow \nthe exchange of genetic information, specifically alleles, between populations\nVIDEO 9B\u20131  \nCHANGES TO ALLELE FREQUENCY\nGenetic drift \na random change in allele frequency, occurring naturally in every population, due to chance eventsNOTE\nInterbreeding between the organism carrying an allele and a member of the population the \norganism is immigrating into, must also occur in order for this allele to become part of the  gene pool.\n361 9B EVOLVIN G AND NON -EVOLVI NG POPULA TIONS\n",
  "Page 374": "Events in the environment may \u2018magnify\u2019 genetic drift, by randomly killing a part of the \npopulation. Such events may be volcanic eruptions, landslides, floods and bushfires \u2013 but they also include the impact of disease, predators and so on. \nTake the population of goldfish in Figure 9B\u20133, where the frequency \nof the two alleles present is very different. Suppose a cat randomly \ncatches two fish, which happen to both have the genotype DD. \nThe frequency of each allele left in the population, D and d, \nis now equal. As the fish reproduce from now on, there will \nbe a change in the allele frequencies of the population \nover time, meaning that evolution is occurring.\nThere are two effects in genetic drift that may be \nsevere: the bottleneck effect and the founder effect.\nBottleneck effect\nIf a population is reduced to low numbers by an unpredictable and catastrophic event (natural or \nhuman-induced), there may be a severe reduction in the population\u2019s genetic diversity, which causes changes in the allele frequency of the gene pool, \nand thus the population is evolving. The population may recover and increase its numbers again, having squeezed through a \u2018bottleneck\u2019 of low numbers. However, as the surviving members of the species begin to repopulate, the allele frequencies of the new population are no longer representative of the original gene pool. This is called the \nbottleneck effect .\nThe smaller the population, the larger the impact that the bottleneck effect has. Alleles may be lost entirely after one natural disaster or may disappear after several generations of reproducing. Remember the cheetah, which has been through two bottleneck events. The first occurred around 100\n 000 \nyears ago and the second about 10  000 to \n12 000 years ago, at the end of the last ice \nage. As a consequence, many cheetahs are homozygous at a very high percentage of their gene loci; that is, there is less than 5% variation between members of the species. This puts the cheetah at high risk of extinction. When a population has low genetic diversity or variation, like the cheetah, it is less likely that there will be an allele that offers a survival advantage if selection pressures or the environment change.\nFounder effect\nThe founder effect  in genetic drift occurs when a small sample of the original population \nmoves away to colonise a new area and becomes isolated. The individuals in that small colony are unlikely to have the same allele frequencies that were in the original population\u2019s gene pool and so, as time passes and the population increases through interbreeding, the gene pool of the founder population will no longer represent the gene pool of the original population. Like the bottleneck effect, alleles in the founder population may be lost entirely, or with inbreeding occurring, may even disappear after several generations, thus reducing its genetic diversity.Figure 9B\u20133 Genetic drift is a change in the allele frequencies of \na population that occurs because of a random or chance event.\nDd Dd\nDd DdDD\nDD\nBottleneck effect \nwhen a population is drastically reduced to low numbers by a random or chance event and the allele frequencies of the surviving population do not reflect the genetic diversity of the original population\nFigure 9B\u20134 The impact of a bottleneck event \non population size is clear when represented in a graph.TimePopulation sizeBottleneck event\nExtinctionRecovery\nFounder effect \nwhen a small sample of a large population moves away to colonise a new area and becomes isolated; the allele frequencies of the founder population do not represent the genetic diversity of the larger original populationLINK 9A MUTATIONS\n362\nCHAPTER 9 EVOLUTION: GENETIC CHANGES IN POPULATIONS OVER TIME\n",

The conditions or factors that influence allele frequencies in a population in this way are known as \nselection \npressures . They are pressures that contribute to the selection of phenotypes that will be \nadvantageous in a given environment.

This variation is usually the consequence of a mutation. For example, a snails\u2019 shell colour does not matter until a new predatory bird moves into the area. The bird then becomes a selection pressure and the snails with shells that provide camouflage with their environment are at an advantage. These snails survive, as they are better suited to the environment, while other snails without well-camouflaged shells are less likely to survive. As you can see in this example, selection pressures can decrease the occurrence of a trait or increase the occurrence of a trait, but in both cases, there is the potential to change the allele frequencies of a population over time, thus causing evolution.\nSelection pressures can be natural environmental pressures (natural selection) or artificial \npressures brought about by humans through selective breeding or artificial selection.LINK 9A MUTATIONSSelection \npressures the conditions or factors that influence allele frequencies in a population by contributing to the selection of which phenotypes survive in a given environment, e.g. availability of resources, environmental conditions, predators and diseaseDOCWORKSHEET \n9B\u20131 THE \nGENE POOL \nAND RANDOM \nCHANGES TO \nTHE ALLELE \nFREQUENCY\nFigure 9B\u20137 A predatory bird is considered an example of a biotic selection pressure as it can \ninfluence the allele frequencies in a population of snails, by determining which shell phenotypes confer survival in a given environment.\n364\nCHAPTER 9 EVOLUTION: GENETIC CHANGES IN POPULATIONS OVER TIME\n",

However, this does not literally mean survival of the fittest organism \u2013 otherwise the cheetah would not be in so much trouble! Natural selection is the influence of selection pressures on the allele frequency of a population. It is the selection pressures that affect the survival of an individual in the population, but remember, this can only occur if there is already phenotypic variation in the population. That is, those individuals that are best suited to the environment or have a phenotype that offers a survival advantage (called a \nselective \nadvantage ) are more likely to survive, reproduce and pass on their favourable alleles to the \nnext generation.\nTherefore, due to natural selection, the frequency of alleles will change over generations, \ncausing evolution to occur. Beneficial phenotypes result in more offspring and therefore the responsible allele(s) are more likely to increase in frequency, while detrimental or less suitable phenotypes result in fewer offspring and hence the responsible allele(s) become less common in the gene pool. If there is a change in environmental conditions or selection pressures, those phenotypes that were once beneficial may no longer be, and thus the allele frequencies in a population are constantly evolving.Natural selection \nan evolutionary process whereby those individuals in a population that have a particular set of alleles are best suited to the environment and will survive, reproduce and pass on their genetic information to the next generation\nSelective advantage \na trait or phenotype that provides a survival advantage\nFigure 9B\u20138 Variation exists in the original population of these flies.

They first collect information on how the pathogen spreads and then use computers to determine the speed and distance of spread of the pathogen. However, when a pathogen mutates or evolves, the model has to be changed, as these variations are not taken into consideration by mathematical models.\nIn early 2020, researchers in Pennsylvania developed a mathematical theory that takes \nevolutionary changes into consideration. The researchers are hoping that, by including evolution in their modelling, they can better anticipate how a virulent pathogen strain may emerge. This would allow better decision making by the health officials and governments to prevent dangerous mutant pathogen strains from evolving further and spreading worldwide. Interestingly, their testing included using real-word networks like Twitter, where the spread of information was likened to the spread of disease.\nAn understanding of how pathogens evolve in the first place is therefore crucial. This \nsection builds on Sections 9A and 9B, and looks at how pathogens, specifically bacteria and viruses, can evolve. It also examines the challenges faced by the medical and pharmaceutical industries in the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by these evolving pathogens.\nFigure 9C\u20131 Mathematical modelling is used to predict the spread of a disease, and can now \ntake evolution into account. a Model showing a population of susceptible individuals (green circles) and a single infected individual (red hexagon). b The infection spreads and there is balance between infected individuals and those that have recovered (orange circles). c The pathogen in one individual mutates, creating a new strain (blue triangle).a b cLINK 9A MUTATIONS\nLINK9B EVOLVING \nAND NON-EVOLVING POPULATIONS\n371 9C APPROACH ES TO PATHOGE NIC EVOLUTION\n",

What does this have to do with the development of \nbacterial resistance ?\nRecall from Section 9A that mutations are the source of new alleles. A random mutation might cause some bacteria to become resistant to an antibiotic. Figure 9C\u20132 illustrates some of the ways that bacteria can demonstrate resistance to antibiotics. Bacteria only have one chromosome, and they have plasmids, but they only have one copy of each gene, so this means the impact of a mutation is immediate.LINK9B EVOLVING \nAND NON-\nEVOLVING \nPOPULATIONS\nLINK 9A MUTATIONS\nLINK9B EVOLVING \nAND NON-\nEVOLVING \nPOPULATIONSWhen treated with antibiotics, the resistant bacteria are selected for, as they have the survival advantage. They will survive, reproduce and pass on their alleles for resistance to the next generation. Those bacteria that are sensitive to the antibiotic will die, as they are selected against. This means resistant bacteria will flourish as there is no longer competition from the sensitive strains of bacteria. In this situation the antibiotic acts as the selection pressure. The allele responsible for the beneficial resistance phenotype will increase in frequency within the population. This is an example of natural selection.\nOver time, the whole population of bacteria becomes antibiotic resistant because the \nresistant strains are best suited to their environment.

  "Page 386": "Challenges for treatment strategies\nIncreasing numbers of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the population means that infections \nand diseases caused by such bacteria are becoming harder to control. It is increasingly difficult to find antibiotics that these strains of bacteria are not resistant to. Consequently, the effects of bacterial infections are becoming more severe, longer lasting and more expensive, and often result in death.\nRemember, where there is widespread use of antibiotics, such as in hospitals or on farms, \nresistance quickly spreads among different species of bacteria, by conjugation.\nMRSA, super bug\nStaphylococcus aureus, or golden staph, is a usually harmless bacterium that lives on the skin or in the nose. However, if it gets past one of the body\u2019s first lines of defence, it can cause a range of mild to severe infections. In the past, the antibiotic methicillin was used to treat these infections. However, at some point, bacterial strains arose that were resistant to this antibiotic. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is now resistant to most antibiotics, because of conjugation. It is for this reason that MRSA is called a superbug \u2013 it is almost impossible to\u00a0destroy.\nMRSA infections are especially prevalent in hospitals, where methicillin has been most \ncommonly used. Doctors now prescribe alternative antibiotics, like vancomycin, to treat infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.\nFigure 9C\u20135 Coloured scanning electron micrograph of \nMRSA in the process of being phagocytised by a human neutrophil\nThe search for new antibiotics\nThere is a constant race to find novel, or new, antibiotics as the number of resistant \nbacterial strains continues to rise. So why, then, has the discovery of new antibiotics slowed significantly over the past 20 years?\nThere are several reasons why finding novel antibiotics is so challenging. Researching, \ntesting, developing and running clinical trials of new antibiotics is expensive, and this reduces their appeal to the pharmaceutical industry. Even if a new, effective antibiotic is developed, the need to minimise exposure of bacteria to antibiotics in order to limit the development of resistance means the antibiotic will only be prescribed sparingly. This is, again, not an appealing prospect for the pharmaceutical industry. Additionally, the clinical life of any new antibiotic will be limited, as resistance to it inevitably develops.\nTo develop a novel antibiotic, pharmacologists need to:\n \u2022find a way to modify the chemical structure of an existing antibiotic so that a resistant \nbacterium will not be resistant to the altered form\n \u2022find new molecules that target bacterial biochemical pathways or cell structures that are different between bacteria and host, and work differently from antibiotics currently in use.\n374\nCHAPTER 9 EVOLUTION: GENETIC CHANGES IN POPULATIONS OVER TIME\n",
  "Page 387": "The search for alternatives to antibiotics\nScientists have also been looking at alternatives to antibiotics as a way of treating antibiotic-\nresistant bacteria. A tool that is emerging as particularly valuable in combating bacterial resistance by altering the allele for resistance, is CRISPR. The CRISPR-Cas9 system, as you will recall from Section 3D, is believed to be the cheapest, fastest and easiest-to-use form of genetic engineering. It has applications in gene editing, as described in Sections 3D and 5E, but researchers are discovering that it also has applications in detecting and altering bacterial resistance. The following box covers some of the current research into use of the CRISPR-Cas9 system to treat infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.LINK3D THE FUTURE \nOF GENOME EDITING\nUsing the CRISPR-Cas9 system\nOne new approach to using CRISPR-Cas9 is the \u2018pro-active\u2019 genetic system, or Pro-AG. This is a new CRISPR-based system that disables the gene that makes bacteria antibiotic resistant. It works by editing its targets rather than destroying them. This means the edited plasmid is still able to replicate and spread to other bacteria but is no longer able to produce antibiotic resistance.\nAnother novel approach is to program Cas9 to view itself as an enemy and therefore to \nmake cuts in its own genome. This is done by encoding a plasmid with instructions for CRISPR enzymes designed to disable Salmonella DNA. The plasmid is then placed inside E. coli bacteria and, through conjugation, the engineered plasmid is transferred from the E. coli to the Salmonella. The CRISPR system is then activated and destroys the Salmonella bacteria, leaving the E. coli undamaged. This highlights an advantage of CRISPR: it can be programmed to destroy only specific pathogenic bacteria and leave the other, healthy microbes untouched.\nThese new approaches are in the pre-clinical stages, but you can see how eventually there \nmay be a place for CRISPR-Cas9 in treating bacterial infections that do not respond to antibiotics.\nMinimising the development of resistance\nThere are many ways to try to minimise the development of bacterial resistance, such as:\n \u2022using antibiotics only when necessary (last resort) and appropriate (not for viral \ninfections)\n \u2022reducing the over-prescription of antibiotics by doctors\n \u2022using antibiotics that are specific to the infection (known as narrow spectrum) \u2014 this requires the antibiotic to be tested against the strain of the bacterium isolated from the infected person, so the most effective medication can be used\n \u2022ensuring that patients complete their course of antibiotics, so the bacteria are entirely destroyed\n \u2022ensuring that unused antibiotics are not kept for self-medication in the future or for someone else to use as they may not be appropriate for a future infection.LINK5E BIOTECHNO-\nLOGICAL APPLICATIONS OF BIOCHEMICAL PATHWAYS\nCheck-in questions \u2013 Set 2\n1 Suggest two reasons why bacterial resistance causes ongoing challenges for treatment \nstrategies.DOCWORKSHEET \n9C\u20131 BACTERIAL EVOLUTION AND THE CHALLENGES FOR TREATMENT\n375 9C APPROAC HES TO PATHOG ENIC  EVOLUTION\n",

Keep in mind that the ideas and concepts covered here can be applied to other viruses. Human influenza A viruses cause seasonal \nepidemics  (known as the flu season) almost every winter, and are also known to \ncause flu pandemics  (global epidemics).\nInfluenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on two glycoproteins on the surface of the virus: haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). There are many subtypes of haemagglutinin and many subtypes of neuraminidase. Each subtype is allocated a number (H1 to H18 and N1 to N11).\n \u2022 Haemagglutinin is an attachment protein that mediates entry of the virus into a host cell.\n \u2022 Neuraminidase is an enzyme that facilitates the release of the virus from the host cell after replication.\nRecall from Section 6A that the H and N surface proteins of influenza viruses are antigens, which means they are recognised by our immune system as non-self, and are capable of \ntriggering an adaptive immune response. Remember from Section 7D that an adaptive immune response means antibodies are produced, as well as B memory cells, which provide long-term immunity in case of subsequent exposure to the same pathogen (and antigen).LINK6C NON-\nCELLULAR \nPATHOGENS\nEpidemic \nthe rapid spread of an infectious disease to a large number of people within a population\nLINK6A RECOGNISING \nSELF FROM  \nNON-SELF\nFigure 9C\u20136 Generalised structure of an \ninfluenza A virus.

  "Page 389": "Antigenic drift\nThe RNA in the influenza virus is more prone to mutations than genes made of DNA. \nRecall that a mutation is a permanent change in the nucleotide sequence of a gene. This is due to the virus\u2019s replication machinery not having a \u2018proofreading\u2019 mechanism \u2013 that is, errors that occur are not corrected by enzymes, as they would be in DNA. Over time, mutations accumulate as they continually occur when the genetic material in the virus replicates. Many of the mutations that occur are random changes in a single nucleotide, or point mutations. When a mutation alters a gene coding for either or both of the surface proteins, the shape of these molecules changes. The specific antibodies created in response to a person having the flu in the past are now unable to recognise the shape of the viral antigens and bind to them. This process is known as antigenic drift.LINK 9A MUTATIONS\nFigure 9C\u20137 Antigenic drift: when an accumulation of mutations alters the gene \ncoding for the viral antigens (H and N), the shape of these molecules changes, making the virus less recognisable by the host cell\u2019s immune system.

You have seen how influenza viruses change all the time due to mutations or antigenic drift. Antigenic shift happens abruptly, less frequently than antigenic drift and at unpredictable intervals.\nAntigenic shift (gene reassortment) refers to the mixing of RNA in the virus genome, which \noccurs when several different viruses infect the same host cell at the same time. This shift typically occurs when a human flu virus crosses with a flu virus that usually affects animals (such as birds or pigs). In effect, influenza viruses have an enormous global pool of genetic material that can come together in different combinations, creating a major change in the virus. In this case, segments of their genetic material may recombine to produce viruses that have entirely new H or N surface proteins. Such animal-origin viruses can contain an H or H/N combination that is so different from the same subtype in humans that the antibodies made by the host\u2019s immune system in response to the previous subtypes don\u2019t recognise the new subtype, so a large portion of the human population is vulnerable to infection by the new strain. If this new virus causes illness in infected people, and can spread easily from person to person, an influenza pandemic can occur.LINK8A EMERGENCE, \nRE-EMERGENCE AND DISEASE CONTAINMENTLINK8A EMERGENCE, RE-EMERGENCE AND DISEASE CONTAINMENT\nLINK7D THIRD LINE OF DEFENCE\nPPS\n377 9C APPROAC HES TO PATHOG ENIC  EVOLUTION\n",

  "Page 392": "Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) have become the most commonly used antiviral \nmedication since the influenza virus developed resistance to the adamantane family of drugs, several years ago. Their mechanism of action is by preventing the liberation of the virions from the host cell, shown in Figure 9C\u20139, is only effective if they are administered in the first 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. During the 2007\u20132009 influenza seasons worldwide, a virus strain emerged that was naturally resistant to NAI treatment. A mutation had changed the genetic code in the virus, resulting in an amino acid substitution in the neuraminidase enzyme. Consequently, the shape of the NAI was no longer complementary to the enzyme active site, allowing the influenza viruses to evade the action of NAIs. This is an example of antigenic drift. Given the frequency at which antigenic drift occurs in the influenza A virus, it is best to have as many options as possible for treating influenza infections.\nTo combat future influenza virus epidemics (evolution due to antigenic drift) and even \npandemics (evolution due to antigenic shift) we need medication that can replace or work in combination with the NAIs. A number of drugs that act on different targets than those of the NAIs are being researched and tested, and these are summarised in Table 9C\u20132. \nTable 9C\u20132 Antiviral medications currently being developed.\nActs on virus or \nhost cell?Mechanism of action NameFigure 9C\u20139 reference\nVirus Targets viral RNA polymerase, which is involved in RNA replication within the host cellFavipiravir Trial drug 1\nBlocks maturation of the viral H surface protein at the post-translational stageNitazoxanide Trial drug 2\nHost cell (epithelium of the respiratory tract)Cleaves sialic acid receptors from the host cells to inhibit virus entryFludase Trial drug 3\nCompared to the NAIs, these novel drugs are expected to have a longer clinical life, making \nthem more effective in the long term. Those that act on the host cell have the added benefit of being even less likely to encourage drug resistance.\nOne ongoing challenge in the design of novel antiviral medication is to ensure that the drug \ntargets a process or structure that is unique to the virus. Recall that viruses use the host cells to multiply, so it is hard to destroy viruses without killing the host cells as well. This is increasingly difficult because of the ever-changing nature of the virus\u2019s structure, due to their evolution. In addition to this, there is great diversity among viruses \u2013 some have DNA, others have RNA \u2013 and it is therefore unlikely that a broad-spectrum antiviral drug can be created.\nTo manage the evolution of viruses and reduce the likely development of resistant virus \nstrains, scientists are also researching and testing:\n \u2022treatments that involve the delivery of a combination of antivirals, each acting on a different aspect of the influenza virus\u2019s life cycle\n \u2022a possible role for CRISPR in the treatment of viral infections (see the \u2018Using CRISPR\u2019 box).NOTE\nYou do not need to know the names of these novel medications.

  "Page 393": "Vaccination\nIn Section 7D you learnt about the third line of defence and the important roles that \nantibodies play in defending against pathogens once they have entered our body. In Section 7E you saw how antibodies can be artificially induced through vaccinations to prevent viral infections. This means that people who have been vaccinated against the flu will be less likely to display symptoms if exposed to the same strain of influenza they were vaccinated against. But we now know that viruses evolve, so what does this mean for the success of vaccinations as a preventative measure for viral infections?\nAs mentioned earlier, you can get sick from the seasonal flu every year even though you\u2019ve \nhad it before \u2013 this is because of antigenic drift. Every year, a slightly different version of the virus emerges. This means that every time the virus evolves, the vaccine for influenza A must be updated so that the antibodies it induces are specific to the antigens of the new strains.\nCurrently, researchers predict which flu viruses are likely to cause a problem in the \nupcoming flu season and then make seasonal influenza vaccines. In Australia, the flu vaccines released to the public are usually quadrivalent; that is, they contain four viral strains. Scientists know that influenza viruses evolve and possibly will do so before the flu season begins, so by including four strains they hope that at least one strain will be similar enough to the evolving virus to give some protection.\nFinding a universal vaccine, one that will be successful no matter what virus is being \ntargeted, is the challenge of defending against evolving viruses. One way of finding a universal vaccine is to target a conserved area of the virus \u2013 this is an area of its structure that doesn\u2019t change despite antigenic drift and shift. Haemagglutinins, or H surface proteins, have two regions: a head domain and a stem (or stalk) domain (Figure 9C\u201310). Traditionally, vaccines are based on producing antibodies in the host organism that can target and neutralise the head domain, which is the part required for cell attachment. However, the head domain is highly variable between strains of influenza, and is the domain that experiences more mutations.Using CRISPR\nThe CRISPR-Cas9 system, you will recall, has potential applications in detecting and \naltering bacterial resistance. The specificity of CRISPR is also appealing to researchers who are looking to target pathogenic viruses. It is a logical progression to take a tool that cuts up viruses from a bacterium (CRISPR), where it exists naturally, and use it to treat viral infections in humans. Scientists have shown that Cas13, another CRISPR enzyme, can be programmed to damage the viral genome of the influenza A virus, so much so that it can no longer infect new cells.\nThe advantage of CRISPR is that, if a virus evolves, it is comparatively easy to change the \nCRISPR system to keep up with whatever the virus is doing. CRISPR antiviral medications are still in development, but they have shown early signs of success in the laboratory and also promise to be cost effective.\nLINK7E ACTIVE \nAND PASSIVE IMMUNITYLINK7D THIRD LINE OF DEFENCE\nFigure 9C\u201310 To make a universal influenza virus vaccine, the regions of \nthe virus that are targeted need to be those that remain the same, or do not evolve often, such as the stem or stalk of the H surface protein and the M2 protein.M2 ion\nchannelN surface\nprotein\nH surfaceproteinHead domain (variable)\nStem or stalk domain(conserved)\n381 9C APPROAC HES TO PATHOG ENIC  EVOLUTION\n",

So your job is to read relevant articles and practice making links between what you read and what you have learnt in class. In this way, if new information appears in an assessment situation, you will feel comfortable with it.\nAn example of current research into the treatment of pathogens is in the area of phage\n \ntherapy. This was referred to in the VCAA 2019 examination when describing how \nbacterial resistance causes ongoing challenges in the treatment of bacteria (discussed in Section 9C). The question related specifically to the treatment of bacterial infections. Read the following information summarised from news reports, and see how links can be made from the published research and the content you have covered in Biology.\nPhage therapyBacteriophages, or phages, are viruses that infect and kill bacterial cells. The therapeutic \nuse of bacteriophages in treating bacterial infections, called phage therapy, was first trialled close to a century ago. Phage therapy showed some success clinically, but as soon as antibiotics entered the picture, phage therapy research was put aside. Now, with the rise of antibiotic resistance, interest in phage therapy has been reignited in the search for alternatives to antibiotics. Despite the appeal of phage therapy, the gaps in scientists\u2019 understanding must be filled before phage therapy can be tested clinically and used in mainstream medicine.Advantages of phage therapy compared to antibiotics:\n \u2022Phages have a higher level of host specificity.\n \u2022The cost of development is lower.\n \u2022There are fewer known side effects (so far).\n \u2022Phages have been more successful at treating multi-drug resistant bacteria.\n \u2022There are many more types of phage than there are bacteria, so there are a wider range of possibilities.\nIn addition to this, DNA technologies, such as genetic engineering, CRISPR and genome sequencing, will allow phages to be matched for their specific bacteria-killing properties. An important consideration for phage therapy is whether there is any possibility of bacterial resistance developing.\nHopefully you can see from the above information that there are links to many aspects of \nthis course: viruses, bacteria, bacterial infections, treatment using antibiotics, antibiotic resistance, specificity, genetic engineering and CRISPR.\nFigure 9C\u201311 Generalised structure of a \nbacteriophage, a virus that infects and kills bacteriaHead DNA\nTail sheath\nTail fibreVIDEO 9C\u20134  \nSKILLS: PHAGE THERAPY\n383 9C APPROAC HES TO PATHOG ENIC  EVOLUTION\n",

Sometimes, these changes can result in the development of a new species.\nIt is well accepted that the development of new species involves natural selection, but \nscientists have found that, in the case of stick insects, the right scent is just as crucial. Research has shown that stick insects in different populations and species were unwilling to interbreed because of the scent of the chemicals on the insects\u2019 exterior. These chemicals prevent the stick insects from drying out but also play an important role in \u2018signalling\u2019 to attract suitable mates. The populations that were not mating differed most in their chemical profiles and their genetic make-up. This led the researchers to conclude that the insects\u2019 perfume acted as a barrier that prevented the different populations from interbreeding and mixing their genetic information. Over time this led to the development of a new species.\nIn this section we will explore the evolutionary process of forming a new species, and \nconsider the examples specified in the Study Design.\nFigure 9D\u20131 Over two decades, researchers in three countries \ninvestigated 100 populations of stick insects, including 11 species.

  "Page 399": "EXPLAIN\nSpeciation\nRecall from Section 9A that members of a species have similar structural features, and are \nable to interbreed and produce fertile  and viable  offspring in their natural environment. \nSpeciation  is the creation of new species from the previously existing, or ancestral, species. \nThis process occurs when a population is divided in some way and, over time, because the sub-populations are isolated from each other, genetic differences accumulate.\nFor speciation to occur, the division in the population must prevent the sub-populations \nfrom successfully interbreeding \u2013 that is, the sub-populations must be \nreproductively \nisolated . This also means the sub-populations are genetically isolated, so there is no gene \nflow between the groups. There are different reasons why groups of organisms may be unable to interbreed and produce offspring. For example, it may be that two sub-populations of the same species reproduce at different times of the year, or have developed different mating rituals.\nTwo basic mechanisms through which speciation can occur are:\n \u2022allopatric speciation , where a geographical barrier divides the ancestral population\n \u2022sympatric speciation , where no geographical barrier is involved.Fertile \nable to reproduce\nViable \nable to survive\nSpeciation \nthe evolutionary process of forming a new species from a pre-existing ancestral species\nReproductive \nisolation the inability of two groups of organisms to interbreed successfully; genetic isolation also ensures there is no gene flow between the two populations\nAllopatric \nspeciation a form of speciation that occurs when a geographical barrier physically divides a population; the two sub-populations accumulate so many genetic differences that they become reproductively isolated and are considered different species\nSympatric \nspeciation a form of speciation that occurs without the involvement of a physical barrier; often occurs in plants as a consequence of polyploidy\nFigure 9D\u20132 Speciation, or the formation of a new species from an existing species, can  \noccur by allopatric speciation or sympatric speciation.\nAllopatric speciationAncestral population\nSympatric speciation\nVIDEO 9D\u20131  \nSPECIATION\nLINK 9A MUTATIONS\nPPS\nCheck-in questions \u2013 Set 1\n1 Define fertile, viable and speciation.\n387 9D EMERGEN CE OF A NEW  SPECIES\n",

The term comes from allo- meaning \u2018other\u2019, and -patric meaning \u2018place\u2019. The steps in the process of allopatric speciation (Figure 9D\u20133) are as follows:1\n Begins with an interbreeding ancestral population of one species that naturally contains variation.\n2\n A geographical or physical barrier separates a population into two. For example, the barrier may be a mountain, a desert forming, a river changing course or a freeway going through a forest.\n3\n The two populations are reproductively isolated, so there is no gene flow between them.\n4 Different mutations may arise randomly in the two populations or be pre-existing.\n5 Selection pressures on either side of the barrier may be different. Therefore, different phenotypes will be at a selective advantage as natural selection occurs.\n6\n Mutations also arise that affect the ability of individuals to reproduce. The allele frequencies of each population change as the two populations evolve in different ways.\n7\n Eventually, the accumulated genetic changes in the two gene pools prevent the formation of fertile and viable offspring if the two populations were brought back together.

Originally there was just one ancestral species of finch that colonised the islands from mainland South America: a ground-dwelling, seed-eating finch. However, as the finches on different islands were geographically isolated from each other by the ocean, over millions of years, the ancestral finch species evolved into many different species. At least 15 species developed: some species are ground-dwelling seed-eaters; some live on cactuses, eating seeds; some live in trees, eating seeds; and some species are tree-dwelling insect-eaters. Each species of finch has a uniquely shaped beak, because individuals with that beak shape have a selective advantage in that particular environment. Therefore, they survive and are able to reproduce, resulting in viable and fertile offspring. For example, finches that have large blunt beaks can crack open the hard exterior of nuts and seeds that grow on trees, while finches with long thin beaks can get their beaks all the way into cactus flowers to get the nectar.

  "Page 402": "Sympatric speciation \nSympatric speciation occurs when new species are formed from an ancestral species within \nthe same location \u2013 that is, without the involvement of a geographical or physical barrier. For this reason, it is sometimes thought of as being the opposite of allopatric speciation. The term comes from sym- meaning \u2018same\u2019, and -patric meaning \u2018place\u2019. Sympatric speciation is rare, and it is difficult to tell whether it has occurred. However, it has been seen in a range of organisms, including plants, bacteria, cichlid fish and the apple maggot fly.\nHow could a population \nbecome reproductively isolated and reduce gene flow without the involvement of a physical barrier? Why do the members of the population stop interbreeding when they still live in the same environment? How can the population possibly speciate? There are several ways that sympatric speciation can occur, but the most common occurs in plants, when there is reproductive isolation because of genetic abnormalities. For example, if a non-disjunction mutation results in a polyploid individual, as you saw is possible (in Section 9A), the affected individual will not be able to reproduce and create fertile and viable offspring with \nindividuals that do not have the same chromosomal error. This is because reproduction with an individual from the normal, non-mutated original parent population results in offspring with an uneven number of chromosomes.\nThis is why sympatric speciation is more common in plants \nthan in animals, because it is easier for plants to self-fertilise (asexual reproduction) than it is for animals. A tetraploid (4 n) \nplant cannot successfully produce offspring with a diploid (2n) plant (Figure 9D\u20136), but a tetraploid plant can self-fertilise to create offspring.\nSympatric speciation can also occur in other ways, although, \nas mentioned earlier (e.g. stick insects and scent), these are uncommon. For example, it may occur if members of a population use different resources or niches within the same geographical location or have mismatched reproductive organs or timings, or different mating dances. The following example, looking at Howea palms, will help you understand how sympatric speciation occurs in this situation.\nExample: Howea palms\nLord Howe Island is a small volcanic island in the Tasman Sea, approximately 700 km north-east of Sydney. It was formed some 6.9 million years ago, and it has a subtropical climate, rocky peaks, a volcano crater and densely vegetated lower ground.\nIt is home to four species of palm trees, two of which, Howea forsteriana and Howea \nbelmoreana, provide an example of sympatric speciation. These palms are found nowhere \nelse in the world; they are endemic to Lord Howe island.

This species grew in neutral and acidic soils on the island.\nEventually, some seeds of the ancestral \npalm must have germinated in the more calcareous soils. Growing in calcarenite soils is stressful for the plant, as these soils have a high pH (alkaline) and contain few nutrients. This physiological stress has been shown to affect flowering time. Therefore, these trees were unable to pollinate, or be pollinated by, the trees growing in volcanic soils as their reproductive cycles were different. They became reproductively isolated and gene flow could not occur between the two palms. Over time, the different selection pressures acting on them resulted in phenotypic differences and each became better adapted to growing in the alkaline or calcareous soil. Eventually, the accumulated genetic changes in the two gene pools prevented the formation of fertile and viable offspring when the two populations were brought back together. They therefore remain reproductively isolated and are now two distinct species (Figure 9D\u20137).\n1.

  "Page 414": "HOW DOES LIFE CHANGE AND RESPOND TO \nCHALLENGES?\nIntroduction\nIn this chapter you will take a trip back in time through the 4.5 billion year history of Earth. \nWe examine the development of life through the eras and periods of geological time, from the emergence of the first primitive life forms in deep ocean vents, to the wide biodiversity on our planet today.\nFossil evidence has played an essential role in developing scientific understanding of life that has \ncome before us. New discoveries help us to build a more complete image of how life was shaped, in some cases adding to what we already know but often challenging existing ideas about how all the pieces of life fit together. In this chapter you will explore many different types of fossils, including \u2018transitional fossils\u2019, and how they have helped scientists make connections from one species to the next. The process of fossilisation is explained, along with the various techniques used to date fossils and the rocks they are found in.\nThe types of evidence that are collected and analysed by scientists to determine the evolutionary \nrelationships between species are investigated. Recent advances in technology have enabled scientists to analyse evidence at a molecular level, in addition to the structural and anatomical evidence (often from fossils) that they have relied on in the past. Finally, you will develop an understanding of how this evidence is used to create diagrams known as phylogenetic trees, which can be interpreted to trace the ancestry of not only all current life forms, but those that have come and gone in the millions of years before us.UNIT \n4 \nEVOLUTION OVER TIMECHAPTER \n10\n402\n",

While this doesn\u2019t seem like much, the accumulation of this movement over the past few years now means that Australia is \u2018out of sync\u2019 with GPS and has resulted in the government formally requesting that our country\u2019s longitude and latitude be updated to reflect our new position. This movement of our country is due to the action of tectonic plates, pieces of Earth\u2019s crust, on which all the planet\u2019s continents rest. While all continents are showing signs of movement or \u2018drift\u2019, the plate that Australia rests on is moving considerably faster than any other plate.\nPlanet Earth consists of four layers: \ninner core, outer core, mantle and crust (Figure 10A\u20131). The crust is broken into seven large pieces (and a few smaller ones) that glide over the mantle below it. The movement of these plates over the mantle is referred to as \nplate tectonics  \nand it is this process that explains the movement of planet Earth\u2019s continents throughout geological time. Plate tectonics is also responsible for the formation of the landscapes that we see today. From mountain ranges to valleys, volcanoes to deep ocean trenches, all these natural wonders are the result of tectonic plate interactions.\nIt is now widely accepted that approximately 1 billion years ago, all the modern-day \ncontinents were joined, in a supercontinent known as Rodinia. Since then the planet\u2019s land masses have assembled into different arrangements (Figure 10A\u20132).\nCrust\n0\u201360 km\nMantle\n60\u20132890 km\nOuter core\n2890\u20135150 km\nInner core\n5150\u20136360 km\nFigure 10A\u20131 The four layers of Earth.

With plate tectonics continuing to drive the movement of today\u2019s continents towards each other, scientists believe another supercontinent is only a matter of time away.

This time scale was developed in the 19th century, when geologists observed that particular rocks were characterised by similar types of fossils. The \ngeological time scale  acts like a calendar \ndepicting the key changes in Earth\u2019s biodiversity  over time. It is used by scientists to describe \nthe timing and relationships between the key events that have led life to where it stands today.

While the emergence of a new fossil discovery may sometimes provide the missing piece of the puzzle, it can also add another layer of complexity that causes us to redefine what we already know, making the geological time scale a \u2018moving target\u2019.\nFor this reason, it is important to understand that the end-of-year examination will \nassess your ability to apply the geological time scale, rather than memorise it. The key points below provide a summary of the information you will need to know in order to successfully answer questions on this topic.\n1 \n How the geological time scale is organised\nIt is important that you know that the time scale is divided into eras and periods. \nWhile you do not need to memorise dates, you should be able to recognise the names of the eras that the time scale has been divided into, and know what types of organisms appeared before others in the evolution of life on Earth.\n2 \n What the geological time scale represents\nThe geological time scale is a calendar that gives a visual summary of key chronological \nevents throughout Earth\u2019s history. The fossil record shows that significant changes in biodiversity have occurred, and the order in which new species appeared (and disappeared), and is highly organised rather than random. Each era of the time scale represents a significant change in the Earth\u2019s biodiversity at the time, with the appearance of new dominant groups.\nFor example, the change from the Mesozoic era to the Cenozoic era saw the loss of the \ndinosaurs (Mesozoic) and the emergence of mammals (C\nenozoic).\n3  The consequences of change\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, you need to be able to apply your knowledge to \nexplain the significance of change. This change might be a change in the environment or a change in the behaviour or structure of an organism. Here are two examples of the types of questions you could be asked:\n \u2022Explain the significance of the build-up of oxygen in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere in terms of \nbiodiversity.\n \u2022Early invertebrates are believed to have temporarily left the water to lay their eggs on land. Why would this behaviour have been advantageous for the invertebrates?\nThe summary diagram of the geological time scale (Figure 10A\u201334) is a useful way of making connections between all the key events that have occurred.

Using heavy-duty \nequipment, he was digging as he had done a thousand times before, unaware that he was about to make one of the most remarkable discoveries that science had ever seen.\nAs he excavated the layers of dirt beneath him, Shawn stumbled across an unusual \nassortment of rocks. Closer inspection of these rocks showed an intricate pattern of detail. What Shawn didn\u2019t realise at the time was that he had just found a 110 million year old nodosaur preserved in the best condition of any dinosaur fossil on record. While most animal fossil discoveries consist of bones and the occasional tooth, this nodosaur fossil was so complete that it was more like a life-like statue than the fossilised remains of an ancient dinosaur.\nFigure 10B\u20131 A front view of the nodosaur fossil. The fossil is so life-like that the dinosaur \nappears to be sleeping. Scientists believe that the nodosaur was fossilised whole, but only its front half was stable enough to be recovered.\n424\nCHAPTER 10 EVOLUTION OVER TIME\n",
  "Page 437": "EXPLAIN\nTypes of fossils\nFossils  are the remains or traces of a pre-existing life form. They come in a range of \nsizes and types and are generally formed from the hard parts (shells, bones, teeth) of an \norganism. As new fossil evidence is found, it is added to the fossil record. The fossil record  \nis a system that tracks all the changes in Earth\u2019s biodiversity over time. The geological time scale that you read about in Section 10A has been built according to fossil record evidence.\nCurrently the oldest known fossil on record is of bacteria dated at over 4 billion years \nold. Despite the current fossil record being extensive, it still has many gaps, which \npalaeontologists  hope to fill with new finds in the future.To remove the nodosaur from its rocky tomb, museum experts spent days chipping away at the rock, until it was ready to be hoisted out of the ground. However, removing the 7000 kg slab rock that contained the dinosaur did not go to plan. As the rock emerged from the ground, it shattered, splitting the nodosaur into pieces. Eventually, the team were able to safely transfer the front half (snout to hips) of the nodosaur to the museum\u2019s workstation, where recovery continued over the next five years.\nThe reward for this painstakingly delicate project is a true-to-life dinosaur that looks as \nif it had walked Earth just weeks ago. From the scales on the skin that covered its bony armour, to the tendons that helped support the nodosaur\u2019s tail, the detail captured in its stone-like state is extraordinary. Finds like this not only help us learn more about Earth\u2019s prehistoric times, they also motivate us to continue searching for clues, as we wonder what else is out there, just waiting to be stumbled upon.\nFigure 10B\u20132 Artist\u2019s impression of a \nnodosaur.

Common examples are footprints, bite marks, burrows, eggs and coprolites (faeces).\nFigure 10B\u20134 Trace fossils: coprolite (left), dinosaur tracks (middle) and dinosaur eggs (right)\nTrace fossils are useful for determining the behavioural patterns of animals. In many cases, trace fossil evidence pre-dates evidence of the organism itself, giving scientists knowledge of life that may never be found directly. For example, one of the earliest body fossil finds that shows our human ancestors walked on two legs has been dated at 3.2 million years old. However, trace fossils of footprints making their way across volcanic ash have been dated at 3.75 million years old, which shows that our ancestors walked on two legs much earlier than suggested by the body fossil that was found.\nFossil formation\nFossilisation is the process that results in the preservation of the hardened remains or traces of organisms. The process usually occurs in \nsedimentary rock , due to the layering effect that \nforms this type of rock, although fossils have occasionally been found in metamorphic rocks .\nFigure 10B\u20135 shows the typical fossilisation process.LINK11A \nCLASSIFICATION AND CHARACTERISTICS OF MODERN HUMANS\nSedimentary rock  \na type of rock \nthat is formed from the accumulation of sediment into layers\nMetamorphic \nrock a type of rock that arises from the transformation of existing rocks\nStep 1: An organism\ndies and the body orpart of the body israpidly buried insediment, or incolder environments,e.g.  snow and ice.\nStep 3: Chemical changes occur as theoriginal hard parts become porous, allowingminerals from the surrounding sediment toseep in and replace them to form the fossil.As successive layers of sediment continue tobuild up, the sediment is hardened into rockby heat and pressure, preserving theevidence of life inside it.

This type of fossil contains features in common with the ancestral group it has arisen from, and with its descendants, making it an intermediate between the two.\nTwo well-known examples of transitional fossils are explained below.\nArchaeopteryx: reptiles to birds\nArchaeopteryx, discovered in 1861, is \na transitional fossil believed to be the evolutionary link between reptiles and birds. Fossil evidence has shown that this species had traits in common with both dinosaurs and birds, which led scientists to place it as the intermediate form between these two very different groups.\nIn common with the theropod dinosaurs \nwere Archaeopteryx\u2019s long bony tail, jaws lined with sharp teeth, sharp claws for grasping prey and, most importantly, a furcula or fused clavicle (wishbone), which is only found in birds and some theropod dinosaurs, providing evidence of the relationship between the two.\nUnlike dinosaurs, Archaeopteryx also had \nfeathers that were structured for flight, as well as wings that allowed it to fly for short \nperiods. These features resemble those of modern birds.\nFigure 10B\u20136 Archaeopteryx fossil.

Fossil evidence of Tiktaalik has shown the presence of early wrist and finger bones that would have assisted it to prop itself up in shallow waters.

Name two other \nconditions that must occur for a fossil to form.\n5  Explain the significance of transitional fossils in the study of evolution.\nDating of fossils\nKnowing when an organism lived plays an important part in the reliable construction of our evolutionary family tree. Accurate dating techniques allow scientists to place evidence into the fossil record with precision, which is necessary to create accurate sequences of evolutionary change over time.\nThere are two methods scientists can use to date fossils: they can date the fossil directly \n(\nabsolute dating ), or they can analyse the rock samples that the specimen is found in, to \ndetermine its age ( relative dating ).\nRelative dating\nRelative dating of fossils and/or their surrounding rocks occurs when the specimen is compared to another sample of known age. For example, if you were to find an ammonite on the rock shores of an area that was already known to be around 150 million years old, you could use this information to estimate that your ammonite fossil is also approximately 150 million years old. The basis for this method of dating comes from a branch of science known as \nstratigraphy .\nAs you read earlier, fossils are almost exclusively found in a type of rock known as sedimentary rock. Sedimentary rock is formed through a layering effect in which multiple layers of sediment (strata) are laid down on top each other. As the layers accumulate, increasing pressure and compression over time lead to the production of sedimentary rock.Absolute dating \ndetermines the actual age of the specimen being analysed\nRelative dating \ndetermines the age of a specimen by comparing its placement with that of other fossils or the rock layers it is found in\nStratigraphy a branch of geology that uses the \u2018principle of rock succession\u2019 to examine the order and position of strata in connection with fossilised remains\nFigure 10B\u20139 The strata in this sedimentary rock wall are \nclearly indicated through the layers of colour throughout.E\nYoungest\nstratum\nABCD\nOldest stratum\nFigure 10B\u201310 The principle of rock succession \nstates that the layers towards the bottom are older than the layers towards the top.\n430\nCHAPTER 10 EVOLUTION OVER TIME\n",

From this, we can conclude that each layer is younger than the one below it, and older than the one on top of it. This rule also applies to any fossils that are contained within the layers of rock.\nIndex fossils\nLike rock layers, fossils do not appear randomly. Rather, they follow each other through time in a regular and predictable pattern. For this reason, some types of fossils can be used as a tool for determining the age of samples. We call these \nindex fossils .\nIndex fossils are known to have occurred during a very specific time frame. They also have a wide geographical distribution, which means they are commonly found in many parts of  the world.

The presence of index fossils in rock strata, even those at different sites, separated by large geographical distances, can be used to infer that the strata are of the same approximate age.\nThe layers with the same index fossil present can be \ndetermined as being approximately the same age\nregardless of their position at each site.

The concept of half-lives and their use in radiometric dating is explored further in the 10B Skills section.\nScientists use a range of isotopes when calculating the absolute age of a sample.

Explain.\n10B SKILLS\nUsing half-life graphs to determine ageA typical way of presenting data that relates to absolute dating and half-life is as a graph. Figure 10B\u201315 shows a general representation of the radioactive decay of an unstable parent isotope into its stable daughter isotope.\nAs you can see from the graph, after one half-life has passed, 50% of the parent isotope \nhas been replaced by the daughter isotope and there is now a 50\n : 50 ratio of each isotope \npresent within the sample.\nIt is important to note that, after a second half-life, the parent isotope does not \ndisappear completely to be replaced entirely by the daughter isotope. Rather, the 50% that remained after the first half-life is reduced by half again, leaving 25% of the parent isotope (and 75% of the daughter isotope) in the sample.\nAfter a third half-life, the remaining 25% of parent isotope\n is halved again, leaving 12.5% \nof the parent isotope, with the rest made up of the daughter isotope.This process continues as the years progress, with the passing of each half-life \nresulting in the loss of another half of the remaining parent isotope.

While the analysis of structural similarities and differences is useful in comparing \nmodern species, more importantly, it has provided a means for scientists to make connections between today\u2019s biodiversity and extinct ancestral species.\nStructural evidence in the fossil record has assisted scientists to assemble an evolutionary \ntimeline of how life on Earth has progressed over billions of years. Remember Archaeopteryx, the transitional fossil discussed in Section 10B? Or from Section 10A, Tiktaalik, the ancestral fish that moved onto land? It was the structural features preserved in the fossilised remains of these animals that allowed scientists to make the link between dinosaurs and birds, and the progression of life from water to land.\nHomologous structures\nTake a look at the animals in Figure 10C\u20132. At first glance, they do not appear to\u00a0have much in common. They look different and so do the environments they occupy.\nWhile outwardly these animals do not appear to have any similarities, if you take a \ncloser look at their internal environment, you will see similarities in their bone structure (Figure\u00a010C\u20133). We call these similar structures \nhomologous structures  because, while they \nmay perform different functions according to the needs of the organism, they are similar in structure. The pentadactyl limb is a good example. Homologous structures can be seen in a range of organisms that share a recent common ancestor.

With the development of techniques that can sequence DNA and proteins, we can now compare species at a molecular level. This is particularly useful when the species of interest have no structural similarities (for example, a kangaroo and a eucalyptus tree). Structural morphology techniques would be of little use in determining the relationship between these two species, but because DNA is universal, DNA and the proteins of an organism can be analysed to determine their degree of relatedness\nThe use of \nmolecular homology  in determining species relatedness can be described as a \n\u2018molecular clock\u2019. This \u2018clock\u2019 is based on two fundamental ideas:\n1 The greater the similarily in the DNA or amino acid sequences between the species, the less time that has passed, and therefore the more recently these species shared a common ancestor.\n2\n The greater the differences in these sequences between species, the more time that has elapsed for these changes to accumulate and, hence, the further back in time a common ancestor was shared.\nComparing DNA sequences\nAll organisms contain DNA. This means that all organisms, both extinct and present-day, are descended from a common ancestor. By comparing the DNA of different species, we can determine how recently (or long ago) the common ancestor was shared.\nRecall that DNA is made up of the repetitive linkage of nucleotides, with each nucleotide \nconsisting of a nitrogenous base. When conducting DNA analysis to determine relatedness, the sequence of bases between the two (or more) species is compared, to identify similarities and differences. The greater the degree of similarity, the more recently the species shared a common ancestor.\nFigure 10C\u20137 compares a DNA sequence for part of a gene found in humans, rats and mice.Molecular \nhomology the analysis of DNA and amino acid sequences as evidence of evolutionary relationships\nLINK2A NUCLEIC \nACIDS\nCCAATGGGGCGGGGGCGCTGGGGCTC ACCA TATAAGGAGCGGCCTCGCCATAAAAGGAAACATTGTA TCTCTTT ATA\nCCAATGGGGCGGGGGCGCTGGGGCTC GCCA TATAAGGAGCGGCCTCGCCATAAAAGGAAACATTGTA TCTCTTT ATA\nCCAATGGGGCGGGGGCGCTGGGGCTCGCCA TATAAGGAGCGGCCTCGCCATAAAAGGAAACATTGTA TCTCTTT ATAHuman\nRat\nMouse\nFigure 10C\u20137 A comparison of human, rat and mouse DNA for a common gene\nFrom this information, it can be seen that there is no difference in bases between the rat \nand the mouse for this part of the gene.

  "Page 457": "Mitochondrial DNA\nMost of the DNA within a eukaryotic cell is packaged within the nucleus. There is, however, a \nsmall amount of DNA inside the mitochondria, referred to as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).\nAs mitochondria were once free-living prokaryotes, it makes sense for them to carry their \nown genome. mtDNA is a small circular chromosome (similar to a plasmid) that is passed almost exclusively from mother to offspring. Upon fertilisation, the small amount of mtDNA  \nwithin the sperm cell is destroyed, leaving only the mtDNA of the female ovum. As a consequence, except in rare cases, the ability to pass on mtDNA from the father to future generations is lost.\nMitochondrial DNA\nMitochondrion\nFigure 10C\u20138 Each mitochondrion contains several mtDNA molecules and each cell has several hundred mitochondria, \nresulting in the high number of copies that is associated with mtDNA.LINK3B APPLICATION \nAND IMPLICATIONS OF DNA MANIPULATION TECHNIQUES\n10A CHANGES \nIN BIODIVERSITY OVER TIME\nLINK\nNuclear DNA is inherited \nfrom all ancestorsMitochondrial DNA is almost alwaysinherited from a single lineage,the maternal line\nFigure 10C\u20139 The inheritance of mtDNA is matrilineal, inherited  \nonly from the female or \u2018maternal\u2019 side, except in rare cases. \nLINK UNIT 2As you can see in Figure 10C\u20139, \nnuclear DNA is inherited as a combination of both maternal  and paternal DNA. The recombinant nature of this DNA results in changes to DNA sequences at every generation. For example, recombination of your parents\u2019 DNA resulted in your DNA, a third version that is distinct from both your parents. This pattern continues throughout generations, making backtracking through a species\u2019 ancestry a complicated process.\nIn contrast, mtDNA is derived \nonly from the maternal line, so no recombination occurs. While mtDNA does have a faster mutation rate than nuclear DNA, these mutations occur in a timely and systematic manner, \nmaking them easy to account for.  \nThe fast mutation rate also allows for comparisons to be made, not just between species, but also between different populations of the same species. These characteristics of mtDNA make it a valuable tool for scientists tracing the ancestry of a species.VIDEO 10C\u20131 \nUSING MTDNA AS EVIDENCE OF EVOLUTION\n445 10C EVIDENC E OF EVOLUT IONAR y RELATI ONSHIPS\n",
  "Page 458": "For example, a study in 1980 compared the number of mutations in the mtDNA of two \nhumans and two chimpanzees. It was found that there were half as many mtDNA differences between the two humans as there were between the two chimpanzees. From this, it can be concluded that the two humans (with fewer mtDNA mutations) shared a more recent common ancestor than the two chimpanzees (who had more mtDNA mutations).\nStudies have also found that, of all racial groups, African people have the greatest diversity \nin their mtDNA, as measured by the number of mutations. From this we can infer that African mtDNA is the oldest, and therefore the origin of humans lies in Africa. In fact, using mtDNA, geneticists have been able to trace every human on Earth back to one single female ancestor who lived approximately 200\n 000 years ago, known as Mitochondrial \nEve. You will learn more about the role of mtDNA in tracing the evolution of humans in \nSections 11B and 11C.\nComparing amino acid sequences\nLike DNA, proteins can also be analysed to determine species relatedness. This is done by analysing amino acid sequences in proteins that are common between the species of interest.\nA common example is the analysis of \namino acids that make up a portion of the haemoglobin molecule (Table 10C\u20132).\nFrom the information in Table 10C\u20132, \nyou can see that humans and chimpanzees have identical amino acid sequences for the portion of haemoglobin analysed. This means that they are the most closely related of the five species and therefore share the most recent common ancestor.\nConversely, humans have the least similarity with the horse and the zebra, as in both \ninstances, three of the four amino acids shown are different. This means that humans are least closely related to horses and zebras, and therefore shared a common ancestor longer ago.\nIt is possible to draw many other conclusions about \nthe relationships between the species in the table. For example, what does a comparison of the amino acid sequences of the horse and zebra tell us? What about the gorilla and the chimpanzee? Even with just a small amount of information, it is possible to learn a lot about the evolutionary relationships between species.\nOther types of proteins can also be analysed for \namino acid sequences. While haemoglobin is useful when comparing the relatedness of vertebrates, it is not useful for analysing the relationships between a wider variety of species, as not all organisms contain haemoglobin. For situations like this, the cytochrome c protein is useful, as it plays an important role in the electron transport chain of aerobic cellular respiration, which is used by almost every organism in the production of ATP.LINK11B MIGRATION \nOF MODERN \nHUMANS\n11C CLASSIFYING \nNEW DISCOVERIES \nOF HOMININS \nAND EVIDENCE OF \nINTERBREEDING \nBETWEEN \nSPECIESLINK\nTable 10C\u20132 Comparison of the amino acid \nsequence in the same part of the haemoglobin protein molecule, between species\nSpecies Sequence of amino acids\nHuman Lys-Glu-His-Iso\nHorse Arg-Lys-His-Lys\nGorilla Lys-Glu-His-Lys\nChimpanzee Lys-Glu-His-IsoZebra Arg-Lys-His-Arg\nLINK5C CELLULAR \nRESPIRATIONTable 10C\u20133 Number of amino acid \ndifferences in cytochrome c between humans and other species\nOrganism Number of amino \nacid differences to \nhumans\nChimpanzee 0\nRhesus monkey 1\nRabbit 9\nCow 10\nPigeon 12\nRattlesnake 14\nBull frog 20\nFruit fly 24\nGarden snail 29\nWheat germ 37\nYeast 44\nMould 48\n446\nCHAPTER 10 EVOLUTION OVER TIME\n",

  "Page 462": "10C SKILLS\nInterpreting phylogenetic trees\nThe ability to use and interpret phylogenetic trees for species relatedness is a specific dot point in the Study Design. It is therefore important that you feel confident in your ability to draw accurate conclusions from them, as they will certainly feature in your end-of-year examination.\nAt the beginning of this section, you were presented with a graph that showed the \nsimilarity of DNA within different species. The information in that graph has been converted into the phylogenetic tree below.\nWhile it is easy to see that, based on the recency of common  \nancestry, the human and the chimpanzee are the most  closely related and the human and E. coli are least  closely related, there is a wide range of other  information in this diagram.\nConsider the following questions, for example.  \nAll the information required to answer  them accurately is provided in the  diagram.\nQuestion\n1 \n Identify the species that would have the most features in common with a banana.\nAnswerThe earthworm. To answer this correctly, look for which other organism the banana \nshared its most recent common ancestor with. The diagram shows this to be the earthworm.\nQuestion2 \n Consider the zebrafish and the mouse. Which of these would you expect to have \nmore in common with the fruitfly?\nAnswer\nThe zebrafish. Once again, it is a matter of using the diagram to determine who has \nthe most recent common ancestor with the fruitfly. \nQuestion3 \n The teeth and skeleton of a mouse, a cat and a chimpanzee were examined. \nMore similarities were observed between the mouse and the chimpanzee than \nbetween the cat and the mouse.

  "Page 463": "Answer\nNo. According to the phylogenetic tree, the mouse and the chimpanzee had a \ncommon ancestor longer ago than the mouse and the cat, who shared a common ancestor more recently. This means there has been greater opportunity for mutations to accumulate between the mouse and the chimpanzee, which would result in their skeletons looking less similar than the skeletons of the mouse and the cat, where there has been less time for mutations to occur.\nMolecular homology: are DNA or amino acid comparisons better?\nDNA and amino acid sequence comparisons are both valuable tools for scientists \ninvestigating species relatedness. But is one more useful than the other?\nIn general, comparing DNA sequences is more useful than comparing amino acid \nsequences. This is a good opportunity for you to reflect on Section 9A, where you investigated mutations. Recall specifically the work you did on silent substitution point mutations. These types of mutations have no impact on the formation of amino acid sequences that make up a protein (see Figure 10C\u201314). Therefore, if you were analysing amino acid sequences alone, this mutation would not be detected, and any conclusions that were drawn on species relatedness from this analysis would be misleading.\nAnalysing DNA sequences, on the other hand, would pick up all mutations, including the \nsilent substitution point mutations. It is for this reason that molecular homology using DNA sequences is deemed by scientists to be the most accurate and preferred\u00a0option.5\u00b4\nSer Val Pro Tyr3\u00b4\nAGCGTAC C C TAC\n5\u00b4 3\u00b4DNA coding\nstrandNormal DNA Mutated DNA: Substitution\nmRNA\nAmino\nacidsAGCGUAC C C UAC5\u00b4 3\u00b4\nAGCGT C C C TAC\n5\u00b4 3\u00b4\nAGCGU U C C C UAC\nSer Val Pro TyrT\nFigure 10C\u201314 Note the substitution of a thymine nucleotide in place of an adenine nucleotide. \nThis mutation still results in the addition of the amino acid valine (Val) to the growing polypeptide chain, so if amino acid sequences alone were analysed, this mutation would not be identified.\nSection 10C questions\n1  Use the information in Figure 10C\u20133 to copy and complete the table.\nPentadactyl limb Modification Function\nHuman\nHorseBatWhaleMoleCatLINK 9A MUTATIONS\n451 10C EVIDENC E OF EVOLUT IONAR y RELATI ONSHIPS\n",

  "Page 472": "HOW DOES LIFE CHANGE AND RESPOND TO \nCHALLENGES?\nIntroduction\nOver the past century, palaeontologists have attempted to uncover the ancestral lineages that \nwill provide definitive evidence for the development and evolution of modern humans, Homo sapiens. In 1924, key fossilised remains were uncovered that demonstrated the transition from apes to Homo sapiens some 3 million years ago. Since then, new discoveries have been a regular occurrence, especially in recent decades. These include more fossils of already known species, as well as new species previously unknown to paleontologists. With the assistance of some of the forms of evidence for evolution outlined in Chapter 10, the story of the evolutionary pathway for the rise of modern humans from their ape-like ancestors continues to be refined. Additionally, the classification of key structural features and the possibility of interbreeding between different species continues to drive scientists to question what they thought they understood previously. It also allows scientists to predict the placement of not only these new species in the evolutionary timeline, but our own position in this wide-branching phylogenetic tree.\nThis chapter explores the key characteristics shared by ancestral human species with Homo \nsapiens. It studies the migration patterns and timing of ancestral human populations from Africa and the evidence used to confirm these predictions.

This includes the many ancestral species of modern humans over the past 7 million years, a very short time span in the context of life on Earth. Small groups of these species were separated and isolated from their original group and, over time, as a result of mutations and natural selection, were not well adapted to their changing environment. Consequently, they were unable to survive and became extinct.\nWith developments in technology and transportation, migration (gene flow) has become \ncheaper, more convenient and more frequent. Does this reduction in geographical isolation of populations preclude our species from undergoing further evolution?\nMany scientists suspected that this was the case. However, recent research suggests \notherwise. This research involved mapping the human genome. It indicated that there were more than 300 regions within our DNA that continue to change. Examples include changes in pigmentation of the skin in populations in northern Europe and Asia, as well as changes to eye colour in northern European populations.LINK10A \nCHANGES IN BIODIVERSITY OVER TIME\n \nFigure 11A\u20131 Changes in the pigmentation of the skin and eye colour are noticeable in \nindividuals from Asia (left) and northern Europe (right).LINK 9A MUTATIONS\nLINK9B EVOLVING \nAND NON-EVOLVING POPULATIONS\n463 11A CLASSIFI CATION  AND CHARACT ERISTICS  OF MODERN  HUMANS\nISBN 978-1 108-89462-3 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this materi l must not be tra sferred to another party.\nS mon Maaser et al. 2021\n",
  "Page 476": "LINK8A EMERGENCE, \nRE-EMERGENCE \nAND DISEASE \nCONTAINMENTIn fact, over the past 10  000 years, it is estimated from cultural and technological \ndevelopments that humans have evolved approximately 100 times faster than at any \ntime in the previous 7 million years. One of the main reasons for this is the rapid rate at which our living conditions have changed. With the world\u2019s human population growing rapidly, the need for more efficient methods of agriculture and construction has grown too. While cities grow and encroach on land that was previously agricultural or wild, and humans live in closer proximity to other hum\nans and to animals, new \ndiseases continue to emerge. In areas where there is poor hygiene, infrastructure and education, the chances of survival of individuals is dramatically affected. Scientists work to develop vaccines and improve methods of agriculture and sanitation, to increase the survival of all people, rich and poor. Human evolution is no longer dependent on biological change alone. It is now influenced dramatically by both cultural and technological\u00a0advancements.\nEXPLAIN\nClassification of modern humans\nThere are approximately 8.7 million species of organisms on Earth. To classify all these organisms, scientists place them into eight categories, in a heirarchy based on the similarities and differences between them. In biology, this hierarchy is known as a taxonomic series.\nVery\ngeneral\nSpeciesVery\nspeci\ufb01cGenusFamilyOrderClassPhylumKingdomDomain\nFigure 11A\u20132 The classification system for living organisms\nLINK10C EVIDENCE OF \nEVOLUTIONARY \nRELATIONSHIPSThe taxonomy  built up by scientists in the past centuries grouped organisms according \nto their physical features, using predominantly their homologous structures . Remember \nfrom Section 10C that homologous structures are found in species that share a recent common ancestor and have a similar morphological structure but vary depending on the organism\u2019s environment and selection pressures. However, in the past few decades this approach has been superseded by the new scientific discipline of \nmolecular phylogeny , \nwhich compares nucleotide sequences of genes and amino acid sequences of proteins, from which evolutionary relationships can be inferred. In some cases this supports the previous taxonomy, but in others it leads to considerable revisions. The extraction of DNA from fossils, preserved organisms and existing species is revolutionising the field of taxonomy.Taxonomy \nthe process of identifying, naming and grouping organisms\nHomologous \nstructure a structure within a group of species that performs a different function yet has the same underlying structure\nMolecular \nphylogeny comparison of nucleotide sequences of genes and amino acid sequences of proteins, from which evolutionary relationships can be inferredLINK7E ACTIVE \nAND PASSIVE \nIMMUNITY\nVIDEO 11A\u20131 \nTAXONOMY OF \nMODERN HUMANS\n464\nCHAPTER 11 HUMAN EVOLUTION\nISBN 978-1 108-89462-3 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this materi l must not be tra sferred to another party.\nS mon Maaser et al. 2021\n",

Before continuing further in this chapter, it is important that you re-read the information in the table. Throughout this section, the term \u2018hominin\u2019 is used extensively. Hominins include all organisms that are capable of extended periods of bipedalism. This includes not only modern humans, Homo sapiens, but also ancestral species of the genuses Australopithecus and Homo, which will be referred to extensively in this chapter.\nAs you can see in Table 11A\u20131, following on from the subfamily, the two most specific \nlevels of the hierarchical classification system are genus and species. A genus is a group of closely related organisms that share a very recent common ancestor, whereas a species is a particular group of organisms within a genus. A species can be defined as a group of individuals that are capable of interbreeding to produce viable, fertile offspring (as you learnt in Section 9D). The easy way to remember this is that genus refers to \u2018generic\u2019, whereas species refers to an organism\u2019s \u2018specific\u2019 name. Each species has its own unique and universal name. The name of modern humans is Homo sapiens, which translates as \u2018wise man\u2019. After being stated in full, such scientific names can be abbreviated within the same piece of text provided there's no danger of confusion. The abbreviation is the initial of the genus plus the full specific name, so here we can now write H. sapiens.\nLINK9D EMERGENCE \nOF A NEW SPECIES\n467 11A CLASSIF ICATION  AND CHARAC TERISTICS  OF MODERN  HUMANS\n",

With human evolution in particular, as you will discover in Section 11C, new fossils are constantly being uncovered that reveal new species. This allows scientists to compare them to existing hominins, as well as forcing us to rethink our current classification scheme. This scheme now includes genetic evidence as a basis for comparing species. For this reason, an older classification scheme that initially had humans in their own Family, separate from the great apes, was abandoned. Genetic comparisons showed that humans and chimpanzees are more closely related than chimpanzees and gorillas. This evidence also confirmed that there is approximately a 7% difference in the genomes of apes and monkeys.

In fact, the development and use of tools has only been definitively attributed to the Homo genus, approximately 2.6 mya. So when we talk  about hominins being able to manipulate \u2018objects\u2019, it is only in the case of Homo that  we mean \u2018tools\u2019.\nIt is hypothesised that this freeing of the hands subsequently led to the increase in size and \ndevelopment of the brain, which is explained further below.\nNOTE\nIt is important to understand that the real reason(s) for hominins becoming bipedal are not \nfully known. However, fossil evidence, both biological (skeletal hominin, other animal and plant remains) and cultural (tools, fire pit, and so on), has influenced scientists\u2019 knowledge of the likely environment at the time for different ancestral species, leading to some of the reasons listed in Table 11A\u20132.\nChanges in the skull\nChange in brain volume\nOver time, the size of the brain has increased. This is observed when looking at the average \nvolume in cubic centimetres (cm3, which is equivalent to volume in mL). As can be seen in \nFigure 11A\u20137, the average size of the brain of a chimpanzee is 300 cm3, compared to that of \na modern human at 1300 cm3.\nLINK 10B FOSSILSNOTE\nAs you know from Section 10B, the tissue that makes up the brain would not have fossilised. \nTherefore, the average volume of the brain for each species is estimated based on internal casts (called endocasts) of the skulls uncovered.\n473 11A CLASSIF ICATION  AND CHARAC TERISTICS  OF MODERN  HUMANS\n",

However, it is thought that hominins becoming bipedal likely led to an increase in the size of the brain. The biggest advantages of bipedalism were:\n \u2022the hands were freed, resulting in a further expansion of the cerebellum. This is the area of the brain responsible for fine movement and sensation of the fingers. Ultimately, this led to the development and use of tools by the Homo genus.\n \u2022standing taller led to an increase in size of the occipital lobe. This region assists with increased vision over greater distances.Changes in other parts of the skull\nStructurally, the shape and size of other parts of the skull changed with the development of the brain.

Again, you can infer the general trend of this change from the apes, through Australopithecus and earlier Homo species, leading to what we now observe today with Homo sapiens.

Of course, these adaptations would have arisen as a result of spontaneous mutations initially occurring in specific individuals.\nA typical question may be:\nQuestion\nWhy did bipedalism evolve in a specific population?OrWhy was bipedalism an important adaptation in a specific ancestral hominin species?\nTo answer these questions, you need to be able to refer to all the key points you learnt \npreviously, including these:\n \u2022There was initially variation (as a result of mutation) in the population.

What was the environment like, and what was present in the environment that resulted in individuals who displayed bipedalism having a selective advantage?\nTo answer this, you must consider what the environment would have been like for \nancestors of humans who were not bipedal. It is likely that they lived in a richly dense forest environment, abundant with trees. Perhaps a spec\nies was pushed out of this \nenvironment due to a lack of food. As a result, they were required to explore new environments, moving out to the savannah where there were open plains and few trees. Finding water and food may have required greater distances to be covered, which was difficult on all fours. The sun may have been intense, and bipedal individuals, who had less of their body\u2019s surface area exposed to the sun, were able to keep their body temperature lower. Once having found food or other resources, bipedal individuals would have been able to carry these while moving, unlike individuals who were quadrupeds. If you extrapolate this further, these bipedal individuals were therefore able to provide for their tribe. They became more sexually appealing to members of that tribe, meaning they reproduced, and there was more likelihood of their alleles being passed to the next generation.\nEven though reference to specific environments was not covered in this section, you can \nuse your knowledge of adaptations, evolution and the structural features of hominins to predict why these features flourished in the first place.\nMaking comparisons in responses to questions\nWhen answering questions that require you to compare the structural differences between hominins, it is important to write your answers in a way that clearly shows a comparison between the two species.\nFor example:\nQuestionWith reference to the skull shown below, identify two reasons why you know this is a \nHomo erectus individual and not an individual of the Homo sapiens species.\nLINK UNIT 2\nVIDEO 11A\u20134 \nSKILLS: MAKING \nCOMPARISONS\n478\nCHAPTER 11 HUMAN EVOLUTION\n",

Initial dating techniques placed the age of this species at 100\n 000\u201360  000 years ago, \nindicating that it coexisted with Homo sapiens. This date of 60\n 000 years also made it a critical new \ndiscovery, as it was one of the most recent hominin species to become extinct.\nHowever, this species proved to be unlike \npreviously known hominins at the time. It did not follow the trend in anatomical features seen in previous hominin fossils uncovered, and those outlined in Section 11A. It had a small body \u2013 only 1 metre tall, considerably shorter than Homo erectus (average height 1.6 metres) and Homo sapiens (average height 1.65 metres). Its skull was also quite small, even for its small body size, with estimates of a brain volume of 400 cm\n3, similar to \nthat of chimpanzees. Despite this smaller brain size, evidence also suggested that they made and used stone tools, controlled fire and hunted wild animals. Scientists believe their short stature was due to island dwarfism \u2013 a fast-acting version of natural selection as a result of no gene flow occurring in an island environment in which predation and limited food were selection pressures. This dwarfism, and potentially their small brain size, was a way to reduce unnecessary energy usage to survive, allowing for reproduction.\nIn 2016, further dating undertaken on newly found lower jaw and teeth fossils indicated \nthat these were 700\n 000 years old and were from an earlier form of Homo floresiensis.\nThe island of Flores is separated from mainland Asia, and even during periods of low sea levels, the crossing would have been close to 25 kilometres. Even though there are other \nexamples of organisms worldwide that have reached islands by swimming or floating on \ndebris, exactly how and when H. floresiensis\n arrived at the island remains a mystery.\nThis section explores some of the forms of evidence scientists use to help classify newly discovered remains, and which species are direct ancestors of these, as well as the migratory patterns of hominins from Africa.\nFigure 11B\u20131 Digital reconstruction \nof Homo floresiensis from fossilised remains discovered on the island of Flores, IndonesiaLINK11A \nCLASSIFICATION AND CHARACTERISTICS OF MODERN HUMANS\nLINK10C EVIDENCE OF EVOLUTIONARY RELATIONSHIPSLINK\nLINK 10B FOSSILS9B EVOLVING AND NON-EVOLVING POPULATIONS\n481 11B MIGRATIO N OF MODERN  HUMANS\n",

For human evolution, there are advantages in using both nuclear and \nmitochondrial DNA. These will be covered in the 11C Skills section.\nComparing the DNA sequences of specific genes, chromosomes or whole genomes allows \nscientists to determine the number of differences between two species. The measure \nof the number of spontaneous mutations that have accumulated in a gene sequence is \nbased on the assumption that mutations occur at a known\n constant rate and therefore \nan approximate amount of time can be calculated since the two species diverged from a common ancestor. This is referred to as the \nmolecular clock .\nIn Section 11C, you will see how the use of DNA sequences, primarily mtDNA sequences, have also been used to determine whether interbreeding between species occurred.\nFossils\nRecall from Section 10B that fossils can be used to confirm evidence of the relatedness between species through comparative anatomy, namely homologous structures. Comparing these similar structures allows scientists to infer other features of hominins that may not have been recovered from fossil evidence. Fossil evidence may not be restricted to that of deceased organisms, but can also include the existence of tools, evidence of fire-pits, agricultural practices or artwork. These also provide an understanding of the behaviour and capabilities of hominins during certain time periods. If remains are well preserved, DNA samples from cells can be obtained, to compare the molecular homology of these species with species whose genomes are already fully or partially mapped. The sedimentary layers surrounding the fossil can also be dated using radiometric techniques, providing an absolute age of that layer, and therefore the fossil.\nHowever, as you will also recall, interpreting the \nfossil record is difficult because the record is largely incomplete. This is especially true for hominin evolution. The current fossil record for hominins is largely composed of skulls, rather than structures that directly indicate whether hominins were bipedal or quadrupedal. As such, scientists have used the skulls to indicate more than just LINK11C CLASSIFYING \nNEWLY \nDISCOVERED \nHOMININS AND \nEVIDENCE FOR \nINTERBREEDING \nBETWEEN \nSPECIES\nMolecular \nhomology the analysis of DNA and amino acid sequences as evidence of evolutionary relationships\nMolecular clock \nusing the predicted mutation rate of DNA (or amino acid) sequences to determine the approximate time at which two species divergedLINK10C \nEVIDENCE OF \nEVOLUTIONARY \nRELATIONSHIPS\nLINK11C CLASSIFYING \nNEWLY \nDISCOVERED \nHOMININS AND \nEVIDENCE FOR \nINTERBREEDING \nBETWEEN \nSPECIES\nLINK 10B FOSSILS\nLINK11C CLASSIFYING \nNEWLY \nDISCOVERED \nHOMININS AND \nEVIDENCE FOR \nINTERBREEDING \nBETWEEN \nSPECIESFigure 11B\u20132 A fossilised skull of Homo \nneanderthalensis\n482\nCHAPTER 11 HUMAN EVOLUTION\n",

From this, they can infer things such as their level of cultural evolution and ability to use tools or control the use of fire. As you will see from the three examples presented in Section 11C, this jigsaw is slowly being put together.\nThe two waves of human migration\nFrom current fossil and mtDNA evidence, scientists know that hominins evolved in Africa. From the timeline of hominin evolution on pages 470\u2013471, the Australopithecus genus (and species present prior to this but not discussed) existed solely in different regions of Africa. Early members of the Homo genus, such as Homo habilis, also appeared only in Africa.\nIn terms of the movement of ancestral hominins out of Africa, scientists\u2019 theories include \nthe following:\n \u2022A group of Homo erectus or a group from an unknown species of the Homo genus similar to Homo habilis\n were the first to leave Africa, 2\u20131.75 mya. These hominins had \na larger brain volume (approximately 600 cm3), were capable of tool use and had a diet \nthat included meat, so a wider variety of foods could be consumed.\n \u2022Other hominins, possibly still undiscovered, moved from Africa into parts of Asia as early as 1 mya. There was also movement of these hominins back into Africa.\n \u2022A group of Homo heidelbergensis, proposed as the ancestor of Homo neanderthalensis, due to their stocky body shape and size, moved out of Africa into Europe as early as 900\n 000 years ago. With changing environments, this species underwent evolutionary \nchanges that led to the rise of H. neanderthalensis by approximately 300  000 years ago.\nWhat about the migration of Homo sapiens? How did we come to exist on different continents? One theory proposed by scientists is the Out of Africa theory, which states that H. sapiens arose in Africa and then moved out of Africa to other continents in two waves at different times.\nThe key piece of evidence to support this theory is that c\nurrent humans have very little \ngenetic diversity. The greatest diversity would be found in Africa, where Homo sapiens first \nappeared, as there has been more time for spontaneous mutations to accumulate.\nThe first wave: 160  000 to 100  000 years ago\nFossil evidence of Homo sapiens is limited, due to the short time frame in which we have existed. However, from fossilised remains of our species, scientists have observed the following key points in relation to the first migratory wave of Homo sapiens:\n \u2022Homo sapiens fossils in East Africa have been dated to approximately 160  000 years  \nago.\n \u2022Evidence suggests that migration into northern parts of Africa occurred, likely along the eastern coastline.\n \u2022Homo sapiens reached what is now referred to as the Middle East approximately  100\n 000 years ago.\nScientists know four species existed by 100  000 years ago: H. neanderthalensis in Europe,  \nH. denisova in Russia, H. floresiensis in Indonesia and \nH. sapiens in Africa and the Middle \nEast, as mentioned above.\n483 11B MIGRATI ON OF MODERN  HUMANS\n",

Three bodies were uncovered here between 1969 and 1974. The first and most famous, called Mungo Lady, was later determined to have been ritualistically buried. Five years later, a male skeleton was uncovered, and called Mungo Man. Mungo Man had also been ritualistically buried. These two individuals and the nature of their burials are among the earliest evidence of this cultural practice in the world.\nThese are the oldest human remains \ndiscovered in Australia, having been dated at 42\n 000\u201340  000 years old. It is believed \nthat Aboriginal peoples would have arrived at the lake at around this time and found a \nrich diversity of plant and animal life. Evidence indicates that the lake was thriving, with fish, shellfish and yabbies, and the high vegetation around the lake, including eucalyptus trees, would have attracted many birds, frogs, reptiles and other mammals. Evidence also indicates that the Aboriginal population in this area built fires, developed tools and painted their bodies.\nIn 2003, geologists uncovered 460 footprints in a clay pan around the lake. This was the \nlargest collection to date globally of fossilised footprints \nin a single find, and some of the \noldest \u2013 dating estimated them to be from 20  000 years ago.\nToday, the Paakantji, Mutthi Mutthi and Ngyimpaa people continue to maintain a close \nconnection to the now World Heritage-listed Willandra Lakes, which include Lake Mungo.

Instead, New Guinea, mainland Australia, and Tasmania were joined and formed a mega-continent referred to as Sahul.\nThis mega-continent existed from before the time the first people arrived right \nup until about 8000\u201310\n 000 years ago. ...\nWhen we talk about how and in what ways people first arrived in Australia, we really mean in Sahul.\nWe know people have been in Australia for a very long time \u2013 at least for the \npast 50\n 000 years, and possibly substantially longer than that.The Dreaming is a system of belief of many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and a way to confirm their origin.

It was very much a planned and well-organised maritime migration.\nOur results are similar to findings from several studies that also suggest this \nnumber of people is required to populate a new environment successfully, especially as people spread out of Africa and arrived in new regions around the world.\nThe overall implications of these results are fascinating. They verify that the first \nancestors of Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander, and Melanesian people to arrive in Sahul possessed sophisticated technological knowledge to build watercraft, and they were able to plan, navigate, and make complicated, open-ocean voyages to transport large numbers of people toward targeted destinations.\nOur results also suggest that they did so by making many directed voyages, \npotentially over centuries, providing the beginnings of the complex, interconnected Indigenous societies that we see across the continent today.\nThese findings are a testament to the remarkable sophistication and adaptation \nof the first maritime arrivals in Sahul tens of thousands of years ago.\n490\nCHAPTER 11 HUMAN EVOLUTION\n",

It therefore provides an easy way for scientists to trace the direct lineage of the maternal ancestor to descendants through the number of mutations between these sequences.\nScientists can therefore trace mitochondrial DNA back to one common ancestor, whom \nthey refer to as Mitochondrial Eve. This name is taken from the biblical Adam and Eve. It is suspected that Mitochondrial Eve lived between 200\n 000 and 100  000 years \nago in southern regions of Africa. Mitochondrial Eve would not have been the first Homo sapiens present, but every previous female lineage eventually had no more female offspring, meaning that this passing on of that specific mitochondrial DNA ceased. Therefore, all current H. sapiens alive today can trace their mitochondrial DNA back to Mitochondrial Eve.\nAs you will recall from Section 11B, since the time of Mitochondrial Eve, modern \nhumans have gone through two waves of migration, spread\ning from regions within \nAfrica to other continents. In this time, different Indigenous populations have arisen, and distinct ethnic groups are now present on each continent. Genetically, these groups have gone through significant changes due to very different selection pressures and environments, as well as genetic bottlenecks.\nIn 2010, scientists discovered the fossil remains of a man in southern Africa who is \nbelieved to have been the closest known relative of Mitochondrial Eve. His ancestors are believed to have diverged from this earliest lineage related to Mitochondrial Eve. He died some 2300 years ago, around 315 BC.\nScientists hope to continue to uncover remains and compare their mitochondrial and \nnuclear genomes, gaining more information about the migration of modern humans, as well as a clearer understanding of how different groups of hominins mixed and interbred with each other.

As you will learn in this section, analysis of their DNA indicates that interbreeding occurred between some of these species. From the understanding you developed in Section 9D, how is it possible that different species thousands of years ago were able to produce viable, fertile offspring?\nThis question stems from a common misunderstanding of what defines a biological species.Palaeontologists often use structural morphology to classify species as being distinctly \ndifferent and therefore different species. However, it is more likely that genetic similarities between species give a more accurate indication of whether they can interbreed. This is commonly seen with members of the Canis genus, which includes wolves and dogs. Both have 39 pairs of chromosomes. This means that they can \ninterbreed , likely as a result of the \nchromosomes being able to pair up during meiosis. The same could have been the case for different classified species of humans, such as H. sapiens, H. denisova, H. neanderthalensis \n(and even H. erectus), as is discussed in this section.LINK11A CLASSI-\nFICATION AND CHARACTERIS-TICS OF MODERN HUMANS\n9D EMERGENCE \nOF A NEW SPECIES\nLINK10C EVIDENCE OF EVOLUTIONARY RELATIONSHIPS\nInterbreed \nmate with an organism of another species (sometimes used between different genetic groups or populations)\n \nFigure 11C\u20131 Wolves (left) and dogs (right) are members of the Canis genus and are capable \nof interbreeding to produce fertile offspring, likely due to them having the same number of chromosomes, 39 pairs.\nIt is therefore important to realise that views are constantly changing and being contested \nor refined as new evidence and analysis shed new light on what scientists currently understand about human evolution.\nHominins that were capable of interbreeding with modern humans\nRecent discoveries of hominin fossils, as well as earlier discoveries of Neanderthal fossils in the mid-19th century, along with analysis of their DNA sequences, have confirmed scientists\u2019 understanding that there was interbreeding between species. These discoveries and analysis have also helped clarify scientists\u2019 understanding of the relationships between different species of hominins, when they were likely to have coexisted in a similar environment, and the migratory patterns of modern humans (explored in Section 11B).\nThe key examples presented below indicate how our understanding of the lineage of \nancestors of Homo sapiens continues to be altered and adjusted in response to new discoveries and analysis.LINK UNIT 2\nLINK11B MIGRATION \nOF MODERN HUMANSLINK\nVIDEO 11C\u20131 INTERBREEDING BETWEEN HOMININS\n493 11C CLASSIFYING NEWLY DISCOVERED HOMININS\n",

The mtDNA, which was well preserved thanks to the very cold and dry environment within the cave, further confirmed that this was a distinct species, although it had a close similarity to both H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens.\nIn the same Siberian cave, scientists also uncovered fossilised remains of both  \nH. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens. Comparisons of mtDNA sequences showed that  the mtDNA genomes of the Denisovans were 17% identical to the Neanderthals,  suggesting that at some point these two species successfully interbred.\nFurther comparison of the nuclear DNA genomes of H. denisova and certain modern-day \npopulations of humans has provided definitive evidence that they share approximately 4\u20136% of this DNA. These populations are the Melanesians (inhabitants of Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji and New Caledonia), as well as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Therefore, there was likely interbreeding at some point with ancestors of these species as they migrated through the southern and south-eastern parts of Asia, before they arrived in their current island locations.

A phylogenetic tree based on these mtDNA comparisons was developed and is shown in the figure below.\nAfricans\n&\nnon-Africans\nAfricansAfricansNeanderthal\nThe phylogenetic tree shows that there is no similarity between Neanderthal mtDNA \nand the mtDNA of various current African populations. It also shows that there is a great deal of variation in the mtDNA of African populations, further emphasising that modern humans evolved in Africa. The mtDNA of other human populations, like Europeans and Chinese, was also analysed. Although not shown in the figure above, a small percentage, approximately 1\u20133%, of their mtDNA was similar to Neanderthals.\nQuestionDoes the information presented above indicate that ancestors of current-day African \npopulations interbred with Neanderthals? Explain your answer.\nTo answer this question, you need to be able to identify some important points:1 \n The location of the Neanderthals\u2019 existence, which was mostly in Europe.\n2  The lack of similarity between the mtDNA in Neanderthals and current African populations.\n3 \n The small percentage of similarity between the mtDNA of Neanderthals and populations found outside Africa today.\n4 \n What comparing DNA sequences between different organisms or species allows scientists to determine.\nAnswerThe information indicates that there was no interbreeding between Neanderthals and \nancestors of current African populations. This is due to the migration of ancestors of modern humans from Africa to regions such as Europe after Neanderthals had \ninhabited that area. These ancestors of modern humans then remained or moved to regions further into Europe, but not back to Africa, where those populations continued to evolve independently.\nYou can see from this answer that the information you h\nave learnt in Sections 11B and \n11C is very much intertwined, and you may be required to use knowledge from both sections in your answer.

They plan for new investigations and adjust the practical investigations they are currently undertaking. They work both individually and in teams to share knowledge for the greater good of humans and the existence and survival of many other species. Some of the greatest discoveries in the past two centuries have come from this process, and include:\n \u2022the discovery of the structure of DNA by James Watson, Francis Crick, Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins in 1953\n \u2022the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in 1928 and its subsequent development as a drug by the Australian Howard Florey Institute\n \u2022Gregor Mendel\u2019s published work with pea plants in 1865 after eight years of growing thousands of pea plants and tracking their progeny and traits, to discover the laws of Mendelian inheritance \n \u2022the discovery of the structure of insulin and other large biological molecules by Dorothy Hodgkin through her leadership and encouragement of a team of scientists, going on to collaborate with other laboratories to develop mass production of the hormone and inspire the development of related diabetes drugs \n \u2022the development of a vaccine against the virus that causes cervical cancer, in Australia by a team of scientists led by Professor Ian Frazer in 2006.

  "Page 526": "EXPLAIN\nStructuring a logbook \u2013 investigative design\nThese discoveries were possible not only due \nto the persistence and determination of the scientists but also, no doubt, through their effective use of a logbook. A logbook allows a scientist to keep track of the specific dates of their investigation ideas, planning, questions, important results, errors and any modifications required, thereby maintaining a record of all work conducted. A requirement of the VCE is that each student must maintain a printed logbook of practical activities in Units 1\u20134 for assessment purposes. The need for a printed logbook, rather than an online or digital logbook, removes the likelihood of any tampering with results. Of course, this will depend on your school and your teacher\u2019s authentication practices, so it is best to work within your school\u2019s guidelines.\nIn this section, you will learn how to develop a logbook for your own practical investigation \nand the importance of each section in contributing to the end product. This is usually in the form of a scientific poster (outlined in Section 12C).\nAn important function of an effective logbook is that it clearly demonstrates the \ndevelopment of the ideas that come from your research and investigation, including changes in direction, equipment failures and so on, as well as your collaboration and discussion with peers. This is demonstrated in the example below, which shows two versions of the same investigation:\n \u2022Investigation 1 is the initial version. The ideas that are highlighted for the \ninvestigation are not perfect but they show the initial planning coming together.\n \u2022Investigation 2 is the final version. Adjustments have been made to the initial \ninvestigation to improve the validity and reliability of the results (terms explored in more detail later).\nThe investigation involved finding the optimal temperature for an enzyme.

  "Page 527": "LINK UNITS 1&2Introduction In the introduction (to \na poster) it can also be appropriate to present a labelled diagram of the concept/idea being investigated. 1Enzymes are essential to help reactions proceed more efficiently, \nin order to sustain life. They are made of proteins, which are coded for by an organism's DNA, and they are specific to the substance they act on.\n2The enzyme catalase reacts with the substrate hydrogen peroxide (H\n2O2), breaking it down into water and oxygen (products) in a \ncatabolic reaction. Catalase is primarily found in the liver and is important in protecting the organism from damage caused by hydrogen peroxide, which is constantly produced by mammals.\nThe rate of reaction between an enzyme and the substrate can \nbe affected by many things, such as concentration of enzyme and substrate, pH level and inhibitors. It can also be affected by temperature. Every enzyme has an optimal temperature, at which its rate of reaction is highest with the most successful collisions with the substrate. The general rule for this is that, as temperature increases, the rate of reaction increases until optimal temperature is reached. Any further increase in temperature will result in a dramatic drop in rate of reaction and may lead to denaturation of the enzyme. Denaturation is an irreversible process caused by the hydrogen bonds being broken, destroying the characteristic 3D structure of the protein and therefore changing its active site so it cannot bind to the substrate.\nThe normal functioning temperature for a human is 37\u00b0C, which is \nsimilar to that of a lamb, where the liver containing catalase was obtained from. If the temperature decreases in the lamb, then there is less kinetic energy and therefore fewer successful collisions between the enzyme and substrate, leaving the lamb vulnerable to damage occurring from the peroxide. Similarly, if the temperature increases to a certain point, the enzyme denatures again, leaving it vulnerable.\nAim The aim includes \nexplicit reference to the independent and dependent variable.1To determine the temperature at which catalase functions most \nefficiently.\n2To determine the optimal temperature for the enzyme catalase, by measuring the height of bubbles (oxygen gas) produced during the breakdown of the substrate hydrogen peroxide. \nHypothesis The hypothesis is a \nprediction of what you think will occur. It does not have to be correct, but should be supported by knowledge of the theory, which is the difference between investigations 1 and 2. 1That the catalase will function best at 37\u00b0C.\n2That as the temperature to which the lamb liver is exposed \nincreases, so too will the rate of reaction, producing a greater height of oxygen bubbles until the optimal temperature of 37\u00b0C (normal temperature of a live lamb) is reached. Any further increase in temperature will lower the rate of reaction due to the 3D conformational shape of the catalase denaturing.Introduction \na detailed but succinct explanation of the reason for undertaking an investigation; includes key biological concepts, aim and hypothesis\nAim the main purpose of an investigation and what you hope to achieve\nHypothesis  a prediction of the outcomes, which are testable experimentally and form the basis of the methodology\nNOTE\nScientific \ntheories and models are built up from hypotheses.

  "Page 535": "Systematic errors A systematic error \ncannot be improved by repeating measurements, having a larger sample size or taking a mean. As the results are always out by a consistent value, they will always be inaccurate. Therefore, a change in the method or equipment must occur.1Each time the liver was transferred from the water bath to the set-\nup, its temperature changed, which could have affected the results.\n2For liver that was initially kept at temperatures below room temperature (0\u00b0C, 10\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C), transferring it from the water bath to the conical flask resulted in a slight increase in temperature. Additionally, the way the experiment was set up meant that the oxygen produced from the reaction needed to travel from the conical flask through the tubing and into the test tube. This would not be an accurate representation of all the oxygen causing bubbles to be formed, as some of the oxygen each time would remain in the conical flask, thereby affecting the results for the investigation at each temperature.\nRandom errors The effect of a \nrandom error can be reduced by repeating measurements, having a larger sample size and/or taking a mean. As results are equally likely to be high or low, averaging can improve the precision of results. For most experiments in a laboratory where multiple trials are conducted, you will need to account for the effect of these on your investigation. You may need to also account for \noutliers  by repeating \nmeasurements.1There were no random errors because the experiment was only \nconducted once.\n2Random errors were present in this experiment, as it is clear that there are differences in measurements between the three trials at each temperature. This could have been due to human errors in measuring the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide or in cutting and weighing pieces of lamb liver. It could also be due to fluctuations in the temperature of the water bath away from the set temperature when heating the 2 g of liver.

The discussion should include the following key content:\n \u2022Interpret and evaluate the trends and patterns in your data  \u2013 use a graph if possible, as \nthis will clearly show the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. It is important here to also quote relevant data from the table or graph when referring to trends in the data.\n \u2022Acknowledge any deviations (outliers) in the data from the results that were expected \u2013 relate the results to the relevant biological theory and key terms. This is very important, as this outlines how well you understand your results and can interpret them based on your knowledge of the theory. Therefore, use the knowledge in previous chapters of this book to help with the respective topic you are investigating.\n \u2022State whether the data you collected supports or doesn\u2019t support the hypothesis.\n \u2022Identify any limitations in the data or the method \u2013 refer to random and systematic errors, and accuracy and precision, as discussed earlier in this chapter.\n \u2022Suggest future improvements to the investigation if it were to be performed again \u2013 this means referring to experimental errors, not human errors (e.g. incorrect measuring of volume or not timing with a stopwatch appropriately). If your experiment is performed \ncorrectly, there should be no human errors.\nNOTE\nAvoid terms such as \u2018proved\u2019, \u2018disproved\u2019, \u2018correct\u2019 and \u2018incorrect\u2019 in relation to your hypothesis, \nas it is unlikely that you can be this certain from a single investigation.

If your results contradict your predictions, this would warrant repeating the experiment, if you have time. If you cannot repeat the experiment, then your report should include a discussion of flaws in the design or method, and suggestions for how the investigation could be altered to minimise or eliminate these.\nConclusion\nThe main purpose of the conclusion  is to briefly summarise the position of the experiment \nin the wider understanding of the biological topic(s). You need to state the important overall \ntrend of the data (referring specifically to data from your results) and whether or not the results support the tested hypothesis. The conclusion should also assess whether the results of the experiment have contributed new information to what is known about the topic, and any further investigations that need to be undertaken. The conclusion should not introduce any information that has not already been discussed in the results and discussion section.\nFor example, in the experiment described in this chapter, the conclusion might read like this:\nIn conclusion, the results indicate that the optimal temperature of the catalase enzyme in \nlamb liver is 40\u00b0C as shown by the highest mean height of oxygen bubbles produced, 18.7 mm. This is compared to the predicted optimal temperature of 37\u00b0C, which produced an oxygen bubble height of only 16.5 mm. As such, the results do not support the hypothesis. However, whether this was completely true should be further explored by conducting the investigation at smaller increments of temperature, to find the exact optimal temperature.Conclusion \na summary of what you can deduce from the results of the investigation, including whether the tested hypothesis was supported\n524\nCHAPTER 12 SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS\n",

For example, if your experiment involved testing an increasing concentration of a solute solution, your results should start with the lowest concentration and continue to the highest concentration.\n \u2022If recording quantitative results, all values should have the same number of decimal points.\n \u2022Include results for all repeats in the table, and the mean (average) calculated for\u00a0these.\n \u2022Any results that are outliers should be recorded again (repeat the measurement). If there is no time to repeat the experiment, include the outliers but ignore them when \ncalculating the mean.\n \u2022Give the table an overall title. This should include mention of both the independent and dependent variables.\n \u2022In most cases, data from a table also needs to be displayed as a graph: a line graph for continuous data, a bar graph for discrete data.\nVIDEO 12B\u20131  \nSKILLS:  RECORDING RESULTS IN A  TABLE\n525 12B SCIENTI FIC EVIDENCE\n",

Their experiment confirmed that the survival of algae at different water depths was dependent on the algae\u2019s colour. Red algae, which contains a pigment  called phycoerythrin, allowed the algae to absorb more light in the green wavelength. This allowed the algae to survive at increased water depths compared to green algae, which contains the pigment chlorophyll and absorbed light of the blue and red wavelengths better.\n Like the previous researchers, Erin grew her own algal jelly balls, one set containing \ngreen algae and the other set containing red algae. She placed each of these groups of jelly balls into different test tubes and submerged them in a diluted sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (providing carbon dioxide and water to the algae).

You would have written up your planning stages and presented your results in a typical scientific report. While this is still done even at university, would you want to read a scientist\u2019s research presented to you in this way? Probably not. So scientists often communicate their findings in the form of a scientific poster. In the past few decades, posters have become a popular way to showcase new investigations and findings to the scientific community, nationally and internationally.\nProducing a scientific poster is a skill and is not as easy as you might think. It often \nrequires a lot of thought and preparation, as well as the ability to keep your ideas concise.\nEXPLAIN\nScientific poster template\nA key part of the School Assessed Coursework (SACs) in Units 3 and 4 Biology is a self-designed practical investigation presented as a poster, using the following template:\nTitle \nStudent name\nIntroduction\nMethodology and methodResultsCommunication statement \nreporting the key finding  of the investigation as a  one-sentence summaryDiscussion\nConclusion\nReferences and acknowledgements\nThis template is the same as the one provided in the VCAA Study Design. You\u2019ll notice \nfrom the template that the heading of each section correlates closely with the information that is recorded in your logbook from Sections 12A and 12B. This should therefore highlight the importance of the progression of information that is recorded there, as it will need to be transferred in a more succinct fashion onto your poster. The VCAA has also stipulated that this should not exceed 600 words. The centre of the poster occupies approximately one-quarter of the page and needs to be one sentence summarising the main outcomes of your investigation, thereby answering your investigation question (title). This should be as engaging as possible, to encourage any reader to want to read the other sections of your poster.VIDEO 12C\u20131 \nSCIENTIFIC POSTER EXAMPLE \n531 12C SCIENTIF IC COMM uNICATION\n",

Most of those in the scientific community prefer to have individual discussions with other experimenters about their work, rather than reading it from a poster. Talking about their work with others also gives the experimenter a chance to discuss aspects of their investigation that have not been included in the final presentation, and to answer any follow-up questions.\nTherefore, other methods for presenting the purpose and results of your investigation \ninclude oral presentation, multimedia presentation, visual representation or even an article for a scientific publication.

Their numbers decreased rapidly last century as their fur became a target for hunters, and then, as their habitats were destroyed or fragmented and predators increased, their numbers decreased even further. Consequently, this species became extinct in South Australia, and almost extinct in Victoria.\n To try to prevent koala extinction, small numbers of koalas were relocated to French Island (Victoria) and Kangaroo Island (South Australia). The conservation program was deemed successful as the populations increased in size.

Explain your  answer. \n (2 marks)\n22  Historically, a technique used to compare the similarity of a DNA sequence of different species was DNA hybridisation. This technique relies on heating the double-stranded DNA until it unwinds and the two strands separate (dissociate). When the temperature drops, two complementary strands will pair up again, due to hydrogen bonding between complementary nucleotides to re-form a double-stranded DNA molecule. The steps in this method are indicated below.\n Step 1  DNA is extracted from tissues of two species. The DNA is cut up using restriction enzymes to investigate a specific gene or region of a gene.\nSpecies 1\n Species 2\n549\nREVISION EXERCISE\n",
  "Page 562": " Step 2  The double-stranded DNA from each of the two species is separated by heating. \nThe temperature at which the DNA strands separate, known as the melting temperature or T\nm, is recorded.\n Step 3  The separated strands of the two species are then mixed together and will recombine to some extent as a hybrid DNA molecule. Pairing of the single \nstrands will occur where the two strands have complementary nucleotides. Where they are different, the strands will not pair up. Therefore, the greater the similarity between the DNA of the two organisms, the greater the level of hybridisation that will occur.\n Step 4  The level of similarity is measured by reheating the hybrid molecule. The T\nm needed to dissociate this hybrid DNA is recorded. When the degree of \ncomplementary base pairing is lower, there are fewer hydrogen bonds to break and therefore a lower temperature is required. The higher the temperature, the greater the similarity between the two species. It is assumed that the greater  the genetic similarity, the closer the two species are in evolutionary terms.\nEither\nHigh complementarity\nHigher TmLow complementarity\nLower TmOr\n In an experiment, scientists wanted to use DNA hybridisation to test whether humans were more closely related to chimpanzees or bonobo monkeys.\na  What are two controlled variables that would need to be considered in this experiment? \n (2 marks)\nb  What is the dependent variable in this experiment?

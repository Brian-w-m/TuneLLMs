  "Page 12": "1.1  Rules and laws\nLaw consists of rules that establish modes of behaviour and procedures. However, not all \nrules are laws. As members of the community , we are subject to a range of rules, non-legal and legal, which determine our relationship with other members of society . Not all the rules that govern our actions have the same effect, importance or repercussions.\nNon-legal rules\nNot all rules are legal. Groups within society have rules to set out how they interact, and to establish the rights and responsibilities of individual members of those groups. They are known as non-legal rules and they help reduce con\ufb02  ict within that particular group. These rules are not found in the law . They are established by norms, which are other sorts of rules.\nFor instance, within our families we are bound by rules of behaviour that set \nout the rights and responsibilities of each member. In a family the rules are clearly communicated, but not usually written. Clubs, sporting associations and schools also require rules to function smoothly . Such rules may be more formally stated than norms and may impose sanctions (penalties) on members who break them.\nARE RULES IN \nSPORT LAWS ?\nThe players in the Australian Football \nLeague are subject to complex rules. However, these rules are not legal rules. Although they are binding on all members of the league, they are not binding on the rest of us. If you decide to play football with the AFL you agree to abide by their rules. If you do not agree with these rules, you cannot play AFL football.\nIf an AFL player is charged with \nviolating the rules of the game, there is an AFL tribunal to settle the dispute. If a player is found guilty , they are punished, either by being suspended from playing for a speci\ufb01  c length of time or by being\u00a0\ufb01  ned.\nThese rules provide us with a guide to our interaction with other members of our \u2018group\u2019. \nThe nature of the rules will alter from group to group. You cannot be made to join a particular group, and therefore cannot be made to abide by its rules.\nIn many cases, rules are not formally stated or formally learnt. They are instilled in us \nby conditioning \u2013 this is what makes them norms. For example, there is no law stating that we must respect our parents; however, most of us do. We have learnt to behave in this manner since we were young. The value has been instilled in us by verbal and behavioural messages from our families, and perhaps by our religious beliefs.\nLegal rules\nLegal rules are known as laws. These laws set out our rights as members of the community . For instance, Human Rights and Equal Opportunity legislation establishes the\u00a0right of all individuals to be treated equally . The law also establishes our responsibilities to other members of the community or to the community as a whole. For\u00a0example, laws about the use of motor vehicles place responsibilities on all owners and\u00a0drivers of motor vehicles.Rules can be legal rules or \nnon-legal rules.\nNon-legal rules apply to a group but not to the community as a whole.\nLegal rules are laws that apply to the whole community. 4 Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 13": "In any society it is inevitable that there will be con\ufb02  icts. The law gives us ways of \nsettling these disputes peacefully . In Australia, the law provides a range of dispute \nsettlement institutions and processes. For instance, courts have been established to resolve disputes. The Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) was established to resolve disputes between individuals. VCAT and the courts resolve disputes using a range of processes. We will look at these processes in more detail later.\nFor laws to be established in a community , and to operate effectively , the authority of \nthose laws must be recognised by that community . This recognition is generally granted because the law re\ufb02  ects the collective needs and values of society . In Australia, the individual is encouraged to take an active role in the development of the legal system through a number of democratic processes: the electoral system, the provision of representative and responsible government, and the jury system.\nIn summary , the basic features of a law are that it:\n\u2022 speci\ufb01  es a particular behaviour or type of behaviour (it usually either prohibits or \nregulates that behaviour)\n\u2022 provides a sanction (penalty) or remedy against anyone who violates the law\u2022 is formed by an authority recognised by the community .\nFor example, the criminal law establishes expected behaviour by prohibiting certain \nactions. The criminal law is made by parliament, which is recognised by the community as having the authority to make the law for the community as a whole. If a person does something that has been prohibited by the criminal law , they will be punished by either having their liberty restricted or a \ufb01  ne imposed.\nSPORT  \u2013 DEFINING LEGAL AND \nNON-LEGAL RULES\nSome actions are only \npermitted within legally recognised games. For\u00a0instance, the sport of\u00a0boxing is strictly regulated and recognised organisations control boxing events. In a boxing match, punches are thrown with the intention of physical contact that may result in harm. Outside the boxing ring these same actions would come under legal rules, in particular the law of assault.\nA boxer who agrees \nto take part in a legally recognised boxing match consents to actions that would otherwise \nbe considered assault \u2013 provided that the match is conducted according to the rules of the sport of boxing. However, if a boxer were to continue the \ufb01  ght after the end of the match, that person would be acting outside the rules of the sport. In this case, the boxer may be subject to the legal rules of assault.\nThere can sometimes be a \ufb01  ne line between legal and non-legal rules. For instance, the AFL requires all \nplayers to agree to abide by the AFL rules (non-legal rules). However, the agreements made by professional players to play AFL football are contractual agreements (legal rules). Sometimes con\ufb02  icts may arise between how the AFL Tribunal applies the AFL rules and the principles of natural justice. In such cases, the courts may be asked to review decisions made by the AFL Tribunal.

  "Page 14": "1.2  A legal system\nLegal rules differ from non-legal rules in that legal rules apply to the community as a \nwhole. The legal system establishes procedures and institutions to make, administer, adjudicate and enforce the law in the community .\nIn our legal system, law-making is primarily the responsibility of the Commonwealth \nparliament and the State parliaments. Courts (judges and magistrates) are responsible for interpreting the law and resolving disputes when it is claimed that the law has been breached (adjudicating).\nA variety of bodies have been established to enforce the law . For instance, the police \nhave the power to impose on-the-spot \ufb01  nes and to arrest people suspected of having broken the law . The Department of Justice and Regulation is a government department responsible for the administration of justice. Individuals who need legal help use solicitors\u00a0and barristers, who advise them and may represent them in their dealings with\u00a0the legal system.\n1.3  Types of laws\nThe types of laws we have can be classi\ufb01  ed in a number of ways. Whatever method we \nuse, it is necessary to remember that, in a developed society such as ours, the law is complex and constantly changing. New areas of law , which may not neatly \ufb01  t into existing categories, develop. No one method of classi\ufb01  cation can cover all aspects of our law .\nBy looking at the different ways of classifying the law we can start to appreciate the \ncomplexity of our legal system. The methods used to classify our laws include:\n\u2022 criminal or civil law (classifying according to type of behaviour)\n\u2022 statute or common law (classifying according to the sources of law).\nIn Unit 3 we look at dispute settlement processes and procedures, and so we may want \nto classify the law according to the processes used to resolve disputes. Also, the dispute settlement processes and procedures differ according to whether they are for criminal or\u00a0civil cases (or according to the type of behaviour involved). In Unit 4 we look at the law-making process. For the purpose of our study in this section, we might want to classify the law according to the different processes used to make the law , or according to the sources of law .\nIn some cases, a wrongful act may involve more than one area of law . It may involve \nboth the rights of individuals and the relationship between the individual and the state.\nThis is often the case in car accidents. For instance, a speeding driver who fails to stop \nat a red light is guilty of a criminal offence. This behaviour constitutes a danger to the community as a whole. While driving through the red light the driver collides with another car. As a result of the collision, the second car has been damaged. The rights of the owner of the second car have been infringed. The driver of the second car could recover this loss through civil law by suing the other driver.\nCriminal or civil law\nLaws can be classi\ufb01  ed as either criminal or civil. Criminal law is concerned with behaviour that affects not only the individuals directly involved but also the welfare of society as a whole. Criminal law aims to regulate the behaviour of individuals as members\u00a0of the community and to protect the interests of society . Civil law is concerned with behaviour between one individual and another individual. It includes contract law and the law of torts.\nTypes of criminal laws\nCriminal law is generally concerned with behaviour that is disruptive to the society as a whole. Some of the types of criminal offences are set out in the table on the following\u00a0page.Laws can be classi/f_i  ed \naccording to the source or the type of behaviour regulated.\nLaws can be classi/f_i  ed as either criminal/uni00A0or civil. 6 Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

Contract law is concerned with legally \nenforceable agreements made between individuals (a company , legally , is an individual, so this includes agreements made between one person and a company). Torts are concerned with the wrongful actions of one individual towards another individual. Some of the types of torts are set out in the following table.\nTable 1.2 Types of torts\nTypes of torts\nNegligence Nuisance Defamation Trespass\nTypes of torts Defi  nitions\nNegligence Where the actions of an individual who has failed to exercise reasonable \ncare adversely affects another individual\nNuisance Where an individual interferes with another\u2019s enjoyment of their rights\nDefamation Where an individual damages the good name or reputation of another through false or misleading statements\nTrespass Where an individual physically interferes with another person, their goods or/uni00A0their land\nIt is important to understand the difference between the two types of behaviour. Criminal \nlaw and civil law are dealt with by different procedures and have different consequences for the individuals involved. Criminal law is enforced by the police, the courts and Corrections Victoria. An individual who has been charged with a criminal offence will be prosecuted by the state, not by the individual who has been harmed, and, if found guilty of an offence, will be sanctioned. Sanctions are generally a \ufb01  ne, a community correction order or imprisonment.\nCivil law is concerned with the enforcement of an individual\u2019s rights. In civil law , the \nindividual affected by a breach of their legal rights is responsible for taking the case to court. If their case is successful, the court may award monetary compensation or issue a court order to stop any further infringement.\nCriminal law and civil \nlaw are dealt with using different procedures.

  "Page 17": "Statute or common law\nThere are two sources of law in Australia.\n\u2022 Parliaments are responsible for making \nstatute law . Statute law is also referred to as\u00a0legislation \u2013 Acts of Parliament. Parliaments may also delegate their law-making powers to other bodies, known as \u2018subordinate authorities\u2019. The\u00a0rules made by these bodies are known as \u2018regulations\u2019, \u2018orders-in-council\u2019 and \u2018local laws\u2019.\n\u2022 Courts also have responsibility for \nthe development of the law , either through the\u00a0process of interpreting the meaning of statutes as they apply to individual cases\u00a0or through the declaration of common law . This is sometimes known as judge-made\u00a0law.\nWe discuss these two sources of law in more detail in Unit 4.\n1.4  Why do we need laws?\nThe main function of law is to enable individuals to live peacefully together. Laws \nallow individuals to work cooperatively towards meeting their needs for the bene\ufb01  t of all members of the community . This is a concept known as social cohesion. The term \u2018cohesion\u2019 means the act of uniting or sticking together. Laws aim to \u2018unite\u2019 or \u2018stick\u2019 society together.\nTo achieve social cohesion the law needs to be recognised or acknowledged by the \ncommunity . The community will recognise the authority of the law if it:\n\u2022 sets out the expected behaviour of individual members\n\u2022 provides a means by which disputes can be resolved\u2022 re\ufb02  ects the values of the majority of the community\u2022 provides a means for changing the law .\nEstablishing expected behaviour\nThe law helps keep society together by prohibiting conduct that is disruptive. Prohibitions \ninclude laws about aggressive behaviour, the use of property and the use of roads. These \nmatters are all regulated by the criminal law . To ensure that members of society abide by its rules, society imposes punishments (sanctions) on those who violate them. We look at this in more detail in Chapter 4.\nThe rights of individuals are contained in the civil law . For example, the tort of \nnegligence protects the rights of individuals to be free from harm that may result from the careless actions of others. Where the rights of individuals have been violated, the law provides for a range of remedies: the aim is generally to restore the individual to their original position.\nThere is an array of remedies, because monetary compensation is not appropriate \nin all circumstances. For example, the law provides for court injunctions or orders that require an individual to behave in a particular manner. Remedies provided in civil cases are examined in more detail in Chapter 5.\nBy stating the rights and responsibilities of individuals and society , the law makes \nexplicit the boundaries of behaviour. So each individual can know what is expected and how to plan their interactions with other members of society .Australia\u2019s two sources of \nlaw are parliament and the/uni00A0courts.\nParliament Courts\n(judge-made law)\nStatute\nLegislation\nActs of\nParliamentStatutory\ninterpretation\nCommon law \nFigure 1.1 Sources of law\nLaws provide for social cohesion in our/uni00A0community.\nWe need laws to establish expected behaviour.

  "Page 18": "Resolving disputes\nThe law is necessary to provide for peaceful dispute resolution. Life in society would \nbe impossible if each individual was free to resolve a dispute by any method. The law \nestablishes a range of dispute settlement bodies to deal with disputes that may arise in the community . These dispute settlement bodies include courts and tribunals.\nRefl  ecting values\nOne common element in all legal systems is the reliance of law on a set of values that are shared by that society . These values are a collection of beliefs and attitudes about what is right or good. The values that are shared by the community form the basis of what is right or good in law . These values form the basis of the principles of justice.\nThroughout the world, religious beliefs have strongly in\ufb02  uenced the development of \nlaw . Australia is a diverse community consisting of numerous religious, cultural and ethnic groups. While there are some different values in different groups, there are some values that are shared. For example, the value that we place on human life is upheld by the majority of people in our community . The law upholds this value by making it an offence to take another person\u2019s life (murder). The law also recognises that there are some circumstances in which it may be excusable to take another\u2019s life. The right of each individual to use reasonable force for self-protection is recognised by the laws relating to self-defence.We need laws to resolve \ndisputes.\nWe need laws that re/f_l  ect the shared values of the community.\nAUSTRALIA  \u2013 A LAND OF MANY\u00a0HISTORIES\nAustralia is a land of many histories. There is the \n\ufb01  rst history of its occupation by its Indigenous people, which stretches back 40,000 to 60,000 years. That occupation is re\ufb02  ected in the art, the songs, the stories and ceremonies, the laws and traditions and the language of the people themselves which created and conveyed, from generation to generation, knowledge about the country and the way in which members of Indigenous societies should deal with each\u00a0other.\nThe second history is that of the British \ncolonisers, dating back to the late 18th century , and their successors, who brought with them the common law of England and the concept of the Rule of Law , developed the legal systems of the colonies and, ultimately , the Commonwealth Constitution and the legal institutions which are part of our contemporary societal infrastructure\u00a0today .\nThe third of our histories is that of the migrants \nwho have come to Australia over the past 50\u00a0years or so, creating a multi-ethnic society composed of people from 180 different countries. Something like 46% of all Australians today were either born overseas or have at least one parent born overseas.\nThe history of Australia\u2019s \ufb01  rst people looms \nover the other two.\nJustice French, speaking at the National \nIndigenous Legal Conference\nTraditional law forms a part of the complex system \nof rules that govern the rights and responsibilities of Indigenous people in Australia. The Aboriginal system of law \u2013 customary or traditional law \u2013 contains some sophisticated elements. For instance, it\u00a0allows informality in dispute settlement, conciliation procedures, and participation in the administration of justice, and stresses the rehabilitation of offenders.\nSuch dispute settlement methods are still evolving \nin more developed legal systems. Although European contact has lessened their in\ufb02  uence in many regions, some Indigenous groups in isolated areas still follow the traditional way of life. Aboriginal law is both sacred and secular. Sacred law is considered the more important, and involves many secret rites. Sacred law is linked to the Aboriginal concept of the Dreamtime, and many aspects of this have not been revealed to non-Aboriginal people. Secular law is the body of rules members of an Indigenous community are expected to comply with.\nTraditional Indigenous groups have lawmen who \nare responsible for the interpretation of the sacred law . Sacred law imposes additional sanctions in matters such as theft, assault and adultery . The Elders of the community have considerable authority , and the council of elders is the community\u2019s leadership group. The Pitjantjatjara are one such community , consisting of about 4000 people spread over the Northern Territory , Western Australia and South Australia. They believe that their sacred law has always existed and will exist until the end of time.\nThe strength of the Aboriginal legal system can be \nseen in the fact that it has bound the many Aboriginal peoples, as separate groups and together, and maintained a stable lifestyle for more than 40,000 years.\nThere has been ongoing debate about the extent \nto which traditional or customary law should be recognised. 10 Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

Although 30 years have elapsed since the report was published, its recommendations have, by and large, been ignored.\nFew in Australia understand the context and true meaning of customary law. Denials \nof its validity/uni00A0are often based on ignorance or on speci/f_i  c examples devoid of context; the severity of \u2018spearing\u2019 , for example, as being contrary to human rights/uni00A0norms.\nThis is akin to rejecting the common law based solely on, say, the use of lethal injections \nto execute prisoners in the United/uni00A0States.\nAJ Wood, from www.theconversation.com\nIt is dif\ufb01  cult for the law to preserve the values of all members of society . In order for us to \nlive together as a group, it is necessary for the law to uphold the values that are dominant. For example, the rules on marriage vary from one religion to another. However, the Marriage Act 1961 (Cth) de\ufb01  nes marriage as the union of one man and one woman. In Australia, only monogamous, heterosexual marriages are legally binding. This does not necessarily re\ufb02  ect the values of all groups or individuals. Many people strongly disagree with the idea that marriage can exist only between one man and one woman and have called for the law to change.\nThe law re\ufb02  ects a variety of values such as,:\n\u2022 the way in which members of society relate to others (social values)\u2022 the fundamental beliefs about right and wrong (moral values)\u2022 the rights of individuals in the economic system (economic values)\u2022 the rights of individuals in the organisation of our legal system (political values).\nHow a country interprets these values will vary .In 2017 the Marriage \nLaw Postal Survey asked Australians for their views on same-sex marriage.

Those breaking this law face a \n/f_i  ne and/or citizenship education.\nA ban on hijabs in France\u2019s public schools was \nadopted in the 2003\u201304 school year. President Jacques Chirac said such a law was needed to protect the French principle of secularism. The French believe that secularism, or the separation of church and state, is the cornerstone of the modern French state. So important is this principle that it is guaranteed by the French Constitution (Article 1):\nFrance shall be an indivisible, secular, democratic and social Republic. It shall ensure the equality of all citizens before the law, without distinction of origin, race or religion. It shall respect all beliefs.\nGiven that the French Constitution also guarantees respect for all beliefs, it may be surprising to discover that France banned the wearing of religious apparel and signs that \u2018conspicuously show\u2019 a student\u2019s religious a\ufb03   liation. While Jewish kippas and large Christian crosses would also be banned, the law was more directly aimed at removing Islamic hijabs from classrooms in state-run public schools. The Council of State, France\u2019s highest administrative body, said hijabs should be banned only when they are of an \u2018ostentatious character\u2019 . The judgment as to when a hijab is \u2018ostentatious in character\u2019 is left to the school.\nThe same rules apply to the kippa and Christian \ncruci/f_i  x. There have been no reported cases where schools have questioned the wearing of kippas or \u2018ostentatious\u2019 crosses, but every year there are about 150 complaints involving hijabs. These complaints are heard by mediators and, if unresolved, can lead to expulsion of the student/s. These laws do not apply to private schools.This approach to de/f_i  ning secularism in France is not \nnew. Since 1905, France has enforced a legal separation of church and state. A century ago, in the name of secularism, France removed cruci/f_i  xes hanging in its classrooms. Crosses were even forbidden on co\ufb03   ns during funeral processions. The removal of cruci/f_i  xes was seen as necessary, as it symbolised the separation of the state from the Roman Catholic Church.\nThere has been growing concern in France over \nother demands seen to challenge the notion of the secular state. Muslim groups have been seeking segregated classrooms for boys and girls and the recognition of Muslim holy days in school calendars, and some students have refused to take oral exams with examiners of the opposite sex.\nHow the law de/f_i  nes religious freedoms within a \nsecular state is an issue faced in many democracies. In September 2016 Bulgaria banned women from wearing full-face veils in public. In the same year Switzerland enforced a ban on the full-face veil and women wearing a burka could face a /f_i  ne of almost \u20ac10,000. In 2015 The Netherlands approved a partial ban on the full-face veil. Full veils cannot be worn in schools, hospitals or on public transport. Since 2011 Belgium has banned the full-face veil. In contrast, Syria lifted a ban on teachers wearing the Islamic veil in/uni00A02011.\nIn Great Britain and Sweden, value is placed on \nmulticulturalism (becoming British, or Swedish, but also maintaining the cultural traditions of the lands you came from, or your family came from) rather than assimilation (becoming British or Swedish by, in part, giving up the cultural traditions of one\u2019s homeland, or one\u2019s family\u2019s homeland). This is similar to the approach taken in Australia.\nWHAT FRENCH LAW  SAYS ON \nSECULARISM AND RELIGIOUS \nCLOTHING\n \u00b7In 2010, France became the \ufb01  rst European country to ban the full-face veil in\u00a0public.\n \u00b7A 2004 law forbids the wearing of religious emblems in schools and colleges. This \nincludes Islamic headscarves (known as hijabs), Jewish caps (known as kippas) and large Christian\u00a0crosses.\n \u00b7In 1905, a law was passed that aimed to separate church and state. That law of separation guaranteed freedom of religion, and built on earlier laws enshrining secularism in education. No reference was made to\u00a0clothing.

It comes from the Latin term \u2018jus\u2019 meaning right or law . \nOften justice is de\ufb01  ned in the community in terms of what is right, good or ethical.\nJustice can be viewed in two ways:\n\u2022 Social justice \u2013 based on the concepts of human rights and equality , and fairness in \nthe distribution of wealth and opportunities\n\u2022 Procedural justice \u2013 fairness in the processes used to resolve disputes, and access \nto dispute resolution processes.The legal system provides \nways to change the law.\nWHAT ARE THE SYMBOLS  OF\u00a0JUSTICE?\nJustice has been symbolised by the \ufb01  gure of a woman holding \nscales in one hand and a sword in the other. This image can be traced back to the ancient Roman images of Justice. She was often\u00a0portrayed carrying scales, a sword, and wearing a blindfold.\nThe Blindfold\nThe blindfold is a symbol of \u2018blind justice\u2019. This represents the concept that justice must include equality , which means treating all\u00a0people equally .\nThe Scales\nThe scales of justice represent the fact that justice must balance the\u00a0needs of the individual against the needs of society . Justice must\u00a0also balance the interests of one individual against those of another. The scales of justice symbolise fairness.\nThe Sword\nThe sword of justice is a symbol of power and authority . It is a double-edged sword, meaning that it can be wielded either for\u00a0or\u00a0against each party .\n\u2018Justice\u2019 describes a set of values or principles. Throughout history there have been \ndifferent opinions as to what these values or principles are. However, common principles have been identi\ufb01  ed. These common principles include concepts such as fairness, equality and the ability to access the legal system.\nThe legal system can only operate effectively if it has the support of the majority of \npeople in the community . People will support the legal system if they believe that it will provide justice.\n 14 Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

In other words, a person cannot make a decision when they have a \ufb01  nancial, or other, interest in the outcome, or any known bias that might affect their impartiality . Second, we should always \u2018hear the other side\u2019. In other words, the person directly affected by a decision must be given a fair opportunity to state their case and to know the allegations against them. In Chapter 3 we will discuss the processes and procedures we use to ensure fairness in criminal cases. In Chapter 5 we explore the processes and procedures for fairness in civil disputes.\nEquality\nThe principle of equality is considered fundamental to the achievement of justice in \na democracy . The justice system strives to achieve equality by treating all individuals equally . This does not mean that all individuals are treated in exactly the same manner. It\u00a0means that the system recognises the value, ability and merit of all individuals. A\u00a0justice system that provides for equal treatment is a justice system that is even-handed or balanced in its treatment of all people.\nThe law recognises that there are differences between individuals. It acknowledges \nthese differences, and provides all individuals with an equal opportunity to exercise their rights. This means that it is sometimes necessary to establish special procedures or facilities to help particular individuals. For example, the law provides for special procedures to allow vulnerable witnesses to give evidence in criminal cases.\nWHAT IS EQUALITY ?\nThere is a close relationship between the principle of equality and the ideal of \njustice. However, the principle of equality can be interpreted in many ways. Listed below are eight different interpretations of the term \u2018equality\u2019.\n\u2018TO EACH THE SAME THING\u2019\nThis means that every person in society gets an identical or equal\u00a0share.\n\u2018TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS MERITS\u2019\nA person who is deserving of praise should receive better recognition and advancement in life.\n\u2018TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS WORKS\u2019\nThose who work harder for the bene\ufb01  t of society , or the advancement of the collective wealth, should receive more.\n\u2018TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS NEEDS\u2019\nSociety ought to distribute bene\ufb01  ts according to the individual needs of each\u00a0person.\n\u2018TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS RANK\u2019\nThe recognition of rank and position is important to a society .\n\u2018TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS LEGAL ENTITLEMENT\u2019\nThe law of the community lays down our entitlement to bene\ufb01  ts and privileges.\n\u2018TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS FITNESS\u2019\nThe bene\ufb01  ts that each individual receives should be decided according to their\u00a0abilities.\n\u2018TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS POSITION\u2019\nBene\ufb01  ts cannot be distributed equally to all people.

  "Page 24": "Access\nAccess to the law and legal institutions is essential if justice is to be achieved. Access \nincludes being able to get appropriate legal advice, assistance and legal representation. It also means that there are processes and procedures for the determination of criminal cases or civil claims and legal institutions such as courts and tribunals for those processes to occur in.\nACCESSING JUSTICE\nAccess to justice goes beyond courts and lawyers \n(although these are important). It incorporates \neverything people do to try to resolve the disputes they have, including accessing information and support to prevent, identify and resolve disputes.\nThis broad view of access to justice recognises \nthat many people resolve disputes without going to court, and sometimes without seeking professional assistance.\nThere are three levels of justice:1 Most disputes are resolved using everyday \njustice: by avoiding con\ufb02  ict and managing \ndisputes.\n2 The second most common form of resolving a \ndispute is through informal justice \u2013 such as using a third party adviser or facilitator.\n3 The least common form of resolving a dispute \nis through the formal justice system, including courts and tribunals, often with a lawyer.\nfrom the website of the Australian Attorney General\u2019s DepartmentResolving disputes through \nthe courts and tribunals, often \nwith a lawyer.Resolving disputes with \nthe assistance of a third \nparty adviser or facilitator.Avoiding con/f_lict \nand managing \ndisputes.Everyday\njustice\nInformal\njustice\nFormal\njusticeProportion of disputes resolved\nA broader interpretation of the term \u2018access to justice\u2019 may include:\n\u2022 the equal ability of all people in the community to access the processes to enforce \nexisting rights or laws\n\u2022 equal access for all minority groups in the community to all the legal rights enjoyed \nby the majority of people in the community .\nTHE CONCEPT  OF JUSTICE\nThere are many interpretations of the word \u2018justice\u2019.

  "Page 25": "  Legal brief 1.1  \nWhat does \u2018justice\u2019 mean?\nAs a supreme interpreter of justice in the legal system, \nthe Chief Justice of Victoria, the Hon. Marilyn Warren AC, in her 2014 Newman lecture, explored the question \u2018What is justice?\u2019 She believes that for different people at different times, justice means different things:\nTo the ordinary person, \u2018justice\u2019 will often mean \ndue punishment when a criminal is sentenced for a/uni00A0crime.\nTo the popular media, \u2018justice\u2019 will generally mean \nharsh punishment, primarily focused on a strong retribution and deterrence.\nThen there is a notion of social justice to be \ncompared with legal justice \u2026 In this sense, the concept of justice is merged with factors of equality, opportunity and equity.\nShe added:\nJustice is not solely about justice between the parties in a court case. It is also about justice to/uni00A0society.\nFor justice in Australia to function, there must be fairness, \nequality and access.\nFairness\nThe principles of justice and fairness can be regarded as the rules of fair play.\nJustice Warren says that:\nTo the accused person, justice means fairness: a \nfair hearing, a fair sentence that punishes not too harshly and offers hope \u2026\nTo the lawyer, justice means the application of the \nrule of law; that is, the certainty of applying legal rules developed over centuries to resolve disputes between citizens and between the citizen and the/uni00A0state.\nTo the judge, justice is the application of the rule of \nlaw without fear or favour, affection or ill-will.\nEquality\nFor an equitable system, there must be equality. \nThere/uni00A0must be equality of access for the underprivileged. At the same time, we should aim for equality of outcomes, by addressing the barriers faced by those trying to access the judicial system.\nIn Australia, equal pay, land rights and reconciliation \nemphasise the role of equality in the legal system. Chief Justice Warren noted:\nIt is said to be \u2018unjust\u2019 that some in society are \nhomeless, receive a different standard of education or are unable to access necessary healthcare. In/uni00A0this sense, the concept of justice is merged with factors of equality, opportunity and equity.\nShe saw the Mabo land rights case as highlighting the \nimportance of equality. The successful /f_i  ght by women for equal pay is another illustration.\n  Former Chief \nJustice/uni00A0Warren\nAccess\nAccess to justice means different things to different \npeople. It represents the formal ability to appear in court.\nA broader de/f_i  nition of access to justice encompasses the \nneed to advocate for people who cannot afford lawyers, and also focuses on the inadequacies and limitations of the legal aid system.\nThe Productivity Commission conducted an inquiry into \naccess to justice. The inquiry found:\n \u00b7widespread concerns that the civil justice system is too slow, too expensive and too adversarial\n \u00b7that where disputes become intractable, many people are unnecessarily deterred by fears about costs and/or have dif/f_i  culty in identifying whether and where to seek assistance\n \u00b7that reforms to professional regulation are needed to ensure that clients are better informed and have more options in terms of selecting the tasks they want assistance with, and how they will be billed\n \u00b7that more action is needed to reduce court costs and the length of litigation\n \u00b7that changes to rules governing the conduct of the parties to a case, and of lawyers, and the way costs are awarded, would improve the resolution of/uni00A0disputes\n \u00b7that disadvantaged people are more susceptible to, and less equipped to deal with, legal disputes: more resources are required to better meet the needs of disadvantaged people, and government-funded legal assistance services generate net bene/f_i  ts to the/uni00A0community\n \u00b7that in some cases, legal aid funding should be redirected.\nThe Federal Government adopted a number of the \nrecommendations.\n  Chapter 1 Law and justice: an introduction 17\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 26": "NEWSREPORT  1.4 \nWhat limits justice?\nTHE LEGAL SYSTEM IS NOT PERFECT. IT REFLECTS  \nthe range of individual di\ufb00  erences that exist within \nour community. The e\ufb00  ectiveness of the legal system can be limited by economic decisions about the allocation of resources, political decisions about the implementation of social policies, or the ignorance and prejudice of members of the community.\nMany believe that the legal system is expensive, \nplagued by delays and intimidating for the average person. The success of alternative methods of dispute resolution (ADR) illustrates that alternatives that o\ufb00  er a faster, cheaper, simpler resolution to disputes are popular.\nA legal system should be just, fair, comprehensible, \ncertain and reasonably expeditious. In criminal matters the/uni00A0law needs to balance the need to protect the innocent/uni00A0(not only from crime but also from wrongful conviction) at the same time as securing convictions.\nLimited knowledge\nUnder the English common law tradition, there is an expectation that all people are treated as equal before the law. Consistent with this is an expectation that courts, tribunals and dispute resolution methods should be equally accessible to all. However, a number of factors limit access to courts and dispute resolution. Most members of the community have limited knowledge of the operation of the legal system and their rights. It is di\ufb03   cult to exercise your rights e\ufb00  ectively unless you have some understanding of what those rights may be. The courts can only enforce rights where individuals bring a matter to/uni00A0the court.\nLegal costs\nThere is a generally held view that dispute resolution through the courts is costly and should be avoided. For many people, involvement in a legal case is a once-in-a-lifetime event. In most instances this will be in relation to a/uni00A0minor o\ufb00  ence, a minor claim or as a prospective juror.\nThe tension between access to justice and legal costs is \nnot new. Although we regard justice as a right, it is a right that must be paid for. Legal services are costly. This is not to say that the costs of legal services are unreasonable. The/uni00A0costs charged re/f_l  ect the costs of o\ufb00  ering the service of legal advice, in much the same manner as the service fees charged by a doctor may re/f_l  ect the costs of running that business.Limited legal aid\nAccess to the legal system is essential if the system is to achieve justice. The legal system recognises that costs may prohibit some people from exercising their rights. Legal aid schemes have been established to assist in these cases. However, these schemes have been criticised as leaving only the poorest with representation. It has been suggested that as a consequence it is only the very rich or very poor who have access to the legal system.\nImpact of delays\nA feature of particular concern to the legal system is delays. Delays can occur for a number of reasons in the stages leading up to a hearing. Such delays are largely in the hands of the parties, although in recent times the courts have taken greater control of the pre-trial exchanges between the parties. Some delays in the hearing of a case may be due not to the actions of the parties, but to a lack of court time or judges.\nDelays also occur in the enforcement of criminal law. \nIf/uni00A0an accused person is refused bail and there are delays in the preparation of the case for hearing, then an innocent person may have lost their liberty. Delays in criminal matters have serious consequences in terms of basic civil rights. One-third of those held on remand do not receive a jail sentence. They may be acquitted or granted a non-custodial sentence. However, during the remand period they have had their liberty denied. The right of an individual to be considered innocent until proven guilty is clearly compromised by the need to protect the community from someone who may be an o\ufb00  ender.\nDi\ufb03   culties faced by migrant groups\nThe di\ufb03   culties faced by individuals in accessing justice are compounded for members of the community who have recently migrated to Australia or who belong to an ethnic minority group. A migrant may be faced with a number of problems in their dealings with the Australian legal system. They may have di\ufb03   culty in understanding Australian English. Even if they have a good understanding of English, they may /f_i  nd understanding the language of the law particularly di\ufb03   cult. Furthermore, many migrant groups would be unfamiliar with the operation of an English legal system and would therefore /f_i  nd an adversarial trial di\ufb03   cult to understand. 18 Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

  "Page 32": "2.1   The principles of justice in the \ncriminal justice system\nThe Victorian criminal justice system seeks to achieve both social justice and procedural \njustice. Both the accused and victims of crime should have a sense that justice has been \nachieved. We do this in part by ensuring that their human rights are upheld in criminal proceedings. Additionally , the criminal justice system must ensure that the procedures that are followed during pre-trial, trial and post-trial are just for all involved.\nFor example, the Criminal Procedure Act 2009 (Vic) sets out the processes that must \nbe used in criminal cases in the Magistrates\u2019 Court, County Court and Supreme Court in Victoria in order to achieve fairness and equality in the running of criminal matters. The principles of justice in the criminal justice system encapsulate notions of fairness, equality and access.\nFairness\nAs discussed in Chapter 1, fairness is based upon the concept of \u2018fair play\u2019. In the \nVictorian criminal justice system, it is important that the principle of natural justice (also known as procedural fairness) is upheld. Natural justice includes the rule against bias and the right to a fair hearing.\nThe rule against bias\nIn a criminal matter, the judge or magistrate presiding over the hearing or trial must not make a decision that is the result of either actual bias or an apprehension (suspicion) of\u00a0bias.\nActual bias\nActual bias means that there is evidence that the judge or magistrate prejudged the matter or that prejudice affected their decision-making.\nIn criminal pre-trial procedures (such as a bail application or committal proceedings), \nduring a criminal hearing or trial, or post-trial (such as at sentencing), a judge or magistrate must rely only upon the evidence at hand in their decision-making role and not prejudge the matter. A judge or magistrate cannot allow a personal prejudice or opinion to affect their decision (such as whether the accused is guilty or not guilty).\nApprehension of bias\nAn apprehension of bias means that it looks as if the decision-maker has allowed a bias to \naffect their decision. That is, there is an appearance of bias, rather than evidence of bias.\nA fi  nding of apprehended bias means that a fair and objective observer might \nreasonably conclude that the judge or magistrate did not approach the matter with an open mind (if it appears that the judge or magistrate had already made up his or her mind about the length of a prison sentence, without listening to the mitigating factors presented in court, for instance).\nApprehended bias is easier to establish than actual bias, because it is focused upon \nappearances. Tests for both kinds of bias have developed through the common law .\nThe hearing rule\nThe hearing rule achieves fairness by ensuring that the judge or magistrate informs the \nperson of the case against them and gives them an opportunity to be heard.\nIt would be unfair for the court to give the prosecution the opportunity to present their \ncase against the accused, but to not allow the accused to respond to the allegations. The hearing rule has mostly developed through the common law .\nIn a criminal trial, the accused is able to present their case through their defence \nteam:\u00a0they can present evidence and call witnesses and use examination in chief, cross-examination and re-examination.Both the accused and a \nvictim of crime are entitled to justice.\nThe principles of justice in the criminal justice system are fairness, equality and access.\nNatural justice (or procedural fairness) includes the rule against bias and the right to a fair/uni00A0hearing.\nA judge or magistrate cannot allow actual bias, or an apprehension of bias, to impact upon any decision.\nActual bias is when there \nis evidence that bias has affected a decision.\nAn apprehension of bias is when it appears that bias has occurred.\nThe hearing rule ensures that a party is given the chance to present their side of the case. 24 Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 33": "Equality\nThe criminal justice system seeks to achieve equality by treating the accused and victims \nof crime uniformly . Legislation governing criminal procedures and the presentation of \nevidence, such as the Criminal Procedure Act 2009 (Vic) and the Evidence Act 2008 (Vic), \nare examples of laws that have been enacted in order to provide clear parameters for the running of a criminal hearing or trial in order to ensure that participants are treated equally . The criminal justice system also strives to treat victims equally , through the Victims\u2019 Charter Act 2006 (Vic).\nVulnerable participants\nNot all individuals enter the criminal justice system on an equal footing. Sometimes, the criminal justice system needs to use specialised procedures and facilities to ensure that people are adequately assisted. For example, the treatment of victims sometimes needs to be tailored to address the specifi  c characteristics of certain types of victims. Victims who are classifi  ed as vulnerable witnesses (such as children, people with a cognitive impairment, victims of sexual assault, and victims of family violence) may be able to give their evidence under special conditions in order to minimise the additional distress that they may feel in a court situation.\nVictims also generally have the right to be informed of the status of proceedings, but \nthis is assessed on a case-by-case basis.\nCultural differences\nCultural differences also need to be addressed by the criminal justice system. Indigenous offenders, for example, may qualify to have their matter heard in a Koori Court, depending upon a number of factors. This aims to redress the inequality that some Indigenous people feel when facing a criminal justice system that does not include the involvement of an Indigenous elder. For further information on the operation of the Koori Court, see Chapter\u00a03.\nAdditional services, such as the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service, are also available \nto address the specifi  c needs of accused Indigenous persons. For more information on the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service, see Chapter 3.The criminal justice system \nseeks to achieve equality by treating participants uniformly.\nSome participants in the criminal justice system need to be assisted with specialised procedures and facilities.\nInequalities between different cultural groups in society often need to be addressed by the criminal justice system.

  "Page 34": "Access\nAccess to the criminal justice system involves two key perspectives. Individuals charged \nwith an offence may be signifi  cantly disadvantaged if they do not have access to legal representation and advice. Such representation and advice is costly , so access to fi  nancial assistance is essential to achieving justice. Second, both an accused and the victim need access to information.\nAccess to financial assistance\nAccess to the criminal justice system can be particularly problematic for those who \ncannot afford the escalating fi  nancial costs of legal assistance. In a criminal matter, it can be very costly to obtain legal advice and to maintain legal representation throughout the hearing or trial. Access to legal advice and assistance can be especially diffi  cult for an accused charged with an indictable offence, as the pre-trial, trial, and post-trial procedures take considerable time, which means increased costs.\nVictoria Legal Aid\u2019s (VLA\u2019s) role is to help accused persons achieve justice by \nproviding legal representation to those who qualify . Persons charged with a crime who apply to Victoria Legal Aid need to meet relatively strict means and merits tests in order to obtain assistance. This ensures that the limited resources of VLA, who are funded by the government, are directed to and utilised by those who are most in need. For more information about VLA see Chapter 3.\nAccess to information\nMore broadly , access to information is important to both an accused and a victim of crime. For an accused, it is important to have access to the details of the case that the prosecution is making.\nFor example, before committal proceedings, the accused and his or her legal \nrepresentative need to have access to a copy of the hand-up brief. A hand-up brief contains details of the allegation, including witness statements and the defendant\u2019s record of interview . This ensures that the defendant is aware of the allegations. The rights of an accused are discussed in more detail later in this chapter.\nIt is also important that a victim of crime feels a sense of justice, and having access to \ncertain information is part of that. A victim has a general right to access information about the status of an investigation, subject to the progress and needs of the investigation, and to obtain certain details about the offender, such as their release date. Victims who qualify can receive additional access to information about the offender from the victims\u2019 register. The rights of victims are discussed in more detail later in this chapter.The high cost of the \ncriminal justice system can affect an individual\u2019s ability to gain proper access.\nVictoria Legal Aid aims to help those who qualify to gain better access to legal advice and legal representation within the criminal justice system.\nAccess to information is important for participants in the criminal justice system. 26 Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 35": "2.2   Key concepts in the criminal \njustice system\nBroadly defi  ned, a crime is an act or omission committed against the community at large \nthat is punishable by the law . A person suspected of committing a criminal offence is prosecuted by the state. There are generally two elements that need to be present before an act or omission can be called a crime: a guilty act (actus reus) and a guilty mind (mens rea). An exception to this is a \u2018strict liability\u2019 crime: where the wrongful act alone establishes the crime \u2013 speeding is an example of a strict liability crime.\nThe purposes of criminal law\nThe purposes of criminal law include punishing the offender and protecting the community . Offenders convicted of a crime are punished by a sanction which is given by the court. These purposes need to be balanced with upholding the rights of the accused.\nTypes of criminal offences\nThere are two main types of criminal offences: summary offences and indictable \noffences. Summary offences are less serious crimes, such as traffi  c offences. These are heard in the Magistrates\u2019 Court before a magistrate. Indictable offences are more serious offences, such as murder. These are heard in the County Court or Supreme Court by a judge and 12 jurors.\nSome indictable offences can be tried summarily . This means that a magistrate in \nthe Magistrates\u2019 Court can hear and determine some indictable offences, such as theft and burglary , if the accused gives his or her consent. There are Magistrates\u2019 Courts in numerous metropolitan and country locations.\nSpeeding is a summary offenceMost crimes require \ntwo elements to be established: the mens rea/uni00A0and the actus reus.\nCriminal offences are either summary offences or indictable offences. Some indictable offences can be tried summarily.

This is known as the burden of proof. The burden of proof (or onus of proof) rests with the prosecution in a criminal case. This is thought to be fair, because the party making the allegations should have to prove them.\nAlthough it is rare, some Acts of Parliament reverse the burden of proof and place the \nonus on the defendant. Examples at the Commonwealth level include some terrorism and drug offences. Some argue that reversing the burden of proof undermines the principle of the presumption of innocence.In a criminal matter, the \nburden of proof generally rests with the prosecution. 30 Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

In the UK, it \nis referred to as \u2018the golden thread of English criminal law\u2019 . It is the burden of proof (the degree of evidence that is required to prove a case), where the prosecution/uni00A0in criminal trials \u2013 even tra\ufb03   c o\ufb00  ences \u2013 has to prove the cases \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 . It is common law, centring around the right to a fair trial.\nThe prosecution usually bears the legal burden \nof proving the alleged crime \u2013 and disproving any defence. However, the burden of proof can be reversed in trials concerning terrorism, drug o\ufb00  ences, child sex o\ufb00  enders, unmarked plastic explosives, copyright, taxation o\ufb00  ences, and other matters such as bail.\nWith drug o\ufb00  ences, the Criminal Code contains \ndeeming provisions. These include when a person is found to be dealing with a threshold \u2018tra\ufb03   cable\u2019 quantity of a controlled drug: in this situation the person is deemed or presumed to have either the intention to tra\ufb03   c or cultivate for a commercial purpose, or the intention to commercially manufacture.The main reason for these laws is to make it easier \nto prosecute certain types of cases. However, some argue that such reversals of the burden of proof weaken the principle of innocent until proven guilty. Civil Liberties Australia opposes such laws, saying they are dangerous. There is the potential for the reversal of the burden of proof to lead to people who are innocent being found guilty. This is especially true for those who are most disadvantaged and unlikely to be able to either a\ufb00  ord or access legal advice.\nIn 2014 the Federal Government asked the \nAustralian Law Reform Commission to look at Commonwealth laws dealing with onus of proof. The Commission found that some burden of proof laws, including deeming provisions for serious drug/uni00A0o\ufb00  ences, \nmay warrant further review. Any such review \nshould consider whether placing an evidential rather than legal burden on the defendant would be su\ufb03   cient to balance the presumption of innocence with the legitimate objectives pursued by these laws.\nActivity 2.1  Folio exercise\nThe burden of proof\n1 Identify the party who usually bears the burden of proof in a criminal trial.\n2 Explain why some might argue that it is appropriate to reverse the burden of proof for drug \npossession/uni00A0charges.\n3 \u2018Reversing the burden of proof in a criminal trial will always lead to an injustice for the accused.\u2019 To what extent do you agree?

  "Page 40": "Standard of proof\nIn criminal law , the standard of proof is the level of proof that must be satisfi  ed in order \nto fi  nd the accused guilty . The standard of proof that must be met in a criminal case is \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019. In common law , a judge should not expand on the meaning of\u00a0\u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019. The Juries Direction Act 2015 provides that a judge may give\u00a0a jury directions clarifying the meaning of \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 if the jury asks\u00a0the trial judge:\n\u2022 a direct question about the meaning of the phrase\n\u2022 a question that indirectly raises the meaning of the phrase.\nHowever, determining what this means, and how the standard applies to a case, is up \nto\u00a0each individual juror.\nThe presumption of innocence\nThe presumption of innocence means that a person charged with a criminal offence \nhas the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to the law . The presumption of innocence emerged through the common law . In Woolmington v DPP [1935] AC 1, the UK House of Lords established that \u2018[t]hroughout the web of the English criminal law one golden thread is always to be seen \u2013 that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the prisoner\u2019s guilt\u2019. More recently , in Australia, French CJ of the High Court stated, in Momcilovic v The Queen (2011) 245 CLR 1, that the \u2018\u201cpresumption of innocence\u201d in criminal proceedings is an important incident of the liberty of the subject\u2019.In a criminal matter, \nthe standard of proof is \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019.\nA person has the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.\nWOOLMINGTON  V DPP\nReginald Woolmington was a 21-year-old farm \nlabourer from Castleton near Sherbourne, England. In August 1934, he married 17-year-old Violet Kathleen. In\u00a0October Violet Kathleen gave birth to a son. Three months after their marriage, Violet left Reginald and returned to live with her mother.\nOn 10 December 1934, Reginald stole a shotgun \nand cartridges. He went to his mother-in-law\u2019s home and confronted Violet. He claimed that he wanted to frighten his wife into returning to him by threatening to shoot himself. During the confrontation, the gun discharged and Violet was shot through the heart. Reginald was charged with murder. He claimed that the death was an accident.\nThe fi  rst trial lasted one day and the jury could \nnot agree on a verdict. At the second trial the judge directed the jury that all homicide is presumed to be malicious and murder and that the defendant must prove that it was an accident. In\u00a0an hour, the jury returned a guilty verdict.\nThe case went on appeal to the House of \nLords and\u00a0the conviction was quashed. Reginald Woolmington was released three days before he was\u00a0due to be executed.\nThis presumption of innocence is established through the common law . Australia is also a \nparty to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which protects \nthe presumption of innocence in Article 14(2).\nIn Victoria, the presumption of innocence is also stated in the Charter of Human Rights \nand Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic) section 25(1).\nPRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE\nICCPR \u2013 Article 14(2)\nEveryone charged with a criminal offence shall have the right to be presumed \ninnocent until proven guilty according to law .\nCharter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006/uni00A0(Vic)\nSection 25 Rights in criminal proceedings\n1 A person charged with a criminal offence has the right to be presumed innocent \nuntil proven guilty according to law .The presumption of \ninnocence is included in the ICCPR and the Victorian Charter of Human Rights and responsiblilities. 32 Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 41": "2.3  The rights of an accused\nThe accused is the person against whom a criminal case is brought. An accused person \nhas not yet been found guilty of a crime and he or she is entitled to the presumption of \ninnocence. The accused person also has a number of other rights.\nThe right to be tried without \nunreasonable delay\nThe Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic) requires a person who is \narrested or detained on a criminal charge to be promptly brought before a court (section \n21(5)(a)) and be brought to trial without unreasonable delay (sections 21(5)(b) and 25(2)(c)).\nJustice Kellam considered this right in the context of a bail application in Mokbel v \nDPP (No. 3) [2002] VSC 393, stating that \u2018the community will not tolerate the indefi  nite detention of persons awaiting trial\u2019. In this case, the accused man, Antonius (\u2018Tony\u2019) Mokbel, was held in custody awaiting trial for serious drug-related charges. Due to concerns surrounding the delays in committal proceedings and trial, bail was granted. Subsequently , Mokbel breached his bail conditions and \ufb02  ed to Greece. He\u00a0was discovered and extradited back to Australia 15\u00a0months later.\nThe Criminal Procedure Act 2009 (Vic) creates time limits for \nthe start of trials. If an accused is charged with a sexual offence, the trial must commence within three months of the day on which the person is committed for trial. If an accused is charged with an offence other than a sexual offence, the trial must start within 12 months of the day on which the person is committed for trial. These time requirements underline the importance of the concept of bail, and therefore of bail rules and procedures.\nFigure 2.4 Tony Mokbel\nThe right to a fair and unbiased hearing\nPre-trial procedures\nCriminal pre-trial procedures aim to provide individuals with a fair and unbiased hearing. Police investigations must be carried out in a fair manner. The police are required to caution suspects before questioning so that suspects are aware of their rights. Individuals being questioned have the right to remain silent or say \u2018no comment\u2019, but an individual is required to give his or her name and address. This recognises that all individuals have the\u00a0right to be considered innocent until proven guilty . It also protects individuals against self-incrimination.\nThe process of bail further protects the rights of individuals to be treated fairly . Bail \nallows a person to be released into the community while he or she awaits trial or the next hearing, on the undertaking that they will appear in court on the date set. Bail is part of recognising that all people are considered innocent until proven guilty: a person who is accused of a crime but has not yet been convicted, is, in most cases, entitled to his or her\u00a0liberty .\nBail is decided by the court on a case-by-case basis. The court will hear evidence \nfrom the accused who seeks bail, or their legal representative, and may hear evidence from those opposing bail (often the police). In many cases a person will be released on bail on their own undertaking to appear in court. Sometimes the court may impose conditions. Common conditions are:\n\u2022 not contacting the victim/s or other witnesses\n\u2022 having counselling or medical treatment\u2022 living at a particular address\u2022 regularly reporting to a police station.A person accused of a \ncrime has certain rights.\nA person accused of and charged with a crime must be brought to trial promptly and without unreasonable delay.\nAn accused must be cautioned by police and he or she has the right to remain silent.

  "Page 44": "The right to a trial by jury\nIt is widely accepted that the right to trial by jury is important in a democratic society . \nThis\u00a0is because:\n\u2022 randomly selected jurors are likely , as a group, to represent community views and \nvalues in their verdict\n\u2022 the jury system gives an opportunity for the community to participate in the \njustice\u00a0system\n\u2022 the jury can protect against any government corruption by acting as a \u2018buffer\u2019 \u2013 an \nindependent fact-fi  nding body that is not subject to government in\ufb02  uence.\nRight to trial by jury \u2013 Commonwealth\nSection 80 of the Commonwealth Constitution gives a person accused of a Commonwealth indictable offence the right to a trial by jury . It states: \u2018The trial on\u00a0indictment of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth shall be by jury . \u2019 The\u00a0section was\u00a0based on a provision contained in the US Constitution \u2013 people charged with serious offences are entitled to have their guilt or innocence determined by the judgment of their peers. The\u00a0Commonwealth Constitution does not give a right to a trial by jury for summary\u00a0offences.\nSection 4G of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) states that Commonwealth offences that \nare punishable by imprisonment for 12 months or more are indictable offences. Commonwealth offences which are likely to be classifi  ed as indictable offences include treason, child sex tourism and piracy .\nDecisions of the High Court of Australia have interpreted section 80 of the \nCommonwealth Constitution as allowing the Commonwealth parliament to decide whether an offence is an indictable offence or a summary offence. So as the Commonwealth parliament has control over how a Commonwealth offence is classifi  ed, it\u00a0also has control over whether or not an accused has a right to a trial by jury .\nRight to trial by jury \u2013 Victoria\nIn Victoria, all indictable offences tried in the County Court and Supreme Court (Trial Division) are heard before a jury of 12 randomly selected citizens.\nIn New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and the ACT, it \nis possible to apply to have a trial heard by a judge alone, without a jury , when charged with an indictable offence under State legislation. Such an application might be made if an accused and his or her legal representative are concerned about pre-trial publicity hindering a fair hearing or if the jury does not approach the case impartially .\nThe Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities emphasises the \nimportance of impartiality by stating that a person charged with a criminal offence has the right to have the charge or proceeding decided by a competent, independent and impartial court or tribunal after a fair and public hearing (section 24(1)). In a jury trial, impartiality is achieved by empanelling jury members who do not come to the trial with preconceptions about the case, or personal biases.Trial by jury is a feature of \na democratic society.\nSection 80 of the Commonwealth Constitution establishes the right to trial by jury for a Commonwealth indictable offence.\nIn Victoria, indictable offences are heard before a judge or magistrate and a jury of 12 citizens.\nJurors must be impartial and reach a verdict based upon the evidence presented at trial.\nActivity 2.2  Structured questions\nThe impact of social media on court proceedings\n1 Read NewsReport 2.2 on page 34 and explain why Victoria Police might have warned Facebook users \nthat/uni00A0it is inappropriate to speculate upon a matter before the courts.\n2 In your opinion, should a juror who misuses social media during a trial be given a sanction?

Hamdi \nAlqudsi, a disability pensioner from Sydney\u2019s southwest, was charged with seven offences against the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 (Cth). The Act makes it an offence for a person to give money, goods or services to a person or body for the purpose of supporting or promoting the commission of an incursion into a foreign country to engage in hostilities. Alqudsi made a motion to the High Court to be tried by a judge only. However, the High Court dismissed the motion. In its published reasons for the decision, the \u2018Court held that provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), which provided for trial by a judge without a jury, were not capable of being applied to the applicant\u2019s trial because their application would be inconsistent with section 80 of the Constitution\u2019.\nThe court, in its majority decision (Chief Justice Robert French dissented), upheld the \nview that section 80 cannot be interpreted to allow judge-only trials in any circumstances: \u2018a trial on indictment for an offence against a law of the Commonwealth does \u2026 have to be before a jury\u2019.\nFollowing the High Court decision, Alqudsi was found guilty in the NSW Supreme \nCourt.

These arrangements are designed to make the giving of evidence less intimidating.\nThe court may allow a vulnerable witness to give evidence from a place other than \nthe courtroom by using CCTV . This is often used for a witness (and/or victim) of a sexual offence so that he or she does not have to see the accused in person. If the witness attends the courtroom to give evidence, screens can be used to block the witness\u2019 view of the accused. The court can also allow the witness to have a person approved by the court beside them to provide emotional support while they give evidence. The court can also:\n\u2022 specify that only particular people can be in the courtroom while the witness \ngives\u00a0evidence\n\u2022 require legal practitioners not to wear robes\n\u2022 require legal practitioners to be seated when examining or cross-examining the \nwitness.\nIn addition to these rights, child victims and victims with a cognitive impairment may also \nbe able to give their evidence at a special hearing. The special hearing is an audiovisual recording of all the evidence, including cross-examination and re-examination of the witness. This recording is then played to the jury at the trial. The purpose of a special hearing is to limit the number of times that a vulnerable witness gives evidence.\nThe right to be informed about \nthe\u00a0proceedings\nSection 8 of the Victims\u2019 Charter requires an investigating agency to inform a victim, at \nreasonable intervals, about the progress of an investigation into a criminal offence unless the victim requests not to be given information, or if disclosure may harm the investigation.\nA victim is to be provided with the following information from the prosecution:\n\u2022 the charges against the person accused of the criminal offence\u2022 if there are no charges against any person, the reason for this\u2022 any decisions to substantially modify charges, not proceed with some or all of the \ncharges, or to accept a plea of guilty to a lesser charge\n\u2022 how to fi  nd out the date, time and place of the hearing, or the charges against the \naccused person\n\u2022 the outcome of the criminal proceeding against the accused person, including any \nsentence imposed\n\u2022 details of an appeal if one is initiated.\nA victim must also be informed of the court processes and his or her right to attend \nrelevant court proceedings.

Despite the best aims of the criminal justice system, factors such as costs, time, and cultural differences can\u00a0mean that not all parties feel that they have been treated in a just manner.\nCost\nThe fi  nancial cost of accessing the criminal justice system impacts upon our ability to \nachieve justice. The costs of court fees and legal representation can be prohibitive for many , meaning that access to justice is limited or denied in many cases. These costs rise for indictable offences heard in higher courts, due to the length and complexity of trials.\nThe costs of an appeal, if there are grounds of appeal, are an additional expense in \nachieving justice. VLA is a service that attempts to address this factor, but there are limits on who can qualify for Legal Aid assistance.The victims\u2019 register \nprovides victims with certain information about the offender, including the offender\u2019s parole status and their earliest release/uni00A0date.\nCourt fees and legal representation are too expensive for many/uni00A0people.\nVictoria Legal Aid \n(VLA) can provide legal assistance to those who/uni00A0qualify.

  "Page 50": "Time\nDelays and the backlog of cases also impact upon the criminal justice system\u2019s ability to \nachieve justice for both the accused and the victims of crime.\nCriminal pre-trial procedures, particularly committal proceedings, aim to provide \na timely resolution of criminal disputes. Committal proceedings, used for indictable offences, aim to ensure that a prima facie case is established before proceeding to trial. This means that a magistrate is satisfi  ed that there is suffi  cient evidence to support a conviction at trial by a jury . This process is designed to fi  lter out weaker cases, and to resolve more minor issues and administrative matters before the trial. However, some argue that committal hearings in fact add to the length of the matter, particularly for cases that are strong. For more information about committal proceedings, see Chapter 3.\nAdditionally , the current overcrowding in Victoria\u2019s prisons has been reported to \nbe causing delays in matters being heard. Corrections Victoria is responsible for the transportation of prisoners to court hearings. The increase in prisoner numbers, particularly remand prisoners, has placed increased demand on these services. As a consequence, some prisoners have not been transported to courts in a timely fashion and\u00a0have missed hearings. These delays in transporting prisoners to court hearings result\u00a0in cases being delayed, which reduces the criminal justice system\u2019s ability to achieve justice for the accused and victims \u2013 justice delayed is justice denied.\nCultural differences\nSome groups in the community have particular diffi  culty accessing the criminal justice system. Cultural differences can be a factor affecting the ability of the criminal justice system to achieve justice for an accused, and for victims of crime.\nIndigenous Australians\nIndigenous Australians are one group who may experience disadvantage in the criminal justice system. This is due to the discrimination and prejudice that has been experienced by many members of the Indigenous community , including in their dealings with the criminal justice system. These diffi  culties have been addressed, to some degree, through initiatives such as the Koori Court and the Aboriginal Community Liaison Offi  cer (ACLO) Program offered by Victoria Police. The impact of cultural differences on the ability of the criminal justice system to achieve justice for Indigenous Australians is discussed in more detail in Chapter 3.\nNon-English speakers\nCultural and linguistic differences can reduce the ability of the criminal justice system to achieve justice for an offender and/or victims. Some migrants who speak a language other than English, and English speakers with a low profi  ciency in the English language, may fi  nd it diffi  cult to access legal services, understand their rights or give evidence in court. To address this, to at least some degree, the Magistrates\u2019 Court provides interpreters, free of charge, for an accused in a criminal matter.\n2.6  Recent reforms\nIn order to ensure that the criminal justice system achieves the principles of justice, and addresses current issues and demands, reforms need to be made from time to time. Changes made to improve the criminal justice system may come from members of the community , the media, police, the courts, parliament and other stakeholders in the criminal justice system.

  "Page 51": "Increasing access\nOne recent reform that has impacted on the ability of the criminal justice system to achieve \njustice is the change to VLA\u2019s means testing. This recent reform affords more people the right to a fair and unbiased\u00a0hearing.\nIn order to qualify for VLA assistance, an applicant must be means-tested. This means \nthat the person applying for legal assistance has his or her income and the value of their assets assessed. This is to ensure that funding goes to those in the greatest fi  nancial need (along with other considerations).\nAs of 1 March 2016, VLA raised the amounts for the criterion of fi  nancial eligibility for \nlegal assistance. For example, the amount that has been set as the maximum net income (what a person has left over from their pay after paying their expenses for the week) is $360 per week. Before the change, the amount was $255 per week. This reform, along with the other criteria, means that more people will qualify for legal assistance. Without this reform, those who did not qualify may have put themselves into signifi  cant debt or gone without legal advice.\nIt is reported that this reform will help an extra 700 people annually and cost $5 million \nover 5 years.\n2.7  Recommended reforms\nRecommended reforms to the criminal justice system differ from recent reforms, as recommended reforms have not yet resulted in change. These calls for change can, like recent reforms, originate from a range of different stakeholders in the criminal justice\u00a0system.\nAvoiding unreasonable delays\nDue to an increase in the number of people being held on remand, signifi  cant delays in the transport of prisoners was reported in early 2016. This resulted in a backlog of cases, particularly in the Magistrates\u2019 Court. The backlog created unreasonable delays for those charged with criminal offences and being held in remand. To address this backlog, some magistrates released lower-risk offenders on bail, hoping that this would make it more likely that those people would be able to turn up to their court appearances on time. One recommended reform to address this problem was to use video links between the courts and prisons.\nNEWSREPORT  2.3\nGet me to court on time?\nA MEMBER OF A MOTORCYCLE GANG DID NOT APPEAR IN THE  \nMagistrates\u2019/uni00A0Court because Corrections Victoria failed to take him there \nfrom Port Phillip Prison.

The judge agreed, saying that/uni00A0the man should be taken to court when he was ordered to appear there./uni00A0The defendant appeared in court/uni00A0that afternoon.\nIn June 2016, it was reported that Corrections Victoria had been /f_i  ned in more \nthan 650 cases where prisoners missed criminal proceedings. In the same year the Justice Legislation (Evidence and Other Acts) Amendment Act 2016 (Vic) was passed. This Act allows for Magistrates\u2019 Court hearings involving remand prisoners to be conducted via video link.More people qualify for \nlegal assistance now that VLA have lifted their thresholds.\nRecommended reforms are suggestions to improve the criminal justice system that have not yet been adopted.Chapter 2 Criminal law and justice 43\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

Important court dates included committal hearings, trials and retrials, sentencing hearings in the Supreme Court and County Court and appeals to the Court of Appeal.\nIn 2016, the State government announced that it \nwould provide $330,000 for specialist family violence responses for CALD victims and perpetrators in the corrections system.\nRoyal Commission into Family Violence\nFollowing the report of the Royal Commission into Family Violence, the Commonwealth government announced immediate measures to improve support and services for women. This included $15 million to establish specialised domestic violence units to provide access to coordinated legal, social work and cultural liaison services for women in a single location, and allowing legal services to work with local hospitals, including for women from CALD communities.\nJudicial Council on Cultural Diversity\nThe Judicial Council on Cultural Diversity is composed of members of the judiciary, with select representation from legal and community bodies.

Legal brief 2.2\nDoes cultural diversity impact on justice?\nThere are more than 275 cultural and ethnic groups recognised in Australia. Each of these groups has its own unique history \u2013 linguistic, ethnic, cultural and religious. People who are culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) may be disadvantaged in their dealings with the Australian legal system. Studies indicate that fear of crime is disproportionately experienced by CALD communities, and that these fears are linked to hate/uni00A0crimes.\nCALD women may arrive in Australia as refugees, \nimmigrants, international students or as unaccompanied minors. Refugee and immigrant women may come from countries where the laws or culture do not recognise the rights of women in relation to domestic violence or sexual offences in the same way as Australian law. In some cultures women who have been the victims of these offences may experience signi/f_i  cant shame and/uni00A0guilt.\nMigrant and refugee women and the \njustice\u00a0system\nCALD women, particularly those who are newly arrived, \nface additional barriers within the justice system. These barriers operate on two levels. First, they face barriers in being able to access the justice system: they just don\u2019t know how to go about getting help. Second, they face barriers going through the legal processes and accessing the support services available to victims of crime: again, they may not know that there are services available, and even if they do, they may not be able to use them or be willing to use them.\nThe consequences of these barriers are that CALD \nwomen are:\n\u00b7less likely to report violence\n\u00b7less likely to take a complaint to the legal system\n\u00b7intimidated by the legal processes and procedures\n\u00b7more likely to disengage with the support services\noffered.\nThere is also a tendency for CALD women to under-report crimes committed against them. This may be due to a lack of knowledge of their rights, a lack of knowledge about how to access legal assistance, a negative perception of the role of authority /f_i  gures in the legal system or not understanding that certain types of behaviour, such as family violence, are  criminal offences. These dif/f_i  culties are further complicated by a lack of understanding of English, reliance on the provision of appropriate interpreters, and a lack of familiarity with court processes and procedures.\nDif/f_i  culties experienced either in their country of origin \nor as a refugee can also have a negative impact. These women may have come from countries with limited legal, /f_i  nancial or social support systems. Unaware of the support services that might assist them, they can experience signi/f_i  cant isolation within our community. This leaves many women highly vulnerable to abuse by partners, and less likely to report domestic violence or to recognise domestic violence as a criminal offence.\nDif\ufb01  culties accessing the justice system\nStudies have indicated a reluctance by CALD women to report cases of domestic violence. They may not necessarily recognise that family violence includes stalking, threatening violence, physical assault and economic abuse, and that these actions are considered criminal offences in Australia. Additionally, some cultures do not see some forms of violence within marriage as a crime. It has also been suggested that a lack of knowledge about legal rights and the overall operation of the legal system make women less likely to access legal services. For instance, some CALD women are reluctant to report a crime because they fear that doing so may mean they need to leave the family home. However, the Family Violence Protection Act 2008 (Vic) allows victims of domestic violence to remain in the home. A fear of homelessness may lead CALD women to be reluctant to report a crime.\nA study funded by inTouch \u2013 Multicultural Centre \nAgainst Family Violence and by the Victorian Law Foundation, \u2018I lived in fear because I know nothing\u2019, \nnoted:\nWomen\u2019s lack of knowledge about their rights \nand the way the system works was compounded by illiteracy, low socio-economic status and a lack of accessible information, especially in their own language.\nThis lack of information makes women vulnerable to \nanxiety about how legal authorities will respond. Many of these women experience signi/f_i  cant social isolation: they avoid con/f_i  ding in their families because they fear ostracism by their families.\nAn additional dif/f_i  culty for some CALD women may be \nseeing themselves as dependent on their husbands \u2013 they have to stay with their husband in order to maintain their residency in Australia. Women on dependent spouse visas may be reluctant to report domestic violence for fear of losing their visa status. Changes in visa status can have serious consequences in terms of access to public housing and income support. These women may fear that reporting offences will result in being deported.\nSometimes reluctance to engage with the legal system \nmay be a consequence of experiences with the law in another country. Women from a CALD background may have negative perceptions of police based on past experiences in their country of origin.\nBarriers to going through the justice system\nCommunication is a major barrier for CALD women going through the legal system.

That report recommended that the Victims\u2019 Charter Act 2006 (Vic) be amended to require prosecuting agencies to offer conferences before and after important court dates for speci/f_i  c groups, including victims whose /f_i  rst language is not English. Important court dates included committal hearings, trials and retrials, sentencing hearings in the Supreme Court and County Court and appeals to the Court of Appeal.\nIn 2016, the State government announced that it \nwould provide $330,000 for specialist family violence responses for CALD victims and perpetrators in the corrections system.\nRoyal Commission into Family Violence\nFollowing the report of the Royal Commission into Family Violence, the Commonwealth government announced immediate measures to improve support and services for women. This included $15 million to establish specialised domestic violence units to provide access to coordinated legal, social work and cultural liaison services for women in a single location, and allowing legal services to work with local hospitals, including for women from CALD communities.\nJudicial Council on Cultural Diversity\nThe Judicial Council on Cultural Diversity is composed of members of the judiciary, with select representation from legal and community bodies. In 2016, the Council released its consultation report \u2013 \u2018The Path to Justice: Migrant and Refugee Women\u2019. Recommendations in the report included:\n\u00b7The provision of joint community education forums\nfor migrant and refugee communities.\n\u00b7Magistrates\u2019 Courts should provide educationsessions for women applying for intervention orders.\n\u00b7All courts should introduce Court Cultural LiaisonOf/f_i  cers.\n\u00b7Courts should invest in comprehensive culturaltraining for all court staff.\n\u00b7Courts should improve signage and informationavailable upon arrival at court.\n\u00b7All courts should have court interpreter policies thatare publicly available and easily accessible, including:\n /uni2010 who is responsible for arranging and paying for\nan/uni00A0interpreter;\n /uni2010 procedures to identify when an interpreter is \nneeded; and\n /uni2010 procedures for ensuring that appropriate \ninterpreters are used.\nVictoria Legal Aid\nVLA produces legal resources in a range of community \nlanguages. In 2017 VLA released an education kit: \u2018Australian law in orientation\u2019. The kit is designed to help educators, teachers and community workers teach people who have been in Australia for less than 6 months, and/or who have little or no English, and/or very basic legal/uni00A0literacy.  Legal brief 2.2\nDoes cultural diversity impact on justice?\nThere are more than 275 cultural and ethnic groups recognised in Australia. Each of these groups has its own unique history \u2013 linguistic, ethnic, cultural and religious. People who are culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) may be disadvantaged in their dealings with the Australian legal system. Studies indicate that fear of crime is disproportionately experienced by CALD communities, and that these fears are linked to hate/uni00A0crimes.\nCALD women may arrive in Australia as refugees, \nimmigrants, international students or as unaccompanied minors. Refugee and immigrant women may come from countries where the laws or culture do not recognise the rights of women in relation to domestic violence or sexual offences in the same way as Australian law. In some cultures women who have been the victims of these offences may experience signi/f_i  cant shame and/uni00A0guilt.\nMigrant and refugee women and the \njustice\u00a0system\nCALD women, particularly those who are newly arrived, \nface additional barriers within the justice system.

  "Page 55": "Key point summary\nDo your notes cover all the following points?\n /uni274FThe principles of justice and how they relate to criminal law\n - Fairness \u2013 In the Victorian criminal justice system, natural justice (or procedural fairness) needs to be \nupheld. This includes the rule against bias and the right to a fair hearing.\n - Equality \u2013 The criminal justice system seeks to achieve equality by treating the accused and victims of \ncrime uniformly. It is recognised that certain participants in the criminal justice system need to be assisted \nwith specialised procedures and facilities.\n - Access \u2013 Affording the cost of the criminal justice can be diffi  cult for many, and it affects their ability to \naccess the system. VLA aims to overcome this barrier, for those who qualify for assistance. Access to information is also important for those accessing the criminal justice system.\n /uni274FKey concepts of the criminal justice system\n - The distinction between summary and indictable offences\n \u00b7A crime is an act or omission committed against the community at large that is punishable by law. Criminal offences are summary offences, indictable offences, or indictable offences tried summarily.\n \u00b7The purposes of criminal law include punishing the offender and protecting the community.\n \u00b7There are numerous procedures that need to be followed in a criminal law matter. There are pre-trial procedures, trial procedures, and post-trial procedures.\n - The burden and standard of proof in a criminal trial. The burden of proof is usually held by the prosecution \nin a criminal trial, but in some circumstances the burden can be reversed onto the plaintiff. The standard of proof in a criminal trial is \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019.\n - The presumption of innocence. A person charged with a criminal offence has the right to be presumed \ninnocent until proven guilty according to law.\n /uni274FRights of the accused\n - The right to be tried without unreasonable delay.\n - The right to a fair and unbiased hearing in pre-trial hearings and at trial. - The rights of the accused are protected by the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic). - There is a right to a trial by jury for Commonwealth and Victorian indictable offences.\n /uni274FRights of victims\n - The principles of the Victims\u2019 Charter Act 2006 (Vic). - Things that a victim should generally be informed of include:\n \u00b7his or her rights\n \u00b7services available\n \u00b7the progress made on the case\n \u00b7if a person has been charged with a crime\n \u00b7court dates and times\n \u00b7whether he or she will be required as a witness\n \u00b7if the accused has received bail and, if so, the steps taken to keep the victim safe\n \u00b7the operations of the court system\n \u00b7the right to be kept safe in court\n \u00b7the right to provide a Victim Impact Statement if an offender has been convicted\n \u00b7the right to seek compensation\n \u00b7the right to receive information from the victims\u2019 register about an offender sent to prison for a violent crime.

  "Page 60": "3.1  The criminal justice system\nCriminal law sets out the boundaries of acceptable behaviour of individuals in society \nfor the protection and benefi  t of the community . When a law is broken, the criminal justice system, on behalf of the state, and thus of society as a whole, uses its processes, institutions and personnel to ensure that the correct person is charged and dealt with in a manner that is effective, but also fair and equitable. The accused must have access to services to ensure that their side of events is properly heard.\nVictoria\u2019s criminal justice system is based on the presumption of innocence, meaning \nthat the accused person is presumed innocent until their accuser, the prosecution, proves them guilty \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 to a magistrate (Magistrates\u2019 Court) or a jury (County or Supreme Court). Because the rules of evidence and procedures in our court system are very strict, it is regarded as necessary for the accused to have legal representation. Having the advice of a solicitor and the representation of a barrister in court is important for both pre-trial and trial procedures.\nThere are a number of procedures can be used during the investigation of a criminal \noffence and leading up to a court hearing.\nOffence committed\nSuspect detained\nCharge Arrest\nSummonsRelease on caution\nBail remand application\nReleased until hearingDecision not to charge\nHeld in custody\nFigure 3.1 Criminal pre-trial proceduresIn most instances, offences \ncome to the attention of the police in the normal course of their duties, or are reported by the public. 52 Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

  "Page 62": "3.2  The Victorian court system\nVictorian courts are arranged in a hierarchy . Courts are ranked from inferior to superior \nbased on their jurisdictions. This provides a much more effi  cient process, as each level of court hears similar types of disputes, deals with them in a similar manner and has personnel who are specialists in the particular areas of law that they work in. This plays an\u00a0important role in reducing delays.\nEach State has its own hierarchy of courts that hear and determine matters relating to \nState law . In addition, there are federal courts that deal with matters that have a federal jurisdiction, such as the Family Court. The High Court of Australia is our highest court. It\u00a0deals with the most complex disputes, including the interpretation of the Constitution and appeals.\nFederal court\nState courts\nMagistrates\u2019 CourtCounty CourtSupreme CourtCourt of AppealHigh Court\nFigure 3.3 Court hierarchy\nThere are two main types of jurisdictions:\nOriginal jurisdiction means the areas of law that a court is able to hear and determine \na case at fi  rst instance (the fi  rst time the case is heard). If a person pleads not guilty they will be tried in the court that specialises in that type of offence; for example, the Supreme Court (Trial Division) will hear murder trials.\nAppellate jurisdiction is the power of a court to review decisions made by lower courts. \nIf a party is not satisfi  ed the correct decision has been made by a court, they can apply to have an appeal heard by a superior court. These requests will usually be granted if there are suitable grounds.\nReasons for a court hierarchy\nTwo key reasons for the Victorian court hierarchy in determining criminal cases are specialisation and to provide avenues for appeal.\nSpecialisation\nA court hierarchy enables the workload of the courts to be divided. Each court is limited \nto a specifi  c area of jurisdiction in which it has expertise. The court processes are also streamlined to provide for specialised legal personnel and legal procedures. The judge or magistrate in each court can develop a specialised understanding of the law with respect to the types of cases that are determined in that particular court.\nAppeals\nThe right to appeal is fundamental to the concept of justice and fairness. A hierarchy allows \nan individual to appeal a case to a higher court. This would not be possible without a court hierarchy . People who believe that they have grounds for an appeal have the opportunity to have their case heard again in a superior court by a judge with specialist knowledge and expertise. The judge in the superior court is able to uphold the decision of the inferior court, or reverse the decision of the inferior court \u2013 this may create a\u00a0precedent.A court hierarchy is a \nranking in order.\nOriginal jurisdiction means \nthe areas of law that a court is able to hear and determine a case at /f_i  rst instance (the /f_i  rst time the case is heard).\nAppellate jurisdiction is \nthe power of a court to review decisions made by/uni00A0lower courts.\nA court hierarchy allows each court to develop the skills, expertise and processes to deal with speci/f_i  c types of disputes.\nThe court hierarchy allows for a system of appeals to review the decisions of/uni00A0lower courts. 54 Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

  "Page 64": "Other reasons for a court hierarchy\nAdministrative convenience\nA court hierarchy makes effi  cient use of the limited fi  nancial and physical resources \navailable for criminal cases. A hierarchy is administratively convenient because it provides \na means of allocating cases quickly , thus reducing the likelihood of delays. Summary offences can be allocated to the Magistrates\u2019 Court, where they can be heard relatively quickly . More complex indictable matters generally take longer to hear. These cases are heard in higher courts by judges with the expertise to deal with such matters.\nDoctrine of precedent\nThe operation of the doctrine of judicial precedent is dependent on a hierarchy of courts. \nPrecedents are new legal principles established in the superior courts. The decision of a superior court is binding on all courts lower in the hierarchy in cases where the facts are similar. An important advantage of the doctrine of precedent is that it provides for consistency in laws.\nTime and money\nDetermining a criminal case can be a costly and time-consuming process. A court hierarchy enables summary offences to be dealt with relatively quickly and inexpensively in the Magistrates\u2019 Court rather than having them determined in the County Court or Supreme Court. A visit to the local Magistrates\u2019 Court will illustrate how quickly some cases can be resolved: on any given day , it may hear many more cases than the County Court or Supreme Court could hear in days, weeks, or even months.\nExpertise and experience\nA court hierarchy enables more serious, diffi  cult, technical or complex cases to be \nheard by experienced and specially qualifi  ed judges. Cases concerning murder are heard in the Supreme Court (Trial Division). Supreme Court judges have many years of experience as lawyers before their appointment. The parties to cases benefi  t from having highly qualifi  ed judges appointed to their case. Appeal cases can be particularly complex. These cases demand an experienced and well-qualifi  ed judge.A court hierarchy provides \nfor the most ef/f_i  cient use of court resources and avoids delays.\nA court hierarchy is necessary for the doctrine of precedent to operate.\nA court hierarchy allows minor cases to be heard relatively quickly and in a less costly manner.\nA court hierarchy allows cases to be allocated to courts with the appropriate expertise and/uni00A0experience. 56 Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

  "Page 67": "WHY HAVE YOUR CASE HEARD \nIN THE MAGISTRATES\u2019 COURT ?\nThe advantages of having a matter prosecuted in the Magistrates\u2019 Court include:\n \u00b7The matter will be dealt with relatively quickly and inexpensively , as \ncompared with being tried in the County Court. This is particularly important if the defendant is remanded in custody until the matter is dealt with by the\u00a0court.\n \u00b7If the defendant is found guilty by the court, the maximum penalty that can be issued by a Magistrates\u2019 Court is less than the maximum penalty that a judge of the County Court can hand down. A magistrate can sentence up to 2 years per conviction with a total sentence of 5 years.\n \u00b7The Magistrates\u2019 Court is less formal than the County Court. While representation by a lawyer is advisable, it is not absolutely necessary .\n \u00b7Time delays are generally less when going to the Magistrates\u2019 Court than when going to the County Court. This can save costs. Costs can also be saved if your solicitor can also appear for you in the Magistrates\u2019 Court; in the\u00a0Country Court you generally need a barrister as well as your solicitor.\nCommittal proceedings\nMore serious indictable offences are prosecuted in the County Court or the Supreme \nCourt, depending on the nature and seriousness of the crime. However, before such a case is brought to trial, a hearing (called a committal hearing) is conducted in the Magistrates\u2019 Court. The hearing is to establish whether there is evidence of suffi  cient weight to support a conviction by a properly instructed jury in the County Court or the Supreme\u00a0Court.\nIf there is not suffi  cient evidence against the defendant to justify the case being sent \nto\u00a0trial in a higher court, the case is dismissed and the defendant is released.\nIf a magistrate believes there is suffi  cient evidence to support a conviction, the matter \nis sent for trial in a higher court. The accused will be remanded in custody or granted bail\u00a0until the trial.\nFor further details on committal hearings, see page 77.\nOther matters heard in the \nMagistrates\u2019\u00a0Court\nBail applications\nWhen a suspect has been taken into custody and charged by the police, he or she \ncan apply for bail. The Magistrates\u2019 Court can hear the suspect\u2019s application for bail. \nApplications for bail can be made at various stages in criminal cases, and bail can also be granted at a police station, or by a bail justice. In most instances, a bail justice will decide bail. Judges in the County Court or Supreme Court also can hear bail applications. Following the tragic events in Bourke Street Mall in January 2017 (the alleged offender was out on bail), the system of bail justices was reviewed. If an application for bail is not successful, the suspect will be held in remand.\nWarrants\nA warrant is a legal document used by the court to authorise a particular act. For instance, \nan arrest warrant allows a police offi  cer to arrest and detain a suspect. All warrants, other than a search warrant, may be issued by a registrar or a magistrate. A search warrant can only be issued by a magistrate.The Magistrates\u2019 \nCourt hears committal proceedings to determine if there is evidence of suf/f_i  cient weight to support a conviction in/uni00A0a/uni00A0higher/uni00A0court.\nThe Magistrates\u2019 Court will hear bail applications.\nThe Magistrates\u2019 Court can issue warrants.

  "Page 69": "  Legal brief 3.1\nWhat is a \u2018problem-solving\u2019 court?\nThe Magistrates\u2019 Court is known as a \u2018problem-solving court\u2019 as it has a range of \nspecialist courts and court support services. The initiatives used in these specialist courts and support services aim to help all those who come in contact with the court system, including the/uni00A0accused.\nIt is clear that some offences can be caused by people who are experiencing social \nor cultural disadvantage \u2013 disability, substance abuse, cognitive impairment or mental illness, for example. These issues can lead to offending or other anti-social behaviour. By addressing the underlying issues, the court is seeking a longer-term /f_i  x which is more effective than applying sanctions.\nThere are several reasons why our courts are looking towards a more problem-solving \napproach. They include:\n \u00b7increasing frustration on the part of the courts and the public with traditional approaches to case processing\n \u00b7increasing court workloads\n \u00b7a growing prison population\n \u00b7a breakdown in the social and community institutions that have supported individuals in the past\n \u00b7the dif/f_i  culties faced by courts and correctional authorities in providing offenders with adequate or effective services\n \u00b7the realisation that reoffending (recidivism) \u2013 caused by underlying physical, psychological, social or economic circumstance \u2013 is probably more effectively and economically dealt with by social intervention than by harsh sentences.\nIn dealing with criminal matters, the Magistrates\u2019 Court includes, amongst others, the following specialist divisions.\nDrug Court\nThe creation of this specialist court was in response to the failure of traditional criminal justice measures to deal with drug and alcohol offending. It also aimed to improve the safety of the community by focusing on the rehabilitation of offenders and to provide assistance in reintegrating them into society.\nThe Drug Court (DCV), which sits at the Dandenong Magistrates\u2019 Court and the \nMelbourne Magistrates\u2019 Court, is concerned with the sentencing and supervision of the treatment of offenders:\n \u00b7with drug and/or alcohol dependency\n \u00b7who have committed an offence under the in/f_l  uence of drugs or alcohol\n \u00b7who have committed an offence to support a drug or alcohol habit.\nThe DCV is not available to anyone who has in/f_l  icted actual bodily harm or committed any sexual offences. It is a sentencing court, so offenders must plead guilty to the drug-related crimes. The aim of the DCV is to:\n \u00b7rehabilitate the offender\n \u00b7reduce the level of criminal activity\n \u00b7reduce the health risks associated with the offender\u2019s dependency.\nA drug treatment order can include both treatment with supervision and a custodial sentence, although the sentence can be suspended to allow treatment. If the offender receives a treatment and supervision order, there can be speci/f_i  c conditions attached to it that relate to the particular circumstances of the individual and/or case. Other conditions will also be applied. They generally include:\n \u00b7submitting to drug and/or alcohol testing, detoxi/f_i  cation or other treatment\n \u00b7attending the Drug Court when required\n \u00b7not committing another offence that is punishable by a prison sentence\n \u00b7undergoing drug and/or alcohol treatment Chapter 3 Determining a criminal case 61\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

It con/f_i  rmed the success of the DCV. The following is a sample of its /f_i  ndings:\n\u00b731% reduction in the rate of reoffending within the /f_i  rst 12 months\n\u00b734% reduction in the rate of reoffending within 24 months\n\u00b767% reduction in the more serious classi/f_i  ed offences\n\u00b790% reduction in the number of drug traf/f_i  cking offences\n\u00b754% decrease in assaults with a weapon\n\u00b770% reduction in burglary and deception offences.\nCosts of the Court and program were found to be comparable to other similar services. \nThe DCV was found to be cost-effective compared with putting offenders through the traditional court system, where many would be imprisoned.\nThe conclusion was that the DCV continues to deliver positive outcomes for the \ncommunity and participants. In 2016 the government announced the expansion of the Drug Court to Footscray, Northcote, St Kilda, Brunswick and Coburg.\nKoori Court\nThe Koori Court is part of the Victorian government\u2019s plans to reduce the overrepresentation of Aboriginal people in the justice system, both as offenders and victims. Koori Court divisions operate in the Magistrates\u2019 Court, County Court and the Children\u2019s Court. In 2016 a County Koori Court was opened in Mildura.\nThe Koori Court allows the participation of the Indigenous community in the court \nprocess. The magistrate is still in charge of the proceedings and will make the /f_i  nal decision on sentencing, but Elders and Respected Persons, a Koori Court of/f_i  cer, the defendant and their family can all contribute during the court hearing. The victim can also be present. It operates in a less formal setting, usually at a round or oval table that has the accused and their family and lawyers sitting alongside the magistrate, Elders or Respected Persons, and other relevant people. Participants speak in \u2018plain English\u2019 rather than legal jargon. Issues relating to the offence and sentence are discussed as a group. To appear before a Koori Court, the offender must identify as an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander and must have pleaded guilty to the charges, because it is a sentencing court. The court does not hear sexual offences.\nThe Koori Court was established so that the Indigenous community might better \nengage with the justice system. It aims to help offenders address the causes of their offending and so to prevent them reoffending.\nFamily Violence Court\nThe Family Violence Court deals with both the offender and victim. It aims to:\n\u00b7make access to the court easier\n\u00b7promote the safety of people affected by violence\n\u00b7increase the accountability of people who have used violence against family members\nand encourage them to change their behaviour\n\u00b7improve the protection of children exposed to family violence\n\u00b7make the process of applying for an intervention order easier, by having supportservices available to improve victims\u2019 safety and providing assistance to overcome thetrauma of family violence.\nThe magistrate can also hear related criminal justice matters, including bail applications and pleas, at the same time as hearing intervention order cases.\nThe Criminal Justice Diversion Program\nThis program provides mainly /f_i  rst-time offenders with the opportunity to avoid a criminal record by complying with various conditions that bene/f_i  t the offender, the victim and the community as a whole.\nThe bene/f_i  ts of the program include:\n\u00b7appropriate restitution being made to the victim, including letters of apology\n\u00b7preventing reoffending with assistance from counselling and/or treatment\n\u00b7avoiding a criminal record and assisting in the offender\u2019s rehabilitation\n\u00b7helping local community and charity projects with voluntary work and donations.\nTo be eligible:\n\u00b7the offence must be tried summarily\n\u00b7the offence must not be subject to a minimum or /f_i  xed sentence/penalty\n(except/uni00A0demerit points)\n\u00b7the accused must take responsibility for the offence\n\u00b7the prosecution must consent for the matter to proceed by way of Diversion.\nJustice Centres \u2013 Neighbourhood Justice Centre\nThe Neighbourhood Justice Centre (NJC) is a multijurisdictional court for the City of Yarra. It has, in its criminal jurisdiction, a Magistrates\u2019 Court, a Children\u2019s Court (criminal division) and the Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal (VOCAT). Its aim is to provide new ways of dealing with crime and other social disorder, disadvantage and con/f_l  ict in the local area. It works to create a more integrated, responsive and accessible justice system by engaging the local community and addressing the underlying causes of offending.\nTo use the NJC, the accused must:\n\u00b7reside within the City of Yarra, or\n\u00b7be a homeless person who either lives in the area or is alleged to have committed theoffence in the area, or\n\u00b7be an Indigenous person with a close connection to the area and be alleged to havecommitted the offence in the area.\nThe NJC runs a unique process called Problem Solving to stop repeat offending by helping people address dif/f_i  culties with their current matter before the court and helping them generally get \u2018back on track\u2019. This can involve an out-of-court meeting of the Neighbourhood Justice Of/f_i  cer, the defendant, their legal representative and support person, to discuss the court matters and address the defendant\u2019s problems.\nThe NJC has one magistrate, so any \nperson who reoffends comes before the same magistrate. This bene/f_i  ts the accused, because the court has previous experience as well as knowledge of the individual and their circumstances. The magistrate also speaks directly to the accused, rather than through their legal representative, and the prosecution and defence counsel will often discuss the matter between themselves, rather than through the magistrate, to determine the best way to help the accused overcome his/her dif/f_i  culties and issues while receiving an appropriate/uni00A0sanction.\nFigure 3.5 Neighbourhood Justice Centre, Collingwood 62 Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law Chapter 3 Determining a criminal case 63\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

It works to create a more integrated, responsive and accessible justice system by engaging the local community and addressing the underlying causes of offending.\nTo use the NJC, the accused must:\n \u00b7reside within the City of Yarra, or\n \u00b7be a homeless person who either lives in the area or is alleged to have committed the offence in the area, or\n \u00b7be an Indigenous person with a close connection to the area and be alleged to have committed the offence in the area.\nThe NJC runs a unique process called Problem Solving to stop repeat offending by helping people address dif/f_i  culties with their current matter before the court and helping them generally get \u2018back on track\u2019. This can involve an out-of-court meeting of the Neighbourhood Justice Of/f_i  cer, the defendant, their legal representative and support person, to discuss the court matters and address the defendant\u2019s problems.\nThe NJC has one magistrate, so any \nperson who reoffends comes before the same magistrate. This bene/f_i  ts the accused, because the court has previous experience as well as knowledge of the individual and their circumstances. The magistrate also speaks directly to the accused, rather than through their legal representative, and the prosecution and defence counsel will often discuss the matter between themselves, rather than through the magistrate, to determine the best way to help the accused overcome his/her dif/f_i  culties and issues while receiving an appropriate/uni00A0sanction.\nFigure 3.5 Neighbourhood Justice Centre, Collingwood Chapter 3 Determining a criminal case 63\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

Mildura is the latest addition to the County Koori Court network.\nThe County Koori Court started as a four-year pilot \nprogram in 2009. An evaluation found that it provided for/uni00A0culturally relevant and appropriate justice. It was found that the experience of Indigenous defendants is vastly improved by the availability of this court: of the 15 who were interviewed, 14 said that it was more engaging, inclusive and less intimidating than the mainstream court.\nThese comments show the bene/f_i  ts of the \nMagistrates\u2019 Koori Court. They include:\n\u2022 Ownership: Increases Indigenous ownership of the administration of the law \u2013 breaks down the disengagement that Indigenous people have had with courts. O\ufb00  enders get a system that is far more meaningful to them and a system they can readily engage with. Rather than being adversarial, the process allows Elders and Respected Persons to help get to the cause of criminal behaviour. They can o\ufb00  er advice and address the defendant.\n\u2022 Community awareness: The court is seen as part of the community. They help people address and correct criminal behaviour within local Indigenous communities, and increase awareness about community codes of conduct and standards of behaviour.\u2022 Breaks the cycle: Reduces the likelihood of reo\ufb00  ending and entering a criminal career, and reduces the number of breached court orders. Sentencing alternatives can be explored. The role of Elders \u2018shaming\u2019 the o\ufb00  ender can be more e\ufb00  ective than a prison sentence, but Elders take no part in the sentencing. (O\ufb00  enders/uni00A0have already pleaded guilty \u2013 they are subject to the same penalties as mainstream courts: about 70% receive a custodial sentence.)\n\u2022 Personal hearings: There is no dominance of legal professionals, no hierarchies of traditional courtrooms; all participants are able to fully participate and to speak for themselves. Elders or Respected Persons, the Koori Court o\ufb03   cer (who has an integral role in protecting the community), the defendant and family can all/uni00A0contribute to the proceedings.\n\u2022 Easy understanding: There is no legal jargon \u2013/uni00A0just plain English.\n\u2022 Offender participation: Actively encourages the participation of the o\ufb00  ender and those who know him or/uni00A0her.\n\u2022 Victims: O\ufb00  enders cannot shy away from the Victim Impact Statement. They have to sit at the table and have what they did to the victim said to them from a metre or so away. This can be devastating.\n\u2022 Racial bias reduced: Community participation removes racial bias in the court.\n\u2022 Embrace: The justice system, including the police, and the broader local community, has embraced the/uni00A0courts.\nFigure 3.6 Indigenous smoking ceremony at the opening of the County Court in Mildura 64 Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

  "Page 77": "3.4   Institutions to assist \nan\u00a0accused\nOur criminal justice system is based on the presumption of innocence: an accused \nperson\u00a0is to be presumed innocent until their accuser proves them guilty \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019. It is regarded as essential that an accused has legal representation to help them prepare their defence. Legal representation can be expensive. This is one factor that limits the capacity of the criminal system to achieve justice. To address this concern, institutions such as Victoria Legal Aid and Community Legal Centres have been\u00a0established.\nThe following case highlights the importance of the need for legal representation.\nDIETRICH V THE QUEEN\n[1992] HCA 57\nIn 1988 the accused, Dietrich, was found guilty in the County Court of Victoria of \nimporting a traffi  cable quantity of heroin into Australia.\nBefore the trial, Dietrich had made unsuccessful applications to be represented \nby Victoria Legal Aid (VLA). However, VLA would not represent him unless he pleaded guilty . Dietrich also applied through Commonwealth legislation, to the Federal Minister for Justice and the Attorney-General, to have counsel appointed to his trial to represent him. These applications were also rejected. As a result, Dietrich was unrepresented at his trial. Also before the trial, Dietrich had argued that it should be adjourned or stayed (not proceed) until he had an opportunity to\u00a0get legal representation. The County Court refused those requests.\nAfter his trial, Dietrich applied for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal \non the basis that his trial was a miscarriage of justice as he did not have legal representation. The basis of the argument was that the lack of representation had denied him his right to a fair trial. The application to the Court of Appeal was dismissed.\nDietrich appealed to the High Court on the same basis.\nThe High Court allowed the appeal, holding that by not having legal \nrepresentation the accused was denied a fair trial. The decision of the majority \nof\u00a0the High Court was expressed by Mason CJ and McHugh J:\n\u2026 we identify what the majority considers to be the approach which should be \nadopted by a trial judge who is faced with an application for an adjournment or a stay by an indigent (i.e. \u2018needy\u2019) accused charged with a serious offence who, through no fault on his or her part, is unable to obtain legal representation. In that situation, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, the trial in such a case should be adjourned, postponed or stayed until legal representation is available. If, in those circumstances, an application that the trial be delayed is refused and, by reason of the lack of representation of the accused, the resulting trial is not a fair one, any conviction of the accused must be quashed by an appellate court for the reason that there has been a miscarriage of justice in that the accused has been convicted without a fair trial.\nDietrich was successful in his appeal to the High Court. The comments of the \nJustices were signifi  cant because of their implications for the provision of legal aid. That is:\n1 Access to legal representation is fundamental to the achievement of justice in \ncriminal law , and\n2 Governments have the responsibility to provide suffi  cient funds for legal \nservices, and their failure to do so may result in an indefi  nite stay of proceedings \nin trials for serious criminal\u00a0offences (that is, until representation is secured).Legal representation is \nconsidered necessary in our legal system.

This is a government-\nfunded agency established to ensure that Victorians who cannot afford to pay for a private lawyer can receive assistance with their legal problems. It has 14 offi  ces in metropolitan and regional Victoria and provides assistance to people on a range of legal issues, including criminal matters for adults and\u00a0children.\nVLA has lawyers and administrative personnel \non staff.

For example, there could be a con\ufb02  ict if an applicant claims to have no assets and very little income, but drives an expensive car.\nThe State reasonableness test applies to anyone who has a matter to be determined \nin the Magistrates\u2019 Court, or summarily in the Children\u2019s Court, or is appealing from the Magistrates\u2019 Court to the County Court.\nAn individual\u2019s lawyer or VLA must consider:\n\u2022 the nature and extent of any benefi  t which a grant of legal assistance might give to \nthe individual, the public or a sector of the public\n\u2022 the nature and extent of any detriment which a refusal of a grant might cause to the \nindividual, the public or a sector of the public.\nIf the application for assistance relates to a proceeding other than a criminal appeal, the \nVLA will consider whether the matter is likely to end up in favour of the individual and, if it is a criminal appeal, whether there are reasonable grounds for the appeal.\nVLA will also determine whether the person applying for a legal assistance grant can \nafford to pay the full costs of the legal services themselves. If a grant of assistance is made, VLA considers whether or not the person will be required to pay a contribution towards their legal costs.\n The means test does not apply to children who are to appear in the Children\u2019s Court \nor to a person involved in criminal proceedings under Part 5 of the Crimes (Mental Impairment and Un/f_i  tness to be Tried) Act 1997 (Vic).\nAccessibility and VLA\nVLA provides accessible information in a number of formats. The website has a \u2018Find Legal Answers\u2019. VLA operates a free telephone Legal Help line and referral service during\u00a0normal work hours.

  "Page 80": "  Legal brief 3.2\nRecent developments in the provision of legal\u00a0aid\nExpansion in means test criteria\nIn February 2016, the VLA announced a change in \nthe criteria for the means test which would allow an estimated additional 700 Victorians to receive legal aid. The changes were estimated to cost the VLA an additional $5 million over the next 5 years. \u2018This will help people who currently fall through the cracks,\u2019 the Executive of VLA said. \u2018Often people who do not qualify for legal aid, but cannot not afford a private lawyer, are forced to pay for representation on their credit cards or go without legal assistance.\u2019\nAccess to Justice Review\nIn October 2016 the Access to Justice Review was released. The aim of the review was to identify ways to improve access to justice of Victorians with \u2018everyday\u2019 problems. In addition, it aimed to ensure that the disadvantaged and vulnerable, and those with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander backgrounds, were able to receive the support they needed when engaging with the justice system.\nSixty recommendations were made, including that VLA \nshould become the primary entry point for information about legal issues and services in Victoria. Speci/f_i  cally, VLA should take the role of leading, assisting and coordinating with other services providing legal information. In addition, VLA should continue to set the guidelines for eligibility for legal assistance and make decisions on individual applications.\nIt also recommended that VLA should become the \nprimary entry point for online information about legal issues and services. This would include funding to expand the VLA website, particularly to:\n \u00b7introduce a live web-chat service\n \u00b7provide information in a wide range of languages and in an accessible format that can be integrated with VLA\u2019s Legal Help Line.\nVLA, the report said, should explore other ways in which technology can support its role as the main source of legal assistance.\nThe Commonwealth and State governments, the \nreport noted, need to grant funds on the basis of a longer time period \u2013 4 years \u2013 to improve the ability of the legal assistance sector to plan for the future.\nAnd /f_i  nally, the Victorian government and the courts \nshould work together to ensure the adequate availability of interpreter services. All staff of all courts should be educated to identify when interpreter services are required.\nCommunity Legal Centres (CLCs)\nCurrently there are over 50 CLCs in Victoria, staffed by paid and volunteer lawyers and \nothers. These centres receive funding mainly from the Commonwealth and Victorian governments, but they are also be part-funded by local councils, universities and other organisations. CLCs offer free advice and help for Victorians experiencing social and economic disadvantage. They can also determine eligibility for legal assistance and help the accused to complete the necessary applications for that assistance. They can also arrange (or provide) representation in court proceedings.\nMONASH-OAKLEIGH  LEGAL \nSERVICE (MOLS) AND THE \nSPRINGVALE MONASH  LEGAL \nSERVICE (SMLS)\nMonash University provides training for law students through the Monash-Oakleigh \nLegal Service (MOLS) and the Springvale Monash Legal Service (SMLS) CLCs, operating in partnership with Victoria Legal Aid. Disadvantaged members of the community can obtain free and confi  dential legal advice for minor criminal matters and other issues referred to the CLCs by the VLA. The CLCs are largely run by students, under the supervision of solicitors employed by Monash Law School, and volunteers from the legal industry , who also offer free advice.

If a client is able to pay for a private lawyer, an appropriate referral can be made. If court representation is required, the centre is able to arrange a barrister to appear on behalf of the client in court. Most barristers will appear for free or for a reduced fee, depending on the client\u2019s fi  nancial circumstances, the urgency of the case, the resources of the CLC\u2019s lawyer and the outcome of the application for legal assistance.\nFITZROY  LEGAL \nSERVICE\nThis community legal service, situated in the Fitzroy \nTown Hall, provides legal advice and representation, including a drop-in legal advice service for those who are charged with a criminal offence.

Barwon is undeniably un/f_i  t/uni00A0for children. Putting them in an adult jail/uni00A0is dangerous and sets a terrible precedent.\nThe Fitzroy Legal Service argued that the government:\u2022 acted unlawfully when sending the children to \nBarwon\n\u2022 failed to act in the best interests of the children in \nits/uni00A0care, and\n\u2022 breached the Victorian Charter of Human Rights \nand Responsibilities in sending the children to an adult/uni00A0prison.They were being locked in their cells for more than 20 hours per day. The spokesperson for the service said, \u2018evidence shows that exposing children to these conditions causes irreparable psychological damage\u2019 .\nEarlier, when a challenge on the same issue was \nbrought by the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service and the Human Rights Law Centre, the government had agreed not to hold Indigenous children in an adult prison.\nThe Supreme Court held that holding children in an \nadult prison was unlawful and that their human rights were at risk. Justice Garde ordered that the children be moved to a suitable youth facility by 4pm the following day. However, he later granted a stay on that order, at least till 28 December, and acknowledged that they had been sent to Barwon for/uni00A0emergency reasons and that there was nowhere else for them to go.\nFollowing an unsuccessful appeal to the Victorian \nCourt of Appeal, the Victorian government reclassi/f_i  ed a section of Barwon Prison as a youth justice facility. In May 2017, the Supreme Court again declared the detention of young o\ufb00  enders in an adult prison unlawful.

  "Page 85": "3.5  Committal proceedings\nBefore an indictable offence can proceed to a higher court, a committal hearing is \nconducted in the Magistrates\u2019 Court. This hearing is designed to establish whether the prosecution has a case against the defendant. The prosecution must establish that there is a prima facie (at fi  rst appearance) case or suffi  cient evidence against the defendant to support a conviction by a jury in a higher court. If that is proven, the case can proceed to trial. If\u00a0there is not suffi  cient evidence to support a conviction, the defendant is discharged.\nThe committal hearing also allows the defendant to see the prosecution\u2019s evidence \nagainst them. There are two types of procedure that can be followed: the traditional committal hearing (including the committal mention system) or the \u2018hand-up brief\u2019.\nThe Criminal Procedures Act 2009 (Vic) limits the cross-examination of some witnesses \nat a committal. These include:\n\u2022 victims of a sexual offence\n\u2022 children\u2022 persons with cognitive impairment (such as mental illness, intellectual disability , \ndementia or brain injury)\n\u2022 a witness who has made a statement which has been included in a hand-up brief \nor has given testimony in examination-in-chief. These people cannot be cross-\nexamined at a committal.\nThe purposes of committal hearings are:\n\u2022 determining whether there is evidence of suffi  cient weight to support a conviction \nfor the offence charged\n\u2022 determining whether a charge for an offence is appropriate to be heard and \ndetermined summarily\n\u2022 determining how an accused proposes to plead\n\u2022 ensuring that the prosecution\u2019s case is adequately disclosed\u2022 ensuring that the accused can hear the evidence against him/her and \ncross-examine\u00a0witnesses\n\u2022 enabling an accused to put forward a case at an early stage\u2022 enabling the issues in contention to be adequately defi  ned.\nCommittal mention system\nThe Magistrates\u2019 Court uses the mention system for dealing with committals. It is designed \nto identify cases in which a defendant intends to plead guilty . This provides for the more \neffi  cient operation of the court system and avoids unnecessary delays. A defendant is not required to enter a plea at the committal mention. However, if a defendant pleads guilty at the committal mention hearing, a date will be set for the case to be heard in a higher court and for the offender to be sentenced. Approximately 30% of all defendants indicate at the committal mention stage that they intend to plead guilty . If the committal is contested \u2013 that is, if the defendant pleads not guilty \u2013 the magistrate will require information about:\n\u2022 the number of witnesses to be called\n\u2022 the likely length of the hearing.\nThe magistrate may then:\n\u2022 adjourn the hearing of the committal proceeding to enable the defendant to obtain \nlegal representation\n\u2022 set a date for a contested committal mention (in some cases)\u2022 set a date for a committal hearing in the Magistrates\u2019 Court\u2022 conduct a committal proceeding immediately (if the magistrate believes that there \nis suffi  cient evidence).A committal mention \nidenti/f_i  es those cases in which the defendant intends to plead guilty.

  "Page 86": "\u2018Hand-up brief\u2019\nThe main purpose of the hand-up brief is to inform defendants of the case against them. \nThis saves court time, as the defendant is then in a position to make an informed decision \nabout whether they will plead guilty or not guilty (this is called contesting the committal). The entire committal procedure can be conducted by a hand-up brief. This means taking written sworn statements instead of oral evidence at the hearing. At least 42 days before the committal mention hearing, the Crown will notify the defendant that it intends to use a hand-up brief. Copies of the charge sheet, sworn statements, photographs and other material that is to be used as evidence by the prosecution are served on (sent to) the\u00a0defendant.\nAt least 14 days before the date of the committal mention hearing, the defendant must \nnotify the prosecution if he or she intends to question prosecution witnesses. The court must consent to the cross-examination of witnesses if there is to be a contested committal hearing (if the defendant is going to plead not guilty). If the defendant does not want to question any of the prosecution witnesses during the committal process, the deposition alone is presented to the court. Based on the deposition, the magistrate decides whether the case should be committed for trial. Today , most committal examinations are conducted by hand-up brief.\nCommittal hearing\nA committal hearing begins with the defendant\u2019s name being called and the charge being \nread out. The defendant does not have to enter a plea at this stage. The prosecution calls witnesses who are examined (this is the examination-in-chief), cross-examined (by the defence) and re-examined (by the prosecution). Witnesses are examined under oath. The evidence from each witness is recorded in writing. All the evidence presented by the prosecution is collected in a single document, known as a deposition.\nAfter the evidence for the prosecution is heard, the defendant will be given an \nopportunity to call witnesses and make submissions. A defendant who wishes to plead not guilty must decide whether to present a defence at the committal hearing or to reserve it for the trial. Usually , the defence case is not heard at the committal hearing. If the defendant does present a defence, the process used is identical to that involving the prosecution witnesses. This also forms part of the deposition. After all the evidence has been heard, the court decides whether there is suffi  cient evidence to support a conviction in a higher court. If it decides that there is not, the case is dismissed and the defendant is discharged. If there is a case to answer, the defendant will be directed to stand trial in a higher court.Most committals are \nconducted as hand-up briefs, where written documents are used instead of hearing witnesses.\nA committal hearing involves the hearing of the prosecution case in court. The defendant may elect to not present a defence. 78 Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 87": "NEWSREPORT  3.5\nJustice delayed, justice denied: court overhaul overdue\nCommittal hearings are rightly under review\nJUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED, SOMEONE  \nsaid once. It may have been William Gladstone or \nWilliam Penn, but whatever its origins, the phrase has become both a legal maxim and a clich\u00e9, because it is so true. Victims of crime and those accused of crime all deserve access to a speedy trial and, hopefully, resolution. Lately, the maxim has become a rallying call for those who believe an overburdened, complex, ponderous and ever more expensive judicial system denies that justice and needs signi/f_i  cant, perhaps root-and-branch, reform.\nIn Victoria the element of the court system most \nopen to such reform is committal hearings, the /f_i  rst in a two-step process of taking a criminal matter to a verdict. Here, all criminal prosecutions destined for the County or Supreme Courts /f_i  rst come before a magistrate who holds a committal hearing to assess whether there is su\ufb03   cient evidence to send the case to trial. Committals are meant to be a /f_i  lter, ensuring that, on the evidence, cases with little chance of success are not sent before a jury. Directors of public prosecutions (DPPs) can of course still choose to take matters directly to court.\nFormer DPP Jeremy Rapke QC was calling for the \nabolition of committals 5 years ago, arguing that they were a waste of time and money and clogged up the court system. They were no longer properly serving the /f_i  ltering process for which they were originally created and were costly, ine\ufb03   cient and time-wasting. Abolishing committals would eliminate much of the delay between when an accused was charged and when the trial was /f_i  nally heard. Now, it seems, the state government may be/uni00A0leaning towards a similar view.\nAs The Sunday Age revealed today, the government \nis considering scrapping committal hearings in what would be one of the most signi/f_i  cant overhauls of our judicial system. Attorney-General Robert Clark has been/uni00A0meeting with the courts, the DPP and Legal Aid to discuss possible reforms to the committal system. Already critics are suggesting that if it goes as far as abolition, the results would be \u2018disastrous\u2019 . But even they agree that the committal hearing process needs a remake. That is also The Sunday Age\u2019s view. Mr Clark says: \u2018some form of \u2026 preliminary hearing or scrutiny of serious criminal charges/uni00A0needs to be available\u2019 , but committals have become too loosely controlled, duplicate much of what must happen at the trial stage, run for too long and, in many cases, turn into something of a lawyers\u2019 picnic.\n\u2018Coulda, woulda, shoulda\u2019 is also a clich\u00e9, if a far less \nelegant one. But the di\ufb00  erence between the /f_i  rst two words is at the heart of what could be the most e\ufb00  ective reform to committals. At present magistrates must be satis/f_i  ed that there is reasonable prospect that a properly instructed jury could convict a charged person. If, as Chief/uni00A0Magistrate Ian Gray suggests, that word were replaced with would, fewer cases with little chance of success would be sent to trial. We would also support tightening and controlling cross-examination in the Magistrates\u2019 Courts. Too often these days witnesses \u2013 and too often there are too many of those \u2013 are cross-examined on matters where there is little dispute about their evidence, or that are covered in their statements.\nIn Magistrates\u2019 Courts new duties now take up \nincreasing time, such as family violence intervention orders, which have grown 48% in the last /f_i  ve years. Committal hearings remain an important part of the justice safety net. They screen out cases where the evidence is not strong enough and allow accused people to know what they are facing at trial and decide whether to plead guilty or not guilty. But the process needs to be streamlined and unclogged. And our message to Mr Clark is: Without delay.\nSydney Morning Herald, 22 July 2012\n3.6  Pre-trial negotiations\nThe settlement of criminal disputes is an important part of obtaining justice for the victim, \ntheir family , the accused and the community in general. The use of plea negotiations and sentence indications has attracted more attention than almost any other part of the criminal justice system. Many legal practitioners argue that they are an important, though controversial, part of reducing delays and costs for both parties and stress for the victim. A lack of transparency for the community and victim until after the process is completed, however, along with the fact that the sentencing judge may not be given information about all the aggravating factors (an aggravating factor is something that makes the crime worse), means that there are now many dissenters.

  "Page 88": "WHAT FACTORS WILL INFLUENCE AN \nOFFENDER  TO\u00a0PLEAD GUILTY?\nIn most criminal cases in Victoria the accused person enters a guilty plea. According to the Sentencing \nAdvisory Council, in the period 2009\u201314, almost 72% of criminal cases in the Supreme Court, and nearing 85% in the County Court, resulted in a plea of guilty without going to trial, or a plea of guilty being entered during the trial. For instance, if a suspect makes a full admission about their involvement in the offence during an interview with police, it is likely that they will plead guilty at the trial. In such a case there is no need for adjudication, and the role of the court is to determine the sanction that should apply . \nPlea negotiations\nPlea negotiations are informal processes between the defendant and his/her legal \nrepresentative and the prosecution.\nAfter the investigation of an offence, a number of decisions will be made. These \ndecisions include whether to charge the suspect, and if so, what the charge or charges should be. In a number of cases, the charges initially fi  led are not those that are eventually proceeded with. For example, if a person charged with a number of offences decides to plead guilty to some of them, the prosecution has the discretion to not proceed with the other charges.\nCommonly , the accused and his/her legal representative will negotiate with the \nprosecution, offering to plead guilty to an offence with a lower penalty if the more serious offence is withdrawn. Alternatively , the accused may choose to plead guilty to the more serious charge if an agreement can be reached about the facts on which the plea is based. In some cases, after the accused has been committed to trial, the Crown may decide not to proceed with the case.\nIn many cases, the charge is clearly appropriate to the facts of the case, and the guilty \nplea can be seen as justifi  ed. In other cases, however, the police may \u2018overcharge\u2019. This means that the police lay more charges than necessary , because they expect that some of the charges will be withdrawn during pre-trial negotiations in exchange for a plea of guilty to the remaining charges.\nControversy can arise when the accused has negotiated a charge to a lesser crime \nthan the one set out in the original charge.\nAppropriateness of plea negotiations\nTo many , the process of plea negotiations looks like a \u2018win-win\u2019 situation. The prosecution secures a conviction, avoids the costs to the taxpayer of an expensive trial, and saves the victims of crime the trauma of appearing in court. Plea negotiation does indeed do this: it streamlines the \ufb02  ow of cases by producing guilty pleas, thus saving court time.\nThe essence of any plea negotiation is to hasten the normal process, but at what cost? \nThe potential for injustice to the defendant, the victim and the community can be great. An\u00a0unprepared or inexperienced lawyer could advise a client to accept a plea negotiation when there may be the chance of an acquittal. The prosecution may go ahead with a lesser charge rather than prosecute for a more serious offence. A prosecution for a more serious offence may require lengthy argument, and the calling of many witnesses \u2013 this means considerable expense. Plea negotiation can be seen as a path to easy solutions to cases. However, how effective is our legal system if plea negotiation discourages an accused from exercising their right to a fair hearing?\nCritics of plea negotiations refer to the benefi  ts it gives to the defendant. They \nargue that plea negotiations \u2018soften\u2019 the deterrent effect of punishment because it gives criminal defendants the power to bargain for a lesser punishment. Some argue that more experienced criminals are more likely to receive favourable plea negotiations because they are familiar with the criminal law system. This operates against the idea that a criminal should receive a punishment that fi  ts the crime. 80 Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

There are currently no legislative guidelines to plea negotiation procedures.\nPlea negotiations save costs to the taxpayer. The victim does not get to testify against the accused so justice is not seen to be done.\nThe victim is saved the prolonged proceedings of a trial. If it was a violent crime, for example, it means they do not have to go through the circumstances again, including cross-examination by the defence counsel.Criminals who have committed serious crimes are back in the community earlier, having received a reduced sentence.\nNEWSREPORT  3.6\nPlea bargaining, a matter of negotiation\nPLEA BARGAINING IS WHEN A DEFENDANT PLEADS  \nguilty to a lesser charge in order to be given a more \nlenient sentence. It is an important part of the criminal justice system, but not without controversy.\nThere was community shock when a plea negotiation \nwas used by gangland bosses Carl Williams and Tony Mokbel. Williams pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and three counts of murder on a plea deal with the Victorian O\ufb03   ce of Public Prosecutions [OPP]; Mokbel was sentenced on drug tra\ufb03   cking o\ufb00  ences after pleading guilty following a deal with the OPP , which allegedly included the withdrawal of eight additional drug-related charges and other charges related to his involvement in up to three murders.\nHowever, Victoria\u2019s OPP /f_i  rmly believes in plea \nbargaining, saying that by using this negotiation process, the backlog of criminal o\ufb00  ences is reduced. It claims that the justice system is not undermined \u2013 arrangements reached in each case are based on justice, not expediency. They will re/f_l  ect the evidence in the particular case and the charges the prosecutor thinks are appropriate.\nSettlement of criminal cases can have positive e\ufb00  ects \nfor victims and their relatives, for the accused, and for the community\u2019s continued level of con/f_i  dence in the criminal justice system.\nThere are a number of advantages in negotiating an \nappropriate settlement in criminal cases:\n\u2022 Because the defendant has pleaded guilty, there is \ncertainty of the outcome for the prosecution and the/uni00A0community.\n\u2022 It saves victims and witnesses the trauma of the \nadversarial process;\n\u2022 Valuable community resources are used e\ufb03   ciently. \nAccording to the OPP , each plea saves the justice system (and victims and witnesses) a trial. On average, a trial uses 7\u201310 days of court time, compared to about one day for a plea.\u2022 As a proportion of matters completed by the OPP , \nplea negotiations are growing signi/f_i  cantly, with a corresponding fall in the proportion of cases going to trial.\n\u2022 A 5% shift in completions from trials to pleas can \nreduce the number of trials by about 25 a year, saving/uni00A0some 175 trial court days. It is estimated that a day in court costs about $20,000 \u2013 this amounts to/uni00A0roughly $3.5 million.\n\u2022 Decisions regarding plea negotiations are made \naccording to the Direction of Public Prosecution\u2019s (the/uni00A0DPP\u2019s) policy guidelines, with checks and balances, and in consultation with those involved.\nThe disadvantages are:\u2022 It undermines the principles of public and open \njustice, where justice is seen to be done and the public has access to criminal proceedings.\n\u2022 The lack of transparency can create perceptions of \nunfairness, of hidden justice. The motives for plea negotiations can be unclear to the public, and to victims. Victims may not be kept informed of the status of the case and may believe that the gravity of the case is being lessened. For instance, during a bail hearing in the NSW Supreme Court, the judge criticised the DPP after learning that an o\ufb00  er had been made to reduce kidnapping charges against a man in \u2018secret negotiations\u2019 so that the case could be dealt with in the Local Court. The judge was later advised that the DPP would not continue with the plea negotiation.

Discuss.\nCRIMINAL JUSTICE DIVERSION  PROGRAM\nThe Diversion Program is a way of taking a matter out of court, and avoids a plea of guilty . It\u00a0is also a\u00a0chance to avoid a criminal record. The\u00a0emphasis is on keeping the accused out of the\u00a0criminal justice\u00a0system and focusing instead on\u00a0their\u00a0rehabilitation.\nThe informant (usually a police offi  cer) needs\u00a0to \ngive the accused a diversion recommendation and the magistrate will then decide if the accused is eligible. If the magistrate agrees, the accused is placed on a diversion plan, which has conditions. These conditions are normally in place for 12 months, and may include:\n \u00b7writing a letter of apology to any victim\n \u00b7making a donation\n \u00b7attending counselling (such as for anger management), doing a drug or alcohol awareness course, or a driving course\n \u00b7doing community work.\nIf the conditions of the plan are followed, the police will drop the charges and there will be no fi  nding of guilt and therefore no criminal record.\nYou may be eligible for diversion if your offence:\n \u00b7is to be heard in the Magistrates\u2019 Court\n \u00b7does not have a minimum or fi  xed sentence or penalty , and\n \u00b7you agree that you were responsible for the crime (this is not a plea of guilty).\nThe Diversion Program is usually for a fi  rst offence that is not too serious: for example, criminal damage, careless driving or minor theft. It will not be available for excessive speeding, driving while under the in\ufb02  uence of drugs or alcohol or refusing to take a drug or alcohol test. If the offence is a traffi  c offence, the accused will still get the demerit points.\nIf an accused wishes to take part in/uni00A0a Diversion Program\nThe accused needs to ask for a diversion before they attend the Magistrates\u2019 Court. They need to write a letter asking to take part in the program. The letter should include details about the accused including, for example, whether or not they have apologised to any victim, and whether it is their fi  rst offence. Institutions such as the VLA and CLCs can help the accused with what should be included.\nThe accused will be interviewed by a diversion \ncoordinator. This offi  cer will write to any victim involved in the offence to fi  nd out if they want the accused on the program. If the victim does not want the accused to take part in the program, the accused will not receive a diversion plan.\nIn court the accused should ask the magistrate \nfor a diversion plan, and should have documents with them that support their suitability . These should include character references, receipts for payment of any damages incurred in the crime, and reports from doctors or counsellors they have seen.\nIf a diversion plan is made and the accused fails to \ncomply with the conditions, they will return to court, where the magistrate may reinstate the plan. If the magistrate does not do this, the accused will need to have the offence heard in the court. 82 Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 91": "Sentence indication\nA sentence indication scheme is another way of encouraging people to plead guilty early . \nEarly guilty pleas save court time and costs, as well as sparing victims stress.\nSentencing indication allows an accused person, or their legal representative, to request an \nindication from the judge as to whether they are likely to receive a custodial or a non-custodial \nsentence if the accused pleads guilty . Under this scheme a judge or magistrate would indicate to an accused person, before a trial was to start, what kind of sentence discount they would receive in return for a guilty plea. The Criminal Procedure Act 2009 (Vic) provides that:\n\u2022 If a non-custodial indication is given, and the accused pleads guilty at the next \navailable opportunity (either immediately after the indication or at the next pre-trial hearing), this is then binding on the judge in sentencing, so a custodial sentence cannot be given.\n\u2022 If a person pleads guilty after a custodial indication is given, this can be changed \nto a non-custodial penalty after the revelation of all material at a later plea hearing examination.\n\u2022 If an indication is given, but the accused does not plead guilty , the case must be \nrelisted with a different judge, unless all parties agree otherwise.\nVictorian courts must take into account a guilty plea, and its timing, when determining an\u00a0appropriate sentence.\nThere have been criticisms of the sentencing indication scheme, including:\n\u2022 The negative impact on victims of being unable to \u2018have their day in court\u2019 and \nfeeling that the accused has been given a light sentence.\n\u2022 Much of the accused\u2019s mitigating circumstances (things that might result in a lower \nsentence) and aggravating factors (things that might result in a higher sentence) \n\u2013 such as their personal circumstances at the time of the offence, any psychiatric and/or intellectual problems, drug addiction, remorse, acts of reparation (making amends for a wrong that has been done) \u2013 may be unknown to the judge at the time\u00a0of making the indication.\n\u2022 Society\u2019s increasing pressure for harsh sentences may not be re\ufb02  ected in \nsentence\u00a0indications.\n\u2022 Court ineffi  ciency may be being prioritised above the interests of justice.\nThe scheme has also been criticised for its apparent incompatibility with other legislation, in particular the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic), which provides that people charged with a criminal offence must \u2018not be compelled \u2026 to confess guilt\u2019. This point was made in the Victorian Parliament (Parliamentary Debates: Legislative Assembly , 6 December 2007, 4348):\nWhat this legislation will do is introduce a system where people who are \ndisadvantaged and not able to make the judgements which are so fundamental to their future will be under enormous pressure to plead guilty , simply because they think that course of action is better than going to trial.\nThe judge is also required to make a statement when giving an indication that a more \nsevere sentence is likely if the case proceeds. This could be interpreted by the accused as\u00a0a suggestion that they should plead guilty immediately , or face a more severe sentence. If a defendant does not have legal representation, this pressure may mean an innocent person pleads guilty .\nActivity 3.4  Folio exercise\nPre-trial negotiations\n1 De/f_i  ne the term \u2018justice\u2019.\n2 Explain how pre-trial plea negotiations and sentence indications affect the elements of fairness, equality \nand access and the achievement of justice in the criminal law/uni00A0system.\n3 Evaluate the process of plea negotiation and sentence indication.A sentence indication \nallows a judge or magistrate to indicate to the accused whether they are likely to receive a/uni00A0custodial or a non-custodial sentence.

  "Page 92": "3.7  Roles in the criminal trial\nThe key personnel in a criminal trial are the judge, the jury , the prosecution, the accused \nand legal practitioners. They all have important responsibilities during the trial.\nResponsibilities of the judge\nThe judge is responsible for ensuring that both parties obey the rules of court procedure. \nOne important function of the judge is to ensure that the party who bears the burden of proving the case \u2013 the prosecution \u2013 has legally satisfi  ed this responsibility .\nWhere there is a judge and a jury , the judge does not reach a decision as to guilt. At the \nend of the hearing the judge presents a summary of the evidence, the issues presented by the parties and the relevant law to the jury . When doing this, the judge must act impartially and treat each party equally and fairly . The judge is responsible for the following.\n\u2022 Deciding the admissibility of evidence: The judge may exclude inadmissible evidence, such as hearsay (a statement made out of court that is used in court to prove the truth of something: if X says, in court, that Y told her Z, and Y is not in court to be asked about Z, X\u2019s evidence about Z is hearsay , and will be excluded) or similar fact evidence (evidence about the accused\u2019s past bad acts: an accused\u2019s past convictions cannot generally be used as evidence in a court case). This evidence may prejudice the jury\u2019s fi  nal decision.\n\u2022 The selection and empanelling of a jury: The judge is responsible for the process through which a jury is selected and empanelled.\n\u2022 Safeguarding the rules of procedure: The judge must ensure that each party acts according to the rules of procedure.\n\u2022 Deciding all questions of law: Although each party may present evidence to suggest the relevant law that applies to their case, the ultimate decision as to the relevant law is the judge\u2019s. In a criminal case, the judge is also responsible for deciding the consequences of breaking the law; that is, deciding the appropriate\u00a0sanction.\n\u2022 Deciding questions of fact when there is no jury: In the Magistrates\u2019 Court, for example, the magistrate performs the role of both judge and jury . The magistrate decides if the facts have been proven and how the law applies to those facts. Once these two issues have been decided, the magistrate reaches a decision (verdict). In\u00a0the County Court or the Supreme Court, where a jury is present, the jury is the trier of facts. The jury must decide the facts of the case and how the law , as prescribed by the judge, applies to the facts.\n\u2022 Deciding the sanction: In a criminal case where the defendant has been found guilty , the judge decides the sanction.\nThe judge presides over \nthe court. 84 Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 93": "The judge is not allowed to intervene unnecessarily in the conduct of the case. The judge \nmust remain neutral and cannot assist the parties in the presentation of the case, either to \nprompt a party to ask a particular question of a witness or to introduce a legal issue. The judge must listen carefully to all the evidence presented by both parties.\nThe judge can only ask questions of witnesses when it is necessary to clear up any \npoint that has been overlooked or obscured. The impartiality of the judge in a trial is seen as the key to ensuring that justice is being done. Justice includes the concept that every individual will be treated fairly and equally . This can only be achieved if the judge is an impartial observer of the contest.\nResponsibilities of the jury\nThe use of juries is based on the idea that you have the right to be judged by your peers. \nThe word \u2018peer\u2019 comes from a Latin word meaning equal. To be judged by your peers means to be judged by persons with the same legal standing \u2013 ordinary members of the community . Juries are made up of ordinary men and women of the community . The jury system also re\ufb02  ects the idea that everyone in a community is responsible for the administration of justice.\nWhen a trial is expected to continue for an extended period, the judge may empanel \n15 jurors; but only 12 take part in reaching the verdict. The accused (or counsel for the accused) has a right to peremptory challenges or challenges for cause. With peremptory challenges, the accused does not have to give any reason for challenging the juror. Jurors whose names and occupations or numbers are called must walk across the courtroom, past the accused (who is in the dock) and be seated in the jury box. During this time, either party has the right to challenge the prospective juror. Challenges must be made before the juror is seated in the jury box.\nThe accused has the right to challenge peremptorily:\n\u2022 six jurors if only one person is arraigned (on trial)\n\u2022 fi  ve jurors if two people are arraigned\u2022 four jurors if more than two people are arraigned.\nThe Crown has the right to stand aside jurors in criminal trials. The Crown can stand\u00a0aside:\n\u2022 six jurors if only one person is arraigned\u2022 10 jurors if two people are arraigned\u2022 four jurors for each person arraigned if more than two people are arraigned.\nThe accused and the Crown also have a right to an unlimited number of challenges for \ncause. A challenge for cause is one where there is a good reason for the juror not being selected. Challenges for cause are rare. The judge hears all challenges. Where there has been a challenge for cause, the judge must decide whether the reasons given for the challenge are valid. Potential jurors who have been challenged return to the jury pool.\nIn summary , the jury performs the following functions:\n\u2022 attends the trial for as long as required\u2022 listens to all evidence and submissions presented by counsel for both sides\u2022 remembers, collates and analyses arguments presented for both sides\u2022 decides questions of fact\u2022 follows instructions given by the judge on questions of evidence, procedure and \npoints of law\n\u2022 follows the judge\u2019s direction, if issued, to acquit the accused\u2022 takes note of the judge\u2019s fi  nal summary of the case\u2022 reaches and delivers a verdict.\nIn criminal cases, the verdict must be \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 if the accused is to be \nfound guilty .The role of the judge is \nto be independent and impartial.\nA jury of 12 is used in criminal trials (that is, for indictable offences) in the County Court and Supreme Court in which the accused pleads not guilty.\nIn 2017 the Justice Legislation Amendment (Court Security, Juries and other matters) Act reduced peremptory challenges from six to three and prosecution stand asides from six to three.

Imagine sitting in the jury box and being confronted with graphic and horri/f_i  c evidence. Imagine trying to put aside your emotions in an e\ufb00  ort to be fair in reaching a verdict. Imagine how things heard during the trial could haunt you. Being a juror in any case is not easy. For some jurors, particularly those hearing murder cases, the experience can be traumatic. This can be the result of carrying out a civic duty, for a juror.\nSnowtown murder case\nSuch was the trauma caused by the Snowtown murder trial that some of the jurors were counselled during the proceedings. Justice Brian Martin, of the South Australian Supreme Court, warned jurors not to think about the case. After leaving the court, they were addressed by a psychiatrist. Ongoing counselling was arranged for jurors, court o\ufb03   cials and sta\ufb00   who saw and heard the evidence.\nThe jurors saw photographs of the autopsies of \neight murder victims whose bodies had been kept in barrels. They heard what was found in barrels \u2013 large pieces of skin, matted knots of hair, a kneecap, bones, dismembered torsos, bodies slashed, tortured and cut. They heard evidence of the screams of victims as they were tortured. They heard of toes being crushed with pliers. One victim was decapitated and had her arms cut o\ufb00  .\nThis trial concerned the murder of 11 of the 13 \nvictims. The killings were uncovered when police found eight rotting and dismembered bodies in six barrels inside a former bank in Snowtown, a country town north of Adelaide. Two other bodies were discovered in an Adelaide backyard two days later. Another man, whose body was found hanging from a tree, also became part of the murder count, as did the remains of a young man whose bones were discovered in 1994 but were identi/f_i  ed only /f_i  ve years later.\nFour jurors were excused during the 11-month \ntrial, which cost $15 million. South Australia\u2019s /f_i  rst fully/uni00A0electronic courtroom was established to deal with the evidence, which included more than 1000 exhibits and resulted in 16,000 pages of court transcript. A/uni00A0total of 228 witnesses, many related to the alleged killers and the victims, were called. (At/uni00A0the/uni00A0end, the jury was hung.)\nJaidyn Leskie case\nAcross the border in Victoria, jurors in the trial of Greg Domaszewicz heard about the death of toddler Jaidyn Leskie. The Domaszewicz jury consisted of eight men and four women. They came from a panel of 60. Twenty-/f_i  ve asked to be excused. They were aged between early 20s and late 60s, and English-speaking. When asked by Justice Frank Vincent if any others had second thoughts, three more asked to be excused. The defence counsel challenged /f_i  ve members, and all were indeed rejected. The Crown made no challenges. One of the 12 jurors was excused late in the trial following the death of a relative.\nBoth of these shocking cases captured the \nattention of the nation.\nCivic duty\nIt is a civic duty to be a juror. Jurors come from and represent the community in which they live. They are there to re/f_l  ect the values and moral codes of their community. It is not a glamorous job. The pay is lousy. Thanks are few \u2013 the judge may speak of a \u2018valuable contribution\u2019 at the end of the trial. Jurors will leave the court from a side door and may bid each other goodbye. That\u2019s it!\nStress factors\nStudies report that jurors can experience stress. There can be rage, depression, /f_l  ashbacks, nightmares, irritability and sleeplessness. A study by the University of NSW and the Justice Research Centre found that jurors experienced frustration due to time delays and not receiving all the relevant information about the case. They also had concerns about time, accommodation and food.\nStress factors for jurors can be multiple. They may \ninclude dealing with gruesome or graphic evidence, media attention, fear of revenge by the defendant, the length of the trial, community response, lack of anonymity in country locations, the personalities and group dynamics of the jury, and the sense of community responsibility. It is important to note that in Victoria, counselling and debrie/f_i  ng is now o\ufb00  ered to jurors.

The system is regarded as a very important institution.\nThe High Court\u2019s Justice Deane has probably given the best defence of the \njury system. In the decision in Kingswell v The Queen (1985) 159 CLR 264, he said that the \u2018rationale and the essential function\u2019 of trial by jury is \u2018the protection of the citizen against those who customarily exercise the authority of government: legislators \u2026 administrators \u2026 judges\u2019 .\nHe continued:\nTrial by jury also brings important practical bene/f_i  ts to the administration of \ncriminal justice. A system of criminal law cannot be attuned to the needs of the people whom it exists to serve unless its administration, proceedings and judgments are comprehensible by both the accused and the general public and have the appearance, as well as the substance, of being impartial and just. In a legal system where the question of criminal guilt is determined by a jury of ordinary citizens, the participating lawyers are constrained to present the evidence and issues in a manner that can be understood by laymen. The result is that the accused and the public can follow and understand the proceedings. Equally important, the presence and function of a jury in a criminal trial and the well-known tendency of jurors to identify and side with a fellow-citizen who is, in their view, being denied a \u2018fair go\u2019 tend to ensure observance of the consideration and respect to which ordinary notions of fair play entitle an accused or a witness. Few lawyers with practical experience in criminal matters would deny the importance of the institution of the jury to the maintenance of the appearance, as well as the substance, of impartial justice in criminal cases.\nCourtesy of the High Court of Australia\nThe prosecution and the accused\nIn a criminal case, the accused and the prosecutor are responsible for presenting the \nrelevant facts to support their case.

If they plead guilty , \nissues relating to the sentencing of the accused may be raised in court.\nIn presenting their case, each party decides which arguments they intend to rely on \nand selects the evidence that supports these arguments. In a criminal trial of an indictable offence, the prosecution must present the bulk of this evidence at the time of committal. The defendant is under no obligation to disclose evidence at the committal hearing.\nTHE ROLE OF THE DDP\nThe Offi  ce of Public Prosecutions (OPP) prepares \nand conducts prosecutions for the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).

In exceptional circumstances, the DPP can put aside a decision by a Magistrates\u2019 Court not to commit a case for trial and present the accused for trial.\nPreparing the indictment\nAll evidence presented during the committal process is recorded and collected: this is called a deposition. The deposition is forwarded to the DPP and the Criminal Trial Listing Directorate. At this time, a request is made by the court to the DPP for the indictment, any prior convictions of the defendant, any other prosecution witnesses intended to be called and any other documentation intended to be\u00a0used.A Crown prosecutor assesses the deposition \nand\u00a0refers the case to the Solicitor-General.

It usually contains the same charge that appeared in the deposition, but the Crown prosecutor can add new or further charges if\u00a0it is considered appropriate.\nDiscontinuing a prosecution\nIf the Crown prosecutor considers that the prosecution\u2019s evidence is not strong enough, the Attorney-General will be advised to discontinue\u00a0the\u00a0prosecution. This was previously known as a nolle prosequi. It \u2018discontinues\u2019 proceedings without actually acquitting the defendant. The matter can be recommenced if further evidence becomes available.\n Chapter 3 Determining a criminal case 91\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

The accused is responsible for arranging and paying for this. A solicitor will provide advice and will prepare the case (a \u2018brief\u2019) for a barrister. The barrister is a member of the Bar and will present the case in court.\nIf a person does not hire a lawyer to present their case, they may be disadvantaged. \nLawyers and barristers have expertise in presenting cases in court and may be able to present a more persuasive argument than an individual who does not have any experience with court processes.

If\u00a0the sentence is delayed, the accused may be remanded in custody or released on bail.\nPleading not guilty\nA not guilty plea lengthens the trial process, because the case is heard by a judge and 12 jurors. Following a plea of not guilty a jury will be empanelled. The role of the jury is to decide whether the prosecution has proven that the accused is guilty \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019.

  "Page 102": "The process of a criminal trial\nProsecution opening\nThe prosecution starts with a summary of the case. This summary explains:\n\u2022 the nature of the alleged offences\n\u2022 the elements that must be proved by the Crown\u2022 the evidence that the prosecution will be presenting to the court in order to prove \nthe charges against the defendant.\nDefence response\nThe defence presents a response to the prosecution opening. This response must outline \nthe issues in the trial and identify those facts that are not contested (that is, the facts the \ntwo sides agree on). This should be consistent with what was disclosed or identifi  ed in the pre-trial stages. The trial judge may limit the length of the prosecution opening or the defence response.\nAddress to the jury\nImmediately after the defence response to the prosecution opening, or at any other time the trial judge thinks appropriate, the trial judge may address the jury on:\n\u2022 the issues in the trial\n\u2022 the relevance to the conduct of the trial of any admissions made, directions given or \nmatters determined before the start of the trial.\nProsecution case\nBefore any witnesses are called, the court may \u2018order out\u2019 witnesses (ask them to leave the \ncourtroom). Prosecution witnesses are then called, one at a time. Witnesses are examined-in-chief (by the prosecution), cross-examined (by the defence) and re-examined (by the prosecution). The rules of evidence are complex. The judge will decide whether questions or evidence are admissible. Court rules also govern how barristers question witnesses. Some evidence is not allowed in criminal trials because it is considered prejudicial to the accused. For instance, as a general rule, evidence about previous convictions can only be introduced after the jury reaches a verdict. Evidence about previous convictions is used to help the judge determine the appropriate sentence. In some cases, the court can allow information about previous criminal convictions of defendants. This type of evidence is known as \u2018propensity\u2019 evidence. For instance, the prosecution may want to present evidence about previous convictions for violent offences to demonstrate that the accused has a propensity for (tendency towards, or habit of) violent behaviour.\n\u2018No case\u2019 application\nAt the end of the prosecution\u2019s evidence, the defence may argue that there is no case to answer. If the judge agrees, the jury will be directed to acquit the accused.\nDefence case\nIf the case is still proceeding, the defence can then present witnesses. Defence witnesses are examined in the same way as prosecution witnesses. The accused can remain silent. The judge (and jury) and the prosecution cannot draw any inference from this: the fact that the defendant has decided not to give evidence cannot be taken as a sign that the defendant has something to hide.\nFinal addresses\nAfter the defence completes its case, both the prosecution and the defence address \nthe jury . This stage can be quite crucial, particularly in longer trials in which the jury may have forgotten or overlooked evidence presented earlier. Counsel summarise the evidence presented, drawing attention to the strengths of their arguments and highlighting the weaknesses in the other side\u2019s argument.The prosecution presents \na summary of the case.\nThe defence presents a response to the prosecution.\nThe judge addresses the jury on issues relating to the trial.\nThe prosecution calls/uni00A0witnesses.\nThe defence calls witnesses. The accused has the right to remain/uni00A0silent.\nThe defence and the prosecution sum up their/uni00A0case. 94 Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 103": "Judge\u2019s charge to the jury\nThe judge instructs the jury on the relevant points of law . This is referred to as the judge\u2019s \ncharge to the jury . The judge will advise the jury that the onus is on the Crown to prove \n\u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 that the accused is guilty of the offences.\nVerdict\nThe jury then retires to the jury room to consider its verdict. When a jury cannot reach \na unanimous verdict after 6 hours, a majority verdict may be accepted in some cases. A\u00a0majority verdict is\u00a0defi  ned as the verdict of 11 out of 12 jurors.\nIn theory , the jury is given 6 hours to reach a decision, but this may be extended if the \njury feels it can reach a verdict given more time. However, the judge may ultimately , on the advice of the jury foreperson, declare the jury a hung jury \u2013 a jury unable to reach a verdict. In this case the jury is discharged and a new trial is ordered.\nObviously , this represents a great deal of time and considerable expense to the \nparties and the community . Consequently , it is preferable to extend the jury\u2019s time limit, particularly if an agreement is likely . Even if it appears that the jury is at loggerheads, the judge may return the jury to the jury room to reconsider the matter. When the jury reaches a verdict, the jury foreperson informs the court of the verdict. Being found not guilty means being acquitted. When there is a guilty verdict, the judge will pass sentence.\n3.9   Justice in the criminal \njustice\u00a0system\nThe purpose of law is to achieve justice. Chapter 1 discussed the concept of justice and \naddressed the diffi  culties in defi  ning it. Whether justice has been achieved is dependent on the values of the community at the time, the particular circumstances relating to a case and the individual who has been affected and how they have been affected. One thing that is clear is that the concept of justice involves being genuinely respectful towards all\u00a0people.\nA legal system can only operate if it has the support of the majority and the community \nwill only support the legal system if justice is provided.\nIt is diffi  cult for the legal system to meet all the expectations of the parties involved in a \ncriminal case \u2013 the accused and the victim.\nThe common elements of justice are fairness, equality and access to the legal system.\nFairness\nEveryone has the right to a lawful hearing and procedural fairness or impartiality . This means decision-making that is objective and reasonable by the person exercising administrative power: the magistrate or judge. They must also be independent, having no\u00a0constraints or bias in their decision-making.\nThe criminal pre-trial processes aim to provide individuals with a fair hearing. \nIndividuals have the right to remain silent. This recognises that all individuals have the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty . This also protects individuals against self-incrimination.\nCriminal processes and procedures re\ufb02  ect our basic values. These include the principle \nthat we are entitled to a fair treatment in a criminal matter. These values are re\ufb02  ected in:\n\u2022 the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty: the burden of proof is on the \naccuser to prove the guilty of the accused \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019\n\u2022 the right to silence: there are many reasons for reticence \u2013 fear of the police, lack \nof understanding of the legal system, of what is being asked, lack of confi  dence in expressing oneself. Guilt cannot be assumed if a person chooses not to speak in\u00a0court.\n\u2022 the right to trial by jury: a cross-section of the community means a range of values, \nmaking sure the law remains relevant and meaningful.The judge instructs the \njury on the relevant law.\nThe jury reaches a verdict. A majority verdict can be accepted after 6 hours except in murder, serious drug offences and Commonwealth offences, where a unanimous verdict is required.\nAfter the verdict is \nreached the judge sentences the offender. The judge can take into account a range of factors, including the impact of the crime on the victim.\nCriminal trials provide for a fair hearing, with an independent and impartial/uni00A0magistrate or judge and jury.\nThe presumption of innocence, the right to silence and the right to trial by jury are principles that aim to provide for a fair trial and to ensure that we are all treated equally.

  "Page 104": "A person accused of a criminal offence has their case heard before an independent \nand impartial body . The rules of evidence and procedure used in a trial ensure that the prosecution and the defence have an equal opportunity to present their case. The use of\u00a0the jury means that the fi  nal decision is made by unbiased and impartial representatives of the community .\nDo all people receive a fair hearing? A number of factors may affect the fair and equal \ntreatment of minority groups. These problems are discussed in more detail in Legal brief\u00a03.5 Access to justice and cultural differences.\nEquality\nThe criminal justice system strives to achieve non-discriminatory outcomes and \nto protect\u00a0all who come before it. Everyone should be treated the same, enjoying equal rights and opportunities throughout the legal system. The aim is that no person is\u00a0disadvantaged.\nWealth and power can cause differences in equality in Australia but the criminal \njustice system tries to balance that out with services available to the accused, pre-trial procedures to determine if enough evidence is actually available to commit the person to\u00a0a higher court, and trial procedures that require the same processes and procedures for both parties. Equal treatment is re\ufb02  ected in:\n\u2022 the use of interpreters for people with language diffi  culties\n\u2022 specialist courts, such as the Koori Court, that recognise cultural differences and \ntheir importance\n\u2022 evidence being given orally in court so that it can be tested through cross-\nexamination.\nHowever, are all people treated equally?\nAccess to legal resources\nA criminal justice system must be accessible to all members of society for it to be \nconsidered fair and just. Everyone has the right to defend themselves and receive justice, whether they are the accused or the victim. However, a person without effective legal representation could be considered unlikely to receive a fair trial.\nCultural diversity and justice\nThe laws in our criminal justice system re\ufb02  ect the values and culture of a mainly white \nAnglo-Saxon society , whereas Australia is made up of many different cultures. These fundamental differences, if not recognised in our community and addressed where necessary , can create injustices in our criminal law system. Two particular groups are at risk: Indigenous people and migrants.\nIndigenous Australians\nOur legal system is based on oral evidence in the courtroom. Where an accused or witness is unable to speak or understand English, an interpreter is provided. However, currently in Australia there are approximately 200 different Indigenous languages \u2013 a number are becoming extinct (there were estimated to be 250 at the time of colonisation). For people needing an interpreter, and it\u2019s usually older Indigenous people, the interpreter may have to be a family member or friend of the accused. This may not be easy in itself, bearing in mind Indigenous people\u2019s complex kinship rules.\nThere are differences in pronunciation and grammar in \u2018Aboriginal English\u2019, a \nrecognised form of English. Sometimes this form of language is seen as a pidgin English and the speaker is seen as less educated. This can be a diffi  culty when an accused Indigenous person is being tried by a jury . Courts have started to recognise Aboriginal English, but many injustices have occurred through a lack of awareness.Equality is re/f_l  ected \nthrough non-discriminatory processes and procedures that treat everyone in the criminal justice system the same way.\nCultural diversity can cause injustice in our legal/uni00A0system. 96 Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 105": "Further cultural differences that have caused injustices in the legal system include:\n\u2022 the way direct questioning is done with Indigenous witnesses or accused persons\u2022 the fact that it is seen as disrespectful to have or maintain direct eye contact with a \n\u2018respected\u2019 Indigenous person\n\u2022 the fact that it is not acceptable in Indigenous cultures to disagree with a \u2018respected\u2019 \nIndigenous person\n\u2022 the fact that it is not acceptable for a woman to discuss matters of a sexual nature, \nparticularly with a man (many police and legal personnel are men).\nImmigrants and refugees\nOne in four Australians were born overseas.

On 6 September 2007, following a committal hearing, Mills was committed to stand trial.\nOn 28 July 2008 the trial started, but it was stopped \nafter the informant revealed in evidence that /f_i  ngerprints on the bags containing the drugs had been tested \u2013 the defence had been told that it had not. Evidence was given that although /f_i  ngerprint analysis had been undertaken it revealed no useful information. That was highly relevant to Mills\u2019s defence, which was that the bags were left by someone else. DNA analysis had been requested but it had not been conducted.\nA pre-arraignment conference was scheduled for \n30/uni00A0June 2009, but it was twice adjourned (because of counsel and witness unavailability), and when the matter returned on 11 August 2009, counsel for Mills indicated that representations were being made to the DPP regarding a permanent stay of proceedings because of delays. Consideration of that issue led to further adjournments.On 29 October 2009, the next case conference was \nheld and the matter was set down for trial on 7 March 2011. The stay application was foreshadowed and a timetable was set. On 14 April 2010 the prosecution informed Mills\u2019s solicitors that no DNA analysis of the seized drug packaging would be conducted. No reason was given. On 15 April 2010, the pre-trial application was/uni00A0part-heard but then not relisted until 18 February 2011, apparently because of a death in the family of counsel for the prosecution. On 7 March 2011, some four years after Mills was charged, the rest of the application was heard.\nThe matter was taken to the ACT Supreme Court. \nChief Justice Terrence Higgins found that for a matter to take 4 years to come to trial after the decision to prosecute was unreasonable. He said: \u2018The delay of two and a half years from the /f_i  rst trial, in a relatively simple case is \u2026 egregiously unreasonable, for whatever reason it might happen.\u2019 Judge Higgins granted a permanent stay, believing it was the only appropriate response \u2013 the alternatives, an award of costs, relaxed bail conditions or credit for time served, were not. 100  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 109": "  Legal brief 3.4\nDelays and justice\nThe criminal justice system includes processes for the investigation, adjudication and \nsanctioning of criminal offences. These processes aim to provide fair and equal treatment of those accused or convicted of an offence. The accused is protected by the principles of a fair trial and guilt must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. Delays limit the capacity of the criminal justice system to achieve these aims.\nThere is no one measure of what is a reasonable time for the resolution of a criminal \nmatter. Time must be allowed for an allegation to be fully investigated and for a court to hear all the relevant evidence; however, it is also important that criminal cases should not be unduly delayed.\nWhy are delays a problem?\nThere are a number of consequences of delays in the criminal justice system. Delays may result in unnecessary hardship for victims and their families. Witnesses may have dif/f_i  culty remembering details. A person accused of a crime may be denied their liberty and held on remand. Delays undermine public con/f_i  dence in the ability of the criminal justice system and send the wrong message to offenders in the community. Delays also undermine the morale of those in the community who are responsible for enforcing the criminal/uni00A0law.\nDelays also contribute to the costs of the criminal justice system. Delays increase the \ncost of court administration. Delays also have cost implications for witnesses and victims. Contested cases are generally very time-consuming, especially in the higher courts, where a jury must be empanelled. For participants engaged in the hearing of a contested case, this can result in additional pressure.\nWhat causes delays?\nThe processes and procedures for hearing criminal cases are complex. Delays can occur in the investigation of an offence, in the pre-trial stages or during a trial. Some of the reasons for delays follow.\nDelays in \ndetermining a/uni00A0pleaIn most cases the defendant pleads guilty and the case is not contested. However, \neven uncontested cases can result in delays. These delays can be due to a late plea negotiation between the defence and the prosecution.\nDelays in the \npreparation of/uni00A0casesDelays can occur in the delivery of a brief, and the preparation, disclosure and /f_i  ling \nprocesses. These are compounded by defence dif/f_i  culties and the unavailability of legal aid.\nCourt \nworkloadsDelays are a by-product of the increased workload due to:\n \u00b7the increased number of cases heard by the courts\n \u00b7the average length of criminal cases\n \u00b7the number of court appearances needed to resolve a matter.\nDelays in collecting evidenceThe prosecution of complex cases relies on quality evidence resulting from police \ninvestigation. Such investigations typically require costly and time-consuming research and expertise.\nAdjournments A case may be adjourned because the courts have over-listed the number of cases that can be heard, or due to limited court facilities \u2013 such as access to videoconferencing facilities \u2013 or because a witness is not available on the day of the trial.\nRules of \nevidenceThe rules of evidence and the reliance on oral evidence contribute to delays in the \ncriminal justice system.Delays can cause \nsigni/f_i  cant hardship and undermine public con/f_i  dence in the legal/uni00A0system.

Criminal \nTrial Delays in \nAustralia: Trial Listing Outcomes is available at http://aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/rpp/61-80/rpp74.html.\nHow can we reduce delays?\nA number of processes in the criminal justice system aim to reduce delays. These include \nthe following.\nPlea \nnegotiationsBy the defence counsel and prosecution negotiating which charges are likely to succeed \nand not proceeding with those that are weak, the pre-trial and trial procedures are more ef/f_i  cient, with time not wasted on those charges not likely to be/uni00A0proven.\nPlea negotiations allow criminal procedures to move straight from pre-trial to the \nsentencing hearing, avoiding the need for a trial, thus saving time, money and stress for witnesses.\nSentence \ndiscountsThe practice of giving sentencing discounts for guilty pleas reduces the number of \ncontested cases. This practice allows the accused, as advised by legal counsel, to plead guilty on the presumption that they will receive a more favourable sentence. There is, however, a serious problem with this idea: the basic principle of our criminal justice system is that the defendant has the right to decide whether they should plead guilty or not guilty. We are all presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. If a defendant has exercised their right to plead not guilty, should they be treated more harshly than if they had pleaded guilty?\nSentence \nindicationThe defendant can ask the court to provide an indication of the sentence likely to be \nimposed if they plead guilty. A sentence indication procedure will help the defendant weigh up their options and should lead to earlier resolution of matters, which would reduce delays in hearing cases. 102  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 111": "A number of changes have been recommended to address delays. These include the \nfollowing.\nAbolish \ncommittal hearingsIt has been suggested that committal hearings should be abolished. Most committal \nhearings proceed as a hand-up brief. Some people have argued that the committal process avoids delays, as it clari/f_i  es issues and helps the defendant in deciding whether or not to plead guilty. Critics argue that the process rarely discharges a defendant at the committal stage, but has encouraged guilty pleas through the identi/f_i  cation of the key evidence against the accused. A possible /f_l  aw in the committal system is that the DPP has the statutory right to commit a person to trial regardless of a magistrate\u2019s decision.\nChange \ncourt work practices \u00b7Magistrates\u2019 Court cases to be listed by the hour\n \u00b7Custody centres to be built next to courts\n \u00b7Time limits to be set for the determination of applications for legal aid\n \u00b7Use of split sittings to extend court hours \u2013 a court could be used by one judge in \nthe morning (from 9am to 1.15pm) and by another judge in an afternoon sitting (from/uni00A01.30pm to 5.45pm)\n \u00b7Introduction of night court sittings and the extension of weekend courts beyond bail and remand.\nIt should be noted that it would require more magistrates and court staff to make this system work.

  "Page 112": "  Legal brief 3.5\nAccess to justice and cultural differences\nThe law does not recognise any difference between a recent migrant or refugee and a \nnative-born Australian. However, differences do exist. These may result from differences in cultural background, language skills and expectations of the criminal justice system. These factors may limit the capacity of the criminal justice system to provide for fair and equal treatment.\nPerceptions \nof/uni00A0policeImmigrants and refugees come to Australia with a range of attitudes and \nexpectations. Some may feel frightened and intimidated by police. They may come from a country in which police had the power to detain and torture a person without trial. Or they may expect that, as happens in some southern European countries, the police can be called to adjudicate in marital disputes or neighbourhood arguments. They may not understand why the police in Australia will not act in this capacity.\nUse of interpreters Many Australians are confused about their rights when questioned by the police. The problem is compounded for a person who does not speak, read or understand English very well. In Victoria, any person whose knowledge of the English language is insuf/f_i  cient to understand the questioning has the right to an interpreter. The police must arrange for one to be made available, and no questions can be asked until the interpreter is present. However, in practice, the need for an interpreter is determined by the police.\nThe need for interpreters when police question a suspect with limited \nEnglish has been recognised, in part, by the courts. Australian cases suggest that police statements taken without an interpreter may be inadmissible. The admission of such evidence is at the discretion of the judge. The judge can refuse to admit confessions if the warning and/or the questions were not interpreted for the suspect. The judge will not allow this evidence if its admission would be unfair.\nUnderstanding \nof/uni00A0bailNot all countries have a system of bail. Bail may be granted on the condition \nthat a sum of money is posted (that is, lodged) as a guarantee that an accused will appear at the time of trial. The system of bail is used mainly in common law countries, so people from other countries may not be familiar with the concept.\nEven if they do have an understanding of what is meant by bail, not all \npeople will have the resources to ful/f_i  l the bail requirements. Migrant and refugee communities have a large proportion of single people and working-class family groups. In many cases, they have neither the ready money to cover bail nor the ability to /f_i  nd a suitable guarantor.\nMoreover, in many countries the police have the power to impose on-the-\nspot /f_i  nes. A person who is not familiar with the concept of bail might confuse the lodging of bail with the payment of a /f_i  ne. They might think the payment at the police station is the payment of a /f_i  ne and that nothing more will be done, not realising that they are expected to appear in court.\nUnderstanding of \ncourt processesThe Magistrates\u2019 Court is the busiest court in the court hierarchy. If you are \ngoing to appear in court, you are most likely to appear in a Magistrates\u2019 Court. You might appear as either a defendant or a witness. Either way, if you are a new arrival, or otherwise unfamiliar with legal procedures in Australia, there is a lot going on in a Magistrates\u2019 Court that will confuse you.\n An individual who feels \nthat they have not been treated fairly can appeal to/uni00A0a higher court. 104  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

Our trial system may be unfamiliar. They may have a distrust of police and the court system.\nThe reasons for this are likely to be many \nand varied. Possible causes could be past experiences with corrupt police in their home/uni00A0country. Some may come from countries where police are used to quell criticism of the government and arbitrarily detain citizens.\nThe key to overcoming these issues is \nto build relationships with people in these communities. Crucial to this is building an understanding of rights, obligations and responsibilities.\nBuilding trust\nThe Department of Immigration has implemented a program entitled \u2018Taking the Initiative\u2019 . In this program police show new arrivals the principles of police work, and how it is planned and implemented. New arrivals can see that police in Australia are highly accountable and aim to serve the community.\nPolice also have access to information \nabout di\ufb00  erent cultures. This information helps the police develop education programs for their workforce.Victoria Police has implemented a range of \nprograms to establish and build relationships with people from di\ufb00  erent groups in the community.\nIt o\ufb00  ers recruitment packages in a range \nof languages, because it aims to recruit a workforce that is broadly representative of the community.

Through meetings and discussions with these community groups Victoria Police aims to build respect and mutual understanding.\nThe Victoria Police Multicultural Liaison \nUnit has been established to build relationships within the community.

The Neighbourhood Justice Centre (NJC) has created Aboriginal Hearing Days. This special list was established to provide better support for Indigenous people and to increase the rate of court attendance.

We look at the types of sanctions the courts may apply and discuss their ability to achieve the purposes of sentencing. We study the factors considered by courts when sentencing. Also considered are the factors which impact on the delivery of justice in sentencing: access to fair and equal treatment in the sentencing process. Lastly, we study recent reforms and consider recommendations to enhance the ability of the criminal justice system to promote the principles of justice during the sentencing\u00a0process.\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

  "Page 122": "4.1 The Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic)\nThe Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic) is the key legislation guiding sentencing in Victoria. \nIt\u00a0sets\u00a0out:\n\u2022 the purpose of sentencing\n\u2022 the hierarchy of sentencing options (organised from least severe to most severe)\u2022 the factors a court considers when sentencing.\nIt offers a range of sanctions, including fi  nes, Community Correction Orders (CCOs) \nand imprisonment.\nCRIMES ACT 1958  (VIC)\nIn addition to the Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic), other important legislation guiding \nsentencing includes the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic), which identifi  es the most serious offences (indictable offences) and states the maximum terms of imprisonment. The Summary Offences Act 1966 (Vic) sets out summary offences (less serious offences). Drug-related offences and their maximum penalties are identifi  ed in the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Act 1981 (Vic) and driving offences are set out in the Road Safety Act 1986 (Vic).\nCrimes Act 1958 (Vic)\nSection 3 Punishment for murder\n(1) Notwithstanding any rule of law to the contrary, a person convicted of\nmurder is liable to\u2014\n(a) level 1 imprisonment (life); or\n(b) imprisonment for such other term as is /f_i  xed by the court\u2014\nas the court determines.\n4.2   Purposes of criminal\u00a0sanctions\nThe Sentencing Act sets out the purposes or reasons for sanctions being imposed. \nThese\u00a0include:\n\u2022Just punishment: to in\ufb02  ict some kind of loss or burden on the offender in a manner\nthat is just, given the circumstances of the crime committed. The hierarchy ofsentencing options allow various degrees of loss to be imposed, ranging froma fi  nancial loss (fi  ne) to deprivation of liberty (imprisonment). The principle ofproportionality operates to guard against the imposition of an unduly lenient orharsh sentence. For example, a long prison sentence would be considered a \u2018justpunishment\u2019 for a serious crime such as murder. (The median sentence for murder\u2013 the sentence in the middle of all the sentences in length \u2013 is 20 years.)\n\u2022Deterrence: there are two types of deterrence: general (public) and specifi  c.General deterrence is aimed at preventing crime in the general population forfear of the perceived consequences. The punishment serves as an example tomembers of the public who might be tempted to commit crime. In contrast, specifi  cdeterrence is designed to deter the particular offender from reoffending. A personwho loses their licence for drink driving will hopefully be deterred from drivingunder the in\ufb02  uence again.\n\u2022Rehabilitation: to establish conditions that would alter or modify the behaviour ofoffenders so that they will abandon their wrongdoing and reintegrate into society aslaw-abiding citizens. Rehabilitation includes general education programs and drugdependency programs designed to address the underlying issues contributing tothe criminal behaviour.The Sentencing Act sets \nout a range of factors to be considered in determining a sanction.\n For information \nabout sentencing, visit the Sentencing Advisory Council at www.sentencingcouncil.vic.edu.au.\nThe purpose of a sanction is to provide for just punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation and community protection. For young offenders, rehabilitation is the principal consideration, as identi/f_i  ed in the Children, Youth and Families Act 2005 (Vic). 114  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 123": "\u2022 Denunciation: to condemn and criticise publicly the conduct of the offender \nas wrong and inexcusable. This is a fundamental purpose of criminal law and of sentencing, as it requires that a sentence should also communicate society\u2019s condemnation of the particular defendant\u2019s behaviour. The concept of denunciation is explained in R v MacDonald (unrep, 12/12/95, NSWCCA), where Gleeson CJ, Hunt\u00a0CJ at CL and Kirby P said:\nIn a case such as the present, it is important to bear in mind the denunciatory \nrole of sentencing. Manslaughter involves the felonious taking of human life. This may involve a wide variety of circumstances calling for a variety of penal consequences. Even so, unlawful homicide, whatever form it takes, has always been recognised by the law as a most serious crime. The protection of human life and personal safety is a primary objective of the system of criminal justice. The value of which the community places upon human life is re\ufb02  ected in its expectations of that system \u2026 Society was entitled to have the conduct of the respondent denounced at least in that fashion.\n\u2022 Community protection: sanctions should operate to protect the community \nagainst the potentially harmful actions of individuals: removing an offender from the community , for example, extinguishes the threat of harm to others. However, the principle of proportionality ensures that a sentence should not extend beyond what is appropriate to the crime merely to protect society . Imprisonment (removing an individual from the community) is seen as a last resort.\nAims of sanctionsJust punishment\nDeterrence\nRehabilitation DenunciationCommunity\nprotection\n4.3   Factors considered \nin\u00a0sentencing\nIf an offender pleads guilty or is found guilty , the judge will hold a sentencing hearing. \nThe sentencing hearing is part of the post-trial process and is where the offender is given a sentence by the judge. The sanction may include a fi  ne, or a Community Correction Order (CCO), or imprisonment. Maximum penalties are legislated by parliament and are used by the courts as a reference point when sentencing. The\u00a0courts consider a number of factors, including the impact of the crime on the victim.\nThe court has already heard evidence during the trial stage, including:\n\u2022 The nature and circumstances of the offence: the way crimes are committed \nvaries enormously . Some crimes are planned, while others are spur of the moment. Some cause a great harm, others very little.\n\u2022 The degree of criminality: the extent of misconduct relates to the number of offences and their seriousness.\n\u2022 Injury, loss or damage: the extent and degree of injury or loss will affect the sentence.

  "Page 124": "The sentence hearing process allows for additional information to be presented to \ndetermine the most appropriate sentence. This includes the following.\nMitigating factors\nMitigating factors are evidence about the offender or the circumstances of the crime which may reduce the sentence, such as:\n\u2022 The offender was an accessory to the crime (helped the main offender) but not the \nmain actor.\n\u2022 The offender showed remorse for the crime.\n\u2022 No one was hurt or likely to be hurt during the crime.\u2022 The offender had minor or no criminal history .\u2022 The offender pleaded guilty and co-operated with police.\nAggravating factors\nAggravating factors are evidence about the offender or the circumstances of the crime \nwhich may increase the sentence, such as:\n\u2022 The offender has a criminal record.\n\u2022 The nature of the crime was particularly cruel.\u2022 The offender used a weapon.\nGuilty pleas\nGuilty pleas or intentions to plead guilty must be taken into account when sentencing. \nThey are treated as mitigating factors and can result in a reduced sentence. A plea of guilty may be taken into account through either a specifi  ed sentence discount or a sentence indication. A guilty plea may be taken as a sign of remorse. In addition, a guilty plea can also save the community the considerable cost of conducting a full trial and reduce delays in our court system. An early guilty plea will also spare victims and witnesses the potential trauma of giving evidence.\nSpecifi  ed sentence discount\nThe specifi  ed sentence discount scheme allows a judge or magistrate to impose a less severe sentence when the offender pleads guilty . In 2008, an amendment to the Sentencing Act required courts to provide a \u2018specifi  ed sentence discount\u2019. The court will state what penalty would have been imposed (the overall sentence and the non-parole period) for the offence had the offender not pleaded guilty , and the fi  nal discounted sentence that recognises that the offender did plead guilty .\nA specifi  ed sentencing discount is \nused in adult courts and applies to:A specifi  ed sentencing discount in \nthe Children\u2019s Court applies to:\n \u00b7all custodial orders\n \u00b7/f_i  nes of 10 penalty units or more (or aggregated \n/f_i  nes of 20 penalty units or more). \u00b7youth attendance orders\n \u00b7youth residential centre orders\n \u00b7youth justice centre orders.\nThe specifi  ed sentencing discount provides an incentive for pleading guilty at an early \nstage of proceedings. This places defendants in a better position to make this decision early in the criminal proceedings.\nSPECIFIED SENTENCE \nDISCOUNT\nThe most common guilty plea discount (in 44.9% of cases) for imprisonment \nsentences was between 20% and 30% less than the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed. 116  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 125": "Sentence indication\nSentence indication is a process that permits a magistrate or judge to give a defendant \na general indication of the sentence that would be likely to be imposed if the defendant pleaded guilty before a hearing or trial.\nSentence indications are used in the Victorian Supreme, County and Magistrates\u2019 \nCourts. In the Supreme and County Court the accused can apply for a sentence indication at any stage in the proceedings after the written charges are fi  led. The prosecutor must consent to the application and the judge must agree to it as well. The judge will then be given a summary of the facts agreed to by both the prosecution and the defence, and other relevant information. Based on this information the judge will indicate whether or not he or she is likely to impose a custodial sentence if the accused enters a guilty plea at that stage in the proceedings.\nIn the Magistrates\u2019 Court, a magistrate can indicate if he or she is likely to impose a \ncustodial sentence, or can indicate the type of sentence likely to be imposed. For instance, the magistrate may indicate that he or she would be likely to impose a Community Correction Order.

This helps courts understand the effect of the crime on the\u00a0victim.\nThe court must consider:\n\u2022 the impact of the offence on the victim\u2022 the personal circumstance of the victim\u2022 any injury , loss or damage resulting directly from the offence.\nThe Victim Impact Statement is a statutory declaration that may be read or presented to \nthe court. It may include photos, drawings, poems and other material related to the impact on the victim.\nVICTIMS CHARTER\nThe Victims\u2019 Charter Act 2006 (Vic) identifi  es key principles for the treatment of \nvictims of crime when dealing with criminal justice agencies, including the right to\u00a0prepare a Victim Impact Statement.\nThe victim of a violent crime committed by an adult offender may ask to be \nplaced on the Victims\u2019 Register: this allows them to be informed of the offender\u2019s parole or release.\nNEWSREPORT  4.1\nA powerful voice\nUS VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN HIGHLIGHTED TO THE  \nworld the power of Victim Impact Statements when he read a 7000-word one to a court: it was a letter written by a Stanford University rape survivor.\nVictoria introduced Victim Impact Statement legislation \nin 1994, providing victims with the chance to tell courts how a crime a\ufb00  ected them. Later the Sentencing/uni00A0Act was amended, requiring the court, when sentencing, to take into account not only the personal circumstances of the victim and any injury, loss or damage/uni00A0resulting from of the o\ufb00  ence, but also the impact/uni00A0of crime on victims.\nThe Victims Support Agency (VSA) prepared A Victim\u2019s \nVoice \u2013 Victim Impact Statements in Victoria, looking at VIS legislation in the State. It found that:\n\u2022 Not all victims realise they have a choice about \nwhether or not to make a statement.\n\u2022 Victims usually have a very limited understanding \nof/uni00A0the criminal justice system and court processes.\n\u2022 The way information is delivered is important.\u2022 Providing information to victims sometimes \nincludes/uni00A0\u2018expectation management\u2019 .\nThe VSA believed that the government should direct the VSA and the Department of Justice to assess the e\ufb00  ectiveness of Victim Impact Statements, determining whether they:\n\u2022 are the appropriate tool to inform the court about \nthe impact of the crimes\n\u2022 assist the court in determining sentence\u2022 increase victims\u2019 levels of satisfaction and \nparticipation in the criminal justice system.\nThe VSA consulted with police, prosecutors, defence counsel, judges and magistrates, victims\u2019 service agencies, witness assistance services and victims. This research found that:\n\u2022 two-thirds of judges and magistrates felt that Victim \nImpact Statements were often or occasionally of help in determining a sentence. The same percentage felt that the statements could contain additional information relevant to sentencing.\n\u2022 Victim Impact Statements could be therapeutic and \nhave a restorative element. For instance, in the trial of serial killer Paul Dupas, he could not be sentenced to further time in jail, but Justice Cummins viewed the use of the Victim Impact Statement in the trial as a vindication of the rights of all victims of crime.\nDespite the power of the US university student\u2019s letter, some lawyers believe that Victim Impact Statements have several problems:\n\u2022 the victim has to relive the event\u2022 courts need to be careful not to allow the views of \nvictims to disproportionately in/f_l  uence sentences. 118  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

  "Page 128": "NEWSREPORT  4.2 \nVictoria\u2019s prison population up, fuelled by increasing use of remand\nVICTORIA\u2019S PRISON POPULATION HAS GROWN/uni00A0BY  67% \nover the past decade (from 3908 prisoners to 6520), \nlargely due to an increase in the number of people refused bail (particularly for violent o\ufb00  ences), a new report from the Sentencing Advisory Council reveals.\nReleased today, the report, Victoria\u2019s Prison Population \n2005 to 2016, analyses both published and previously unpublished data to map trends in imprisonment in/uni00A0Victoria.\nThe report reveals that the 67% increase in the adult \nprison population was unevenly spread across di\ufb00  erent groups of prisoners. For example, over the survey period, there was:\n\u2022 a 154% increase in the number of unsentenced \nprisoners (those being held on remand awaiting trial or sentencing) compared with a 46% increase for sentenced prisoners;\n\u2022 a 147% increase in the number of Aboriginal and \nTorres Strait Islander prisoners (compared with a 62% increase for non-Indigenous prisoners); and\n\u2022 a 75% increase in the number of female prisoners \n(compared with a 66% increase for males).\nThe percentage of all sentenced o\ufb00  enders sent to prison has remained fairly steady over the survey period, but the/uni00A0average length of prison sentences has been decreasing for some o\ufb00  ence types since 2010\u201311. This is largely due to an increase in the use of sentences combining prison with a community correction order (CCO). For example, 38% of the sentences of imprisonment imposed in the Magistrates\u2019 Court for drug o\ufb00  ences in 2014\u201315 also required the o\ufb00  ender to comply with a CCO upon release.\nThe use of shorter prison terms, especially sentences \ncombining prison with a CCO, has led to a decline in the number of sentenced prisoners since 2014 (from 4973 in 2014 to 4637 in 2016). However, this small decrease has been more than made up for by the increase in unsentenced prisoners.\nSince 2014, the sentenced prisoner population has \ndecreased by 7%, while the unsentenced prisoner population has increased by 65%. The increase in unsentenced prisoners was a result of more people being held on remand, rather than an increase in the average length of time spent on remand. The unsentenced prisoner population grew from 19% of the total prison population on 30 June 2006 to 29% on 30 June 2016, meaning that close to one in three prisoners has not been sentenced for the charges for which they are in prison.\nBoth the number of detected o\ufb00  ences and the \nrate of detected o\ufb00  ending/uni00A0as a proportion of the total population have increased since 2010\u201311, after having been relatively stable since 2004\u201305. These increases have been the result of an increase in \u2018unique alleged o\ufb00  enders\u2019 apprehended for o\ufb00  ences against the person, such as cause injury/uni00A0o\ufb00  ences.\nOther key /f_i  ndings of the report\nCombined orders (prison plus a CCO) have increased as a proportion of all prison sentences imposed by all courts, particularly for violent o\ufb00  enders. This means that an increasing proportion of prisoners continue to be supervised in the community after they are released from/uni00A0prison.\nThere have been changes to the balance of o\ufb00  ence \ntypes for people in prison. For example, in 2004\u201305, property o\ufb00  ences were the most common o\ufb00  ence type attracting a prison sentence. In 2014\u201315, more o\ufb00  enders were sent to prison for o\ufb00  ences against the person than for any other o\ufb00  ence type.\nSentencing Advisory Council Chair, Emeritus Professor \nArie Freiberg said:\nThis report shows that changes to detected crime, \nas well as changes to bail and sentencing practices, are having an e\ufb00  ect on both the size and the composition of Victoria\u2019s prison/uni00A0population.\nThere has been an increase in the prison \npopulation caused by an increase in detected crime, especially crimes against the person, including family violence. The overall percentage of all people sentenced who receive a prison sentence has stayed more or less the same over the past 10 years. However, more people are now being sentenced, and so more people are going to/uni00A0prison.\nWhat\u2019s new is that an increase in the number \nof relatively short prison terms, including terms combined with a CCO, has led to a decrease in the sentenced prisoner population. But this decrease has been more than made up for by the increase in prisoners held on/uni00A0remand.\nSentencing Council Media release, 3 November 2016\n 120  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 129": "4.4  Types of sanctions\nThe Sentencing Act sets out a hierarchy of sanctions. The courts are required to \nconsider less severe sanctions, such as adjournments or fi  nes, before imposing harsher \nsanctions, such as imprisonment. The provisions of the Act apply to all courts except the Children\u2019s\u00a0Court.\nSENTENCING CHILDREN\nSentencing children requires a different approach due to their vulnerability and \nneed. Section 362(1) of the Children\u2019s Youth and Families Act 2015 (Vic) identifi  es rehabilitation and diversion from the criminal justice system as the primary purpose in sentencing children.\nMost serious Imprisonment\nDrug treatment orderCommunity Correction OrderFineAdjournment undertakingDismissal or discharge Least serious\nDismissal, discharge and adjournment\nWhere possible, the aim is to not record a conviction against the defendant \u2013 even if \nhe or she is found guilty of the offence. A criminal conviction of any kind can have a \nnumber of negative effects on an offender. Its immediate effects can include a licence cancellation, and/or fi  nancial loss due to a fi  ne. It may also have indirect and long-lasting consequences. For example, applications for insurance, loans and jobs may be less likely to succeed, and may even be denied, on the grounds that the person has a criminal\u00a0record.\nA court will therefore consider the following factors in relation to whether or not to \nimpose a recorded conviction:\n\u2022 the nature of the offence committed\n\u2022 the character and record of the offender\u2022 the impact of the conviction on the offender\u2019s employment, social and economic \nwellbeing.\nDismissal\nA dismissal is an order by which the court fi  nds an offender guilty of an offence but does \nnot record a conviction or impose a sanction.There is a hierarchy of \nsanctions  \u2013 imprisonment is considered the last resort.\nDismissal, discharge and adjournments give courts the discretion to not record a conviction and/or not impose a sanction.

  "Page 130": "Discharge\nA discharge is when the court fi  nds an offender guilty of an offence and records a \nconviction but does not impose a sanction.\nAdjournment\nAn adjournment which allows a person to be released into the community can be made with or without recording a conviction.\nAdjournment without conviction\nAn adjournment without conviction is an order by which a court fi  nds a defendant guilty of an offence, adjourns the hearing for up to 60 months and releases the defendant. An adjournment without conviction usually requires the defendant to agree to \u2018be of good behaviour\u2019. Providing that the offender is of good behaviour for the period of the adjournment, no conviction is recorded. The adjournment may also specify that the defendant comply with special conditions imposed by the court. This is now a common order imposed by the Magistrates\u2019 Court for minor offences.\nAdjournment with conviction\nA court can convict an offender for an offence and adjourn the case for up to 60 months. The offender is released after giving the court an undertaking to \u2018be of good behaviour\u2019 for the period of the adjournment. The court may also impose special conditions during this\u00a0period.\nFines\nFines are the most common sanctions imposed in Victoria and are used for summary and indictable offences. A court can impose a fi  ne with or without recording a conviction. In determining the amount of the fi  ne, the court must take into consideration, among other things, the fi  nancial circumstances of the offender. However, while the fi  nancial circumstances are important, they are not the only consideration in determining the amount of the fi  ne.\nUsually an Act sets a maximum fi  ne for a particular offence, measured in penalty units, \nwhich have a monetary equivalent. For example, under section 46(2) of the Road Safety Act 1986 (Vic), \u2018a person who fails to stop the vehicle when so requested or signalled is guilty of an offence. Penalty: 8 penalty units\u2019.A /f_i  ne is a monetary \npenalty for an offence.THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE DIVERSION  \nPROGRAM (CJDP)\nThe CJDP is governed by section 59 of the \nCriminal Procedures Act 2009 (Vic). It operates in all Magistrates\u2019 Courts, and provides a diversion program for those convicted for the fi  rst time and those convicted of minor offences. The program allows offenders to avoid a criminal record by accepting conditions. The conditions aim to benefi  t the offender, the victim and the community as a whole. For instance, offenders facing charges for minor driving offences could be ordered to attend a driver safety course rather than receive a bond or fi  ne. Also, an offender may be required to make full reparation to their victim (pay back whatever the costs of the offence to the victim were) and to send a letter of apology . The program draws upon community resources for appropriate counselling or treatment, and helps local community projects by providing voluntary work and donations (from the offenders).

CCOs come with a range of new conditions, and a CCO can be imposed for a period up to the maximum penalty for an o\ufb00  ence in the County and Supreme Courts.\nThe Director of Public Prosecutions applied to the Court of Appeal in 2013 \nfor a guideline judgment in relation to two cases in which the o\ufb00  ender had applied for leave to appeal against the sentence: R v Clements (S/uni00A0APCR 2013 0141) and R/uni00A0v/uni00A0Boulton (S APCR 2013 0135).

In the higher courts, a CCO can be imposed for up to the statutory maximum term of imprisonment for that offence. For example, for the offence of theft the maximum length of a CCO could be up to 10 years \u2013 the same as the maximum term of imprisonment available for that\u00a0offence.\nConditions on CCOs\nAll those sentenced to a CCO must abide by basic conditions, such as not reoffending, \nnot leaving Victoria without permission and abiding by any order of the Secretary of the Department of Justice.\nEach CCO will also include at least one other \u2018optional\u2019 condition, chosen according to \nthe purposes of sentencing for that offender and that offence.

The court imposes a custodial sentence which is suspended while the offender undertakes a rehabilitation program that has been specifi  cally designed for the offender.\nThe offender is closely monitored. There are regular meetings with the magistrate and \ncounsellors. The offender also needs to consent to urine tests. Breaches of parts of the treatment order can result in short periods of imprisonment. If the offender continues to offend, the original custodial sentence can be imposed.\nImprisonment\nImprisonment removes an offender from the community and denies them their liberty . This is considered the most severe sanction. The Sentencing Act recognises it as a \nsentence of last resort, which means that judges must consider all other sentencing options before imposing a prison term. Prison is seen as a way to protect the community , as well as punish the offender and denounce the behaviour. Some would argue that imprisonment also acts as a deterrent. Programs offered within prison aim to provide for the rehabilitation of offenders.A drug treatment \norder (DTO) allows a custodial sentence to be suspended to allow the offender to undertake a rehabilitation/uni00A0program.\nImprisonment means that a person is detained by the State and denied their/uni00A0liberty. 128  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

While Acts of Parliament specify \nthe maximum sentence for all offences punishable by imprisonment, they rarely \nspecify a minimum term. This allows the courts some discretion to determine lengths of imprisonment. A minimum term of imprisonment is the time that a prisoner must serve before they can apply for parole. In all cases courts are guided by the principle of parsimony , meaning that they must not impose a greater sentence than is necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing.

A cumulative sentence means that all terms of imprisonment are added together to form a total period of imprisonment.\nSerious \noffendersA serious offender includes an offender who has repeatedly committed an arson, serious \ndrug or sexual offence. When sentencing a serious offender, the court will consider the protection of the community from the offender as the principal purpose for which the sentence is imposed. To achieve that purpose, the court may impose a longer sentence.\nSerious sex \noffendersSerious sex offenders must serve multiple jail terms (consecutively), except in exceptional \ncircumstances. A serious sex offender is de/f_i  ned as anyone sentenced to jail for two or more sex offences.\nInde/f_i  nite \ndetentionsInde/f_i  nite jail sentences can be imposed for offences such as murder, manslaughter and \nsex offences. The offender serves their nominal sentence, after which their sentence is reviewed by a judge. If the judge decides at that stage that the offender is still a danger to the community, the offender will be returned to jail for another 3 years. After this time has elapsed, the case is reviewed once more.\nDOES LIFE IMPRISONMENT \nMEAN LIFE ?\nIn Victoria, only the Supreme Court can impose a life sentence. A term of \u2018life\u2019 \nmeans for the term of an offender\u2019s natural life. However, the court must fi  x a non-parole period for any sentence of 2 years or more, unless it considers that the nature of the offence or the past history of the offender makes it inappropriate to fi  x a non-parole period. If a non-parole period is not set for a life sentence, the offender will remain in prison for their whole life.\nFor example, an offender may be sentenced to life imprisonment with a \nnon-parole period of 25 years. This means that the offender must serve a minimum term of 25 years before becoming eligible for parole. In this example, the Adult Parole Board may release the offender after 25 years or may decide against parole, in which case the offender returns to prison until the Adult Parole Board rules them eligible for parole or until the end of their sentence.\nWhat are inde/f_i  nite sentences?\nAn indefi  nite sentence can be imposed if a court believes that the offender is a serious danger to society .

  "Page 140": "Other court orders for criminal offences\nIn addition to sentencing, the courts can also make other orders. These include the following.\nCompensation orders\nCourts have the power to make a compensation order if the defendant has been \nconvicted of an offence and placed on a bond or CCO and another person has suffered loss or property damage as a result of the offence. If the victim applies for compensation, the court can order the defendant to compensate the victim for the loss, damage or destruction of property .\nRestitution orders\nCourts may order a defendant who has been found guilty of stealing goods or being in possession of stolen goods to return the goods to the owner. If the goods have been sold, the defendant may be ordered to pay compensation to the value of the goods stolen.\nHospital orders\nCourts can make a diagnosis, assessment and treatment order for a period of up to 3\u00a0months. These orders can be made once a defendant has been found guilty . However, if, in the court\u2019s opinion, the defendant is suffering from a mental illness that requires treatment and admission to a psychiatric in-patient service, the defendant can be admitted\u00a0as an involuntary patient.\nCancellation or suspension of licences or permits\nUnder the Road Safety Act, the courts and VicRoads have the power to suspend, cancel or\u00a0vary licences and permits issued under the Act.\nDrug offender cautioning scheme\nUnder this scheme, fi  rst-time offenders for possession of drugs are formally cautioned by\u00a0the police rather than being charged with an offence.\n4.5  Justice and sentencing\nSanctions aim to represent the values of the community . Sanctioning aims to provide just punishment, deterrence, denunciation and community protection. Although sanctions are supposed to represent the values of the community , the media sometimes report outrage at the sentences handed down by our courts. \nJustice in sentencing is a complex matter. Basic principles of justice imply that \nall offenders facing the criminal justice system will have access to fair and equitable treatment. While this means that like cases will be treated alike, the sentencing process allows different sentences to be imposed on offenders, to re\ufb02  ect their different circumstances and degrees of culpability . For example, an offender found guilty of premeditated murder may receive a harsher sentence than an offender who has committed a spur of the moment killing. Both sentences could be considered fair given the different circumstances. The Sentencing Act requirement that courts consider mitigating and aggravating factors promotes fair sentencing outcomes for all offenders.\nSanctioning options \naim to/uni00A0treat offenders fairly, with the sanctions re/f_l  ecting the seriousness of the offence. 132  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 141": "Sentencing guidelines set out in legislation guide courts when sentencing. They are \nfundamental to the effective operation of the criminal justice system, and ensure that \nsanctions are:\n\u2022 not unnecessarily severe to achieve the purpose for which the sanction is imposed. \nFor example, if a court can achieve the aim of the punishment with a fi  ne, the court must not impose a CCO to achieve that purpose. Similarly , if a CCO will achieve the purpose, the court must not impose a prison term.\n\u2022 proportional and measured in relation to the offending behaviour. For example, \nimposing 1 year\u2019s imprisonment for failure to pay a traffi  c fi  ne would be deemed excessive considering the lack of seriousness of the offence.\n\u2022 equitable and similar sanctions imposed on like offenders and in like \ncircumstances. Consistency , fairness and predictability in sentencing are essential if\u00a0the community is to have confi  dence in the criminal justice system.\n\u2022 just and appropriate in circumstances where an offender is sentenced for \nmultiple offences. The guidelines that indicate which sentences are to be served cumulatively and which are served concurrently ensure that sentences are not unnecessarily\u00a0harsh.\nTHE PRINCIPLES  THAT GUIDE \nSENTENCING\n \u00b7Parsimony: a court must not impose a sentence that is more severe than \nnecessary to achieve the purpose/s for which the sentence is imposed.\n \u00b7Proportionality: this ensures that the overall punishment must be proportional to\u00a0the gravity of the offending behaviour.\n \u00b7Parity: this promotes fairness for offenders by imposing similar sentences for comparable offences committed by offenders in similar circumstances.\n \u00b7Totality: this applies when a number of sentences are imposed and means adjusting the overall sentence to promote a just and appropriate outcome in light\u00a0of the overall offending behaviour.\nEqual and fair sentencing\nOur sentencing system is not perfect, and many social and cultural factors, as well as time \nand fi  nancial costs, affect the system\u2019s ability to deliver fair and equal treatment to all.\nFor a start, a range of factors affect the offender\u2019s ability to understand the sentencing \nprocess. These factors include education, housing, mental health and drug/alcohol dependence.\nThe 2015 Victorian Ombudsman\u2019s report, \u2018Investigation into the rehabilitation and \nreintegration of prisoners in Victoria\u2019, stated that:\n\u2022 only 14% of prisoners completed secondary school\n\u2022 75% of male and 83% of female prisoners have a history of substance abuse and \nthe average prisoner was unemployed at the time of offending\n\u2022 40% of prisoners suffer from mental illness and cognitive disabilities and were \nhomeless.\nTraditional sentencing options, particularly imprisonment, often fail to address the \nunderlying cause of the criminal behaviour. Given that 99% of prisoners in Victoria will be released at some point, there is a pressing need to address the offending behaviours and an equal need to prepare prisoners to re-enter society as law-abiding citizens. All this requires treatment and education while offenders are in prison and transition support when they are back in the community .Sentencing guidelines \npromote fair and equitable sentencing for all offenders.

  "Page 142": "Cultural diversity and sentencing\nInequality in sentencing outcomes may occur because of an offender\u2019s cultural \nbackground. Victoria has one of the most culturally diverse populations in Australia and yet the law does not make concessions for recently arrived migrants, Indigenous Australians or refugees.\nMinority groups may have diffi  culty understanding and effectively contributing \nto the sentencing process because of their cultural background, language barriers and different\u00a0expectations of the legal system. This can result in unfair and unjust sentencing\u00a0outcomes.\nINDIGENOUS  OFFENDERS\nThere has been a significant reduction in the rate of Aboriginal adults serving a \nCommunity Based Service (CBS) order since 2010\u201311, from 16 per 1000 to 11.8 per 1000 in 2015. However, Aboriginal Victorians continue to be overrepresented in justice supervision, at almost 12 times the rate of non-Aboriginal Victorians. In 2015, 261 Aboriginal young people (10\u201317 years) received a police caution, arrest or summons or other type of police processing. In Victoria, Aboriginal adults are 11 times more likely to be incarcerated than Victoria\u2019s non-Aboriginal population (nationally 13 times more likely).

The average prisoner has not completed high school, is most likely unemployed at the time of committing the crime and has a history of substance/uni00A0abuse.\n \u00b7Focus on rehabilitation of vulnerable groups within the prison population, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander prisoners, those with cognitive disability, and women and young offenders, and on reintegrating them into the community upon release (2015 Victorian Ombudsman investigation into rehabilitation and reintegration).\n \u00b7Engage family and community support agencies in pre- and post-release transition programs.\n \u00b7Ensure that CCOs are focused on reintegrating young people into the community by targeting programs linked to addressing the offending behaviour (the Church Network for Youth Justice submitted that the effectiveness of sentencing options as deterrence to reoffending depends on this).\n \u00b7Develop and provide community experiences that are meaningful to the young person, where they are treated with dignity, and can enter a trusting relationship with an adult. Conversely, \u2018meaningless work, [or] a dehumanising or violent experience will promote bitterness and militate against deterrence\u2019 (Australian Law Reform Commission, \u2018Principles of Sentencing\u2019).\n \u00b7Increase the number of Neighbourhood Justice Centres (NJCs) \u2013 currently, the City of Yarra has the only one in Australia. The primary focus of the centre is to address the underlying issues causing criminal behaviour. As such it brings together a multi-jurisdictional court, a broad team of support services and community support services. The NJC has successfully reduced crime and increased community safety, thus reducing costs in the criminal justice system. The Sentencing Advisory Commission endorsed this one stop shop approach, which brings together 20 independent agencies who work collaboratively to address the underlying causes of harmful behaviour.\n \u00b7Continue the expansion of the Koori Court \u2013 increase the number of locations for children\u2019s Koori Courts and broaden their use so that they can hear \u2018not guilty\u2019 pleas: this could further improve deterrence and promote alternative sentencing options before imprisonment for young Indigenous offenders.\n \u00b7Use circle sentencing to avoid Indigenous offenders going to jail \u2013 it operates successfully in Canada: a circle of people, mainly Elders, but also police and the magistrate, decide on a sentence which does not include a jail term. It is only used with offenders who have pleaded guilty. 138  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

  "Page 148": "WHAT IS THE SENTENCING \nADVISORY\u00a0COUNCIL ?\nThe Sentencing Advisory Council was established in \n1991 by the government to bridge the gap between the community , the government and the courts.\nIts jurisdiction is derived from Part 9A of the \nSentencing Act. It is an independent statutory body and its key function is to monitor, evaluate and provide feedback to policy-makers, legislators and the community on sentencing statistics and trends in\u00a0Victoria.\nThis information helps the government (executive) \nand parliament (legislative) develop effective sentencing law and implement it in the courts.\nThe Sentencing Advisory Council provides \ncommunity education, advises the Attorney-General, publishes reports, receives submissions from the public and liaises with courts on sentencing and criminal justice issues. The Sentencing Advisory Council thus plays a valuable role in promoting public confi  dence in sentencing. \nIts policy recommendations are generally \naccepted by government and adopted in legislation.\nWhile the public is not directly involved in the \nsentencing process, individuals can indirectly in\ufb02  uence sentencing policy by contacting their local MP or the Attorney-General and making their views known. There are also parliamentary law reform committees that review aspects of sentencing \u2013 they have public hearings and accept submissions from the public.\nEvaluating sentencing\nThe approach taken to determining an appropriate sanction has strengths, but aspects of \nthe sentencing process are the subject of ongoing community concern. The table below outlines the key strengths of the sentencing process and some of the issues faced by the\u00a0system.\nStrengths Problems\n \u00b7Sentencing legislation, made by parliament, re/f_l  ects community \nvalues. The legislation guides the courts when making sentencing orders.\n \u00b7Judges and magistrates retain discretion (in the majority of cases) when determining sentencing orders, meaning they can weigh up a number of individual factors to determine a fair outcome based on the nature of the offender and the severity of the offence.\n \u00b7Key sentencing principles (parsimony, proportionality, totality, parity) guide sentencing outcomes to ensure fairness for offenders by imposing similar sentences for comparable offences committed by offenders in similar circumstances.\n \u00b7The Victim Impact Statement enables magistrates and judges to consider the impact the crime has on the victim and their family, thus promoting a fair outcome for the victim, offender and the community. Similarly, the Victims\u2019 Charter promotes con/f_i  dence in/uni00A0the sentencing process by informing victims of the right to have a voice in the sentencing process.\n \u00b7The Sentencing Act allows for the Court of Appeal to provide guideline judgments to help courts with their sentencing practices, to promote fair and just outcomes for offenders, victims /uni00A0and the community.\n \u00b7The Sentencing Advisory Committee monitors and evaluates sentencing practices to promote fair and consistent sentencing. The committee provides expert advice and makes recommendations to the Attorney-General.\n \u00b7The appeal system exists to enable the Of/f_i  ce of Public Prosecutions to appeal any sentence they regard as inappropriate. Similarly, offenders may appeal any sentence they consider too lengthy. The appeal system provides a safeguard against inappropriate sentencing.\n \u00b7The vast majority of sentences are not subject to appeal. They are regarded as just, fair and appropriate and promote public con/f_i  dence in the criminal justice and sentencing systems.The sentencing process is not a perfect system:\n \u00b7Understanding criminal behaviour and how best to respond to it in a manner that is fair, just and equal to the offender, the victim and the community is an ongoing challenge for the criminal justice system.\n \u00b7There are concerns within the community regarding some aspects of sentencing: in particular, for sexual assaults such as rape, and for sexual offences against children.\n \u00b7Sentencing ranges are broad, and this sometimes creates inconsistency in sentencing and may cause the public to question the sentencing.\n \u00b7Vulnerable, disabled and mentally impaired victims of crime may have dif/f_i  culty communicating the impact of a crime/s in court and/or in an impact statement. This reduces the fairness of the sentencing process for marginal groups in society.\n \u00b7Constant changes in criminal behaviour may result in outdated and ineffective sentencing laws, and thus inappropriate and unjust outcomes.\n \u00b7Politically motivated agendas may result in the introduction of \u2018tough on crime\u2019 sentencing laws \u2018to protect and promote the safety of the community\u2019.\n \u00b7Sentencing practices have traditionally focused on punishment and deterrence for adult offenders, but this approach has not effectively reduced crime rates or rehabilitated offenders. This may be considered unfair, as sentencing practices have failed to address the underlying issues of the offender\u2019s behaviour and failed to create a safer community.\n \u00b7High-pro/f_i  le cases involving well-known personalities, or particularly horrifying cases, attract social media attention and can lead to close public scrutiny of the sentence options. The community may form opinions without a full understanding of the facts or of the sentencing considerations judicial of/f_i  cers must/uni00A0consider. 140  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

  "Page 154": "5.1  Civil actions\nAll members of the community have rights and obligations. Some of these rights and \nobligations fall within the criminal law and some fall within the civil law . A civil action arises when an individual suffers damage as a result of their rights being infringed by the actions or omissions of another party . The individual affected by the breach is responsible for taking the case to court.\nA remedy is sought from the party responsible for the breach. In many cases, the \ncivil wrong can be easily remedied by the parties negotiating and reaching a suitable agreement. However, if an agreement is not reached, the wronged party may seek legal advice and start legal proceedings. The person initiating a civil action is referred to as the complainant (in cases heard in the Magistrates\u2019 Court) or the plaintiff (in cases heard in the \nCounty Court or Supreme Court). The party responding is referred to as the\u00a0defendant.\nAreas of civil law\nTwo areas of civil law are torts and contract. The word \u2018tort\u2019 comes from the French word \nmeaning \u2018wrong\u2019. Civil actions may also be disputes relating to matters such as family law and inheritance.\nTorts\nThe law of torts includes actions for negligence, defamation, trespass or nuisance. A\u00a0monetary award of damages or compensation is the most common remedy in such\u00a0actions.\nContract\nContract law involves a legally binding agreement between two or more parties. Most civil\u00a0disputes concerning the law of contract involve a breach of contract. A breach of contract occurs when one of the parties has broken the terms of the agreement. The plaintiff usually wants fi  nancial compensation or an order requiring the defendant to perform or refrain from performing some specifi  c action.\nIn Australia, the legal system provides institutions and processes to resolve civil \ndisputes. These institutions include Consumer Affairs Victoria (CAV), the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT), and the courts. These bodies use a range of processes to resolve disputes. For more information on CAV and VCAT see page 162.\n5.2   The principles of justice \nand\u00a0civil law\nThe aim of the Civil Procedure Act 2010 (Vic) is to facilitate the \u2018just, effi  cient, timely and \ncost effective resolution of the real issues in dispute\u2019 through the court, whose duty is to uphold the law and administer justice. Courts are able to make any order they consider appropriate in the interests of justice when settling civil disputes.\nThe processes, procedures and institutions of the civil justice system contribute to the \nachievement of justice.\nFairness\nThe principle of a fair and unbiased hearing is central to the idea of \u2018fair play\u2019 in a civil case. The pre-trial, trial and post-trial processes and procedures aim to achieve fair outcomes for parties. The community expects that the key features of the civil justice system will apply fairly to all and that an impartial adjudicator (judge or magistrate) will\u00a0produce an outcome.\nIn our civil justice system individuals are free to initiate legal actions to resolve \ndisputes about their rights. The standard of proof in civil cases is the balance of probabilities. This means that each party has an equal opportunity to persuade the court\u00a0that their version of the facts is the most likely one.Civil law includes torts, \ncontracts and other disputes, such as family law and inheritance. 146  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 155": "Equality\nThe principle of equality is also fundamental to achieving justice in the civil justice system. \nThe civil pre-trial, trial and post-trial processes and procedures aim to provide similar and uniform treatment for all people. The rules of evidence and procedure ensure consistency and predictability and allow all parties to be treated in a uniform manner.\nAccess\nThe principle of access to the law is another value underpinning the concept of justice. The civil justice system provides a range of options for parties to resolve disputes.\nCivil disputes differ in nature and complexity . For instance, a dispute may involve a \nrelatively minor consumer complaint or a complex commercial agreement.\nIn a minor civil claim, such as those involving a consumer and a trader, the dispute \nmay be resolved with the assistance of CAV or heard and determined by VCAT. This allows a dispute over a small amount of money to be resolved in a relatively inexpensive and quick manner. However, in a civil action involving a complex commercial agreement, the case may be heard and determined by a court.\nAn individual involved in a minor consumer dispute would be unlikely to enforce their \nrights if they were faced with a lengthy and costly trial. By providing alternative means to resolve these disputes, the civil justice system tries to ensure that all individuals have access to the legal system.\n5.3  Features of a civil case\nThe key features of a civil case are that:\n\u2022 it is concerned with a dispute between two individuals and was initiated by one of \nthe parties\n\u2022 the court has provided a remedy to the dispute.\n\u2018THIS IS AN EX-PARROT \u2019\nMr Praline, from the famous Monty Python \n\u2018Dead Parrot\u2019 sketch, explains the situation: \u2018This parrot is no more! He has ceased to be! \u2019E\u2019s expired and gone to meet \u2019is maker! \u2019E\u2019s a stiff! Bereft of life, \u2019e rests in peace! If you hadn\u2019t nailed \u2019im to the perch \u2019e\u2019d be pushing up the daisies! \u2019Is metabolic processes are now \u2019istory! \u2019E\u2019s off the twig! \u2019E\u2019s kicked the bucket, \u2019e\u2019s shuf\ufb02  ed off \u2019is mortal coil, run down the curtain and joined the bleedin\u2019 choir invisible!! THIS IS AN EX- PARROT!!\u2019\nConsider the case of the bird collector who \npurchased a rare Red-Lored Amazon parrot. In the middle of the night he hears a thud, and he fi  nds the parrot dead, just a month after he bought it. \u2018I was lying in bed, and I heard a clunk, \u2019 Mr Farkas said. \u2018I\u00a0knew that poor Pepe had fallen off his perch. I raced next door and, sure enough, there he was: dead, with his claws in the air. \u2019\nMr Farkas had noticed that there was something \nwrong with the bird when it was delivered to his home. He contacted the dealer, who reassured him that the bird was only unsettled by the journey . The dealer said that there was nothing wrong with the bird and that the bird had been \ufb02  ying around her room before being delivered to him.Not satisfi  ed with the condition of the parrot, \nMr\u00a0Farkas consulted a vet. The vet\u2019s diagnosis: parrot fever. When Mr Farkas confronted the dealer with this news, the dealer claimed that Mr Farkas had mistaken the new parrot for another.\nFollowing the death of the parrot, a furious \nMr\u00a0Farkas started legal action to recover the money he had paid for the rare bird. Mr Farkas was successful in his claim, but it was a hollow victory . The judge allowed the defendant to pay the awarded damages in instalments. Mr Farkas, by then aged 72, would be 139 when he received the fi  nal payment.\n Chapter 5  Civil law and/uni00A0justice 147\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 156": "Dispute between individuals\nMr Farkas, the owner of the deceased parrot, initiated the action and is thereby known as \nthe plaintiff.\nPurpose\nA civil case aims to restore the injured party to their original position through a remedy . The court may make any one of various orders to resolve a dispute. However, as is evident in the case, the fi  nancial position of the parties may limit the effectiveness of remedies in restoring the parties to their original position. The costs of a civil action are borne by the parties in dispute. The party who loses the case may be ordered to pay the costs of both\u00a0parties.\n5.4  Key concepts of civil justice\nUpholding justice and protecting individual rights is essential for a civil justice system to operate effectively . The law recognises that individuals have the right to have their disputes determined by a \u2018competent, independent and impartial\u2019 tribunal.\nCivil law concepts recognise the importance of protecting the individual\u2019s rights to \nfairness, equality and access to the law . The key concepts protecting these values are:\nBurden of proof\nThe burden of proof refers to the responsibility the plaintiff has to present the necessary \nfacts (evidence) to establish the case against the defendant. It is fair that the party making the allegation has the task of establishing liability .\nStandard of proof\nThe standard of proof refers to the amount of evidence the plaintiff must present to the court to win. In civil law the plaintiff must present suffi  cient evidence to prove on the balance of probabilities that the facts they claim are substantially the truth. The level of evidence required is what would be regarded as adequate by a reasonable person.\nIn civil matters, such as the case of Mr Farkas, the plaintiff must prove, on the \nbalance of probabilities, that their account of the facts is right. In other words, the plaintiff must prove that their version of the facts is the more likely . In this particular case, the plaintiff had to prove to the court that, on the balance of probabilities, the dealer knew that the parrot was ill when it was sold to Mr Farkas.\nRepresentative proceedings\nThe term \u2018representative proceedings\u2019 refers to a claim brought by a group of people \nand that arises out of a similar or related legal interest. Sometimes several people may each have suffered the same type of damage as a result of an infringement of their rights. Instead of each person initiating separate legal proceedings, it may be possible for a single legal action to be started on behalf of all the people affected.

The fees are charged on top of interest when the minimum payment is not met by the due/uni00A0date.\nAttracting 43,500 disgruntled customers, the action \nwas /f_i  nanced by litigation funder IMF Bentham.\nThe class action, run by legal /f_i  rm Maurice \nBlackburn, started in 2010, when customers claimed the bank unfairly overcharged thousands of customers for paying their credit card bills late. The key issue in the challenge was whether the charges were proportionate to the cost to the bank. Customers claimed that the $33 fee was unfair, as the actual cost to the bank was a tiny fraction of this sum \u2013 often only 50 cents.In 2014, the Federal Court\u2019s Justice Michelle \nGordon (now a High Court judge) found that the fees were illegal. But the following year ANZ appealed and the decision was reversed, leading to the High Court/uni00A0challenge.\nThe High Court dismissed the claim that the fees \nwere unenforceable and the bank was engaged in unconscionable conduct.\nThe decision stopped a broader class action \nagainst/uni00A0other banks, including Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank and Westpac.

This procedure allows a legal claim to be made by many people at the same time, as long as they have sustained a similar type of harm as a result of a similar type of circumstance. It allows proceedings to be brought on behalf of a group or a class of people, making justice more easily achieved by those who are most in need.\nThe precedent for class actions of such magnitude as \nthe Black Saturday bush/f_i  res trial was set in 1998 following a gas explosion at Esso\u2019s Longford plant. Two workers were killed and Victoria\u2019s gas supply was shut down for almost two weeks.

Justify your view.\nDeciding to take civil claim\nIn any civil matter, the plaintiff will seek legal advice to establish if there is a remedy \navailable and, if so, the likelihood of success. Court action is an expensive and time-consuming process. Before any action is started, the plaintiff must consider the following.\nNegotiation options\nThere are several ways to resolve civil disputes without the need to go to trial. The majority of civil claims do not proceed to court, with 95% of all civil claims resolved through negotiated settlement. Settlement may occur after parties use one or more of the following options: informal discussion with legal representatives, mediation, conciliation and/or arbitration. Negotiation options may focus on identifying the needs and wants of each party , and generally emphasise a win\u2013win solution. This is particularly advantageous where the parties wish to maintain a relationship after the negotiation.\nBefore agreeing to a negotiated settlement, it is important for the plaintiff to seek legal \nadvice and consider a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 decisions and settlements in similar cases\n\u2022 the monetary value of the case\u2022 the chances of winning\u2022 the possible delay in going to trial\u2022 personal information that may be revealed at trial\u2022 the merits and weaknesses of the case\u2022 perhaps having to agree to give up the right to pursue any other legal action in \nexchange for a sum of money from the defendant.\nNegotiating options are always a possibility and are the least costly and most time-effi  cient \ndispute resolution process.\nCosts considerations\nIn civil matters the parties bear the costs of the action. The parties need to carefully consider the costs and the possible fi  nancial consequences if they are unsuccessful.\n\u2022 What will it cost? It is not until legal action is initiated that the costs of legal proceedings become evident. There are legal fees and report costs, payment for expert witnesses, and court costs.\n\u2022 Will I recover the costs? The cost of legal proceedings could easily be greater than the amount of compensation or damages awarded. The costs awarded by the court may also not cover all the costs of the action. Costs are usually allocated to cover \u2018in-court\u2019 action, but may not take into consideration all the actions taken before the court hearing.\n\u2022 Will the defendant be able to pay the costs? It is no use spending time and money to seek an award of damages if the defendant is a \u2018straw person\u2019 \u2013 a term used to describe someone who has no money . They will not be able to pay the compensation or the costs of the court action.Court action is costly \nand time-consuming. A/uni00A0number of factors must be taken into consideration before taking court action.\nNegotiating options are \ninformal agreements between parties which result in a settlement before trial.

The Limitation \nof Actions Act 1958 (Vic) specifi  es the time limits within which actions must be initiated in Victoria. Other legislation, including the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and the Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic), also state time limitations for civil actions.\nThe purpose of time limits is to:\n\u2022 ensure that cases are initiated while recollections of events are fresh\u2022 provide for personal and business certainty\u2022 ensure that plaintiffs act within a timely manner to resolve issues.\nLimitation periods vary depending on the type of action claimed:\nFor breaches \nof contractFor simple contracts, including oral contracts, within 6 years (section 51(1)(a) of the Limitation of Actions Act). Parties may \nagree, in the contract itself, to extend this period.\nFor tort Within 6 years (section 5(10) (a) of the Limitation of Actions Act). The time commences on the date the damage occurs.\nFor personal injury tort Within 3 years of date of \u2018discoverability\u2019 or 12 years of the date of the act/omission which caused the injury or death \n(section 27D(1) of the Limitations of Actions Act).\nSpecial provision is made for minors where the act or omission is made by a parent or guardian.In 2015 the Limitations of Actions Amendment (Child Abuse) Act was passed. It removes \u2018the limitation periods that apply \nto actions that relate to death or personal injury resulting from child abuse\u2019.\nCourts also have discretion to extend time limits to enable proceedings to be initiated \nbeyond the limitation period. Courts will grant an extension where it is believed that it is \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 to do so.

In 2003 he engaged lawyers to represent him in his WorkCover claim. The insurance company paid for his weekly bene/f_i  ts and determined that his injuries were not su\ufb03   cient to get impairment compensation. Mackenzie\u2019s lawyers did not advise him that he could take further legal action against his employer and the hotel in common law/uni00A0proceedings.\nIn 2013, Mr Mackenzie engaged another law /f_i  rm to \npursue his entitlements.\nIn May 2015, Mackenzie started action against his \nemployer and the operator of the hotel. Both defendants pleaded that Mackenzie was out of time, as he only had 6 years from the date of assault to commence action. Mackenzie sought an extension of time to bring his claim.\nThe /f_i  nding\nThe court found in favour of Mackenzie because:\n\u2022 he su\ufb00  ered physical and serious psychological \ninjuries from the accident, requiring him to have continuing treatment and medication, and resulting in disability;\n\u2022 his former lawyers did not advise him of his right to \nbring a claim in court;\n\u2022 he believed that he had exhausted all his legal rights;\u2022 after Mackenzie was encouraged to see a lawyer, he \nattended and instructed his current lawyers.\nThe court accepted that Mackenzie was a credible and honest witness; and that the delay caused no prejudice to the defendants.\nScope of liability\nThe plaintiff must establish a causal link between the defendant\u2019s actions and the harm \ncaused. In negligence it must also be shown that it is appropriate for the scope of the \ndefendant\u2019s liability to extend to the harm caused.Scope of liability for \nnegligence is stated in S51/uni00A0of the Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic). 152  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

A \u2018legal \nperson\u2019 includes corporate bodies such as companies or incorporated clubs and associations.\n \u00b7A party may be vicariously liable for the actions of another person. Vicarious liability is when one person (such as an employer) is held liable or sued for the acts or omissions of another (an employee).\nEnforcement issues\nThe fact that the plaintiff has been successful in a court action and has received a \njudgment against the defendant does not always ensure that they get paid the amount that has been awarded. If the court makes an award of damages (or an order) that the defendant does not comply with, the court can enforce it by ordering one of the following:\n\u2022 A warrant for distress: If the defendant fails to pay the amount awarded by the court, the court can order that property owned by the defendant be seized and sold to recover suffi  cient funds to the pay the amount owing.\n\u2022 A garnishee order: The plaintiff can apply to the court for a garnishee order. This\u00a0compels a third party who owes money to the defendant to pay the plaintiff.\n\u2022 An attachment of earnings: Sometimes the plaintiff applies to the court for an attachment of earnings order. This instructs the defendant\u2019s employer to deduct the amount owing from the defendant\u2019s wages or salary .\n\u2022 Sequestration: This document enables the court to appoint not fewer than 4 people to seize or control land or property owned by the defendant until the defendant complies with a judgment or until a further court order is made.\n\u2022 Bankruptcy and liquidation: The plaintiff can apply to have the defendant\u2019s assets placed under the control of an independent person or trustee. This process means that the defendant is declared bankrupt. If the defendant is a company , the plaintiff can arrange for the defendant\u2019s assets to be liquidated by placing the defendant\u2019s property under the control of a liquidator. A liquidator is a person appointed to dissolve a company . In either case, the defendant\u2019s assets are sold and the proceeds are distributed. The amount received by the plaintiff will depend on the total assets and liabilities of the defendant. Liquidation or bankruptcy does not guarantee the plaintiff recovery of the full judgment amount.\n\u2022 Imprisonment: If the defendant fails to comply with a court order, the plaintiff can take action to have the defendant imprisoned for contempt of court. This does not mean the defendant does not have to comply with the original order. In addition to the prison sentence, the court will take the necessary steps to ensure that the original court order is complied with.\nProblems relating to the enforcement of orders include fi  nancial costs, the uncertainty surrounding the value of the defendant\u2019s assets and the time delay in settling the issue.\nOther factors\nOther factors to take into consideration include:\n\u2022 What about the publicity? In some cases, litigation may result in unwanted publicity . For instance, a public personality may have been wrongfully and unlawfully detained for shoplifting. Their rights have been infringed. However, taking court action may result in more publicity about the alleged shoplifting. This\u00a0publicity may be seen as more damaging than the unlawful detention.\n\u2022 Am I likely to succeed? In cases involving complex or novel circumstances, the common law may be uncertain. There is a risk in taking these cases to court.If you lose, you will be required to pay not only compensation, but also the costs.

  "Page 163": "5.5   Methods of dispute \nresolution\nThe decision of a judge or magistrate in a court is a formal means of resolving a dispute. \nIn civil cases, court action is considered a last resort.\nInstitutions such as complaints bodies, tribunals and courts offer other avenues for \ndispute resolution. For instance, CAV provides advice to businesses, consumers, landlords \nand tenants about their rights and responsibilities. VCAT and the courts use a range of dispute resolution methods. The main alternative dispute resolution methods used to resolve a civil claim are mediation, conciliation and arbitration.\nOther dispute\nresolution methodsDetermination by \na court or tribunalDispute\nMediation Conciliation ArbitrationCivil matter\nMediation\nMany people use mediation to settle a dispute. In a mediation session, disputing parties face each other across a table and, with the help of a neutral third person (the mediator), resolve the dispute in a way that is fair and acceptable to all concerned. During mediation, the parties identify the disputed issues, develop options and consider alternatives. The parties to the dispute determine the fi  nal agreement.\nMediation is used as a dispute resolution method by a range of bodies in the \ncommunity . In some instances, the agreements reached in mediation may not be binding.\nBoth the courts and VCAT use mediation. Mediation works in tandem with, rather than \nin opposition to, the court system. The Magistrates\u2019 Court, County Court and Supreme Court refer cases to mediation. If the parties reach a settlement they can make a written agreement to this effect. The parties can apply to the court to have orders made to fi  nalise their case and give effect to their agreement.\nMEDIATION AND THE \nMAGISTRATES\u2019 COURT\nIn the Magistrates\u2019 Court, all civil cases that are being defended are referred to \neither a pre-hearing conference or mediation before they are listed for hearing. Mediations are generally held for more complex matters, where the amount in dispute is $30,000 or more. The parties will be informed of the court\u2019s intention to refer the matter to mediation. The parties are given 21 days to raise with the registrar any matters that would be relevant to a decision about mediation or when the mediation should occur. If no issues are raised by the parties, a mediation order will be made.Dispute resolution \nmethods include mediation, conciliation and arbitration.\nMediation is the process in which an impartial third person (or persons) helps the parties identify the issues in dispute and facilitates discussion of possible solutions. The parties make the /f_i  nal decision.

  "Page 164": "MEDIATION AND THE COUNTY\u00a0COURT\nAll cases in the Common-Law Division, General and Applications Lists are referred to mediation. Mediation is \nencouraged in the majority of civil cases before the County Court.\nVCAT also refers matters to mediation and has a purpose-built mediation centre. When \nVCAT refers parties to mediation, an agreement reached in mediation can become part of\u00a0an order of the tribunal.\nSHORT MEDIATIONS AT VCAT\nShort Mediation and Hearings (SMAHs) are a shortened form of mediation. If the \nparties are unable to resolve their dispute during the SMAH, the matter proceeds to hearing on the same day . SMAHs are conducted by accredited VCAT staff mediators. SMAHs are currently available in the Civil Claims List.\nRole of the mediator\nThe role of the mediator is to facilitate the discussion and help the parties identify the \nissues. There are a number of models of mediation. There may be one or more mediators involved. The mediators do not give advice or make suggestions as to what should be done. The mediators do not make a decision for the parties. Mediation does not try to discover truth or establish fault.\nProcess of mediation \nHow mediation works\nIndividuals may choose to go to mediation voluntarily or mediation may be ordered by a court or VCAT.

  "Page 165": "on the principle that people are most likely to be satisfi  ed by agreements that they have \ndeveloped themselves. Parties who have reached a mutually acceptable agreement are likely to comply with the decision. The basic characteristics of a mediation process are:\n\u2022 the parties make the decision \u2013 all parties to the dispute must agree to any \nresolution and the fi  nal decision is made by the parties\n\u2022 confi  dentiality \u2013 all discussions during the mediation process are treated as \nconfi  dential, and evidence of anything said in mediation is not admissible in court or legal proceedings\n\u2022 impartiality \u2013 the mediators are neutral, independent and impartial\n\u2022 cooperation \u2013 the parties are willing to discuss the issues.\nWHEN IS MEDIATION APPROPRIATE ?\nMediation is not suitable in all disputes. Mediation is \nappropriate in disputes where communication and discussion about the issues will lead to a resolution of the dispute. Mediation is an effective form of dispute resolution when the people involved in the dispute are prepared to discuss issues and take responsibility for how their dispute is resolved.\nMediation offers a number of signifi  cant \nadvantages over litigation, including:\n \u00b7it costs less than court action\n \u00b7it is less emotionally draining than a legal battle\n \u00b7you make your own decisions\n \u00b7if you have a continuing relationship, you can still work together\n \u00b7it focuses on future actions rather than past faults\n \u00b7it improves communication.Mediation may not be appropriate if:\n \u00b7the dispute requires an interpretation of the law or a legal ruling\n \u00b7the parties are not willing to attend the mediation and meet with the people they are in\u00a0dispute with\n \u00b7the parties are not willing to negotiate in good\u00a0faith\n \u00b7the parties are not willing to settle the dispute and reach an agreement\n \u00b7there is a history of broken agreements between the parties\n \u00b7there is an imbalance of power between the parties: for example, an ongoing history of violence between the parties.\nWhy is mediation appropriate? Why would mediation be inappropriate?\n \u00b7Mediation is often less expensive. Mediation avoids the costs of \na trial, and is signi/f_i  cantly less expensive than litigation. Parties may not require legal representation, and the fees involved for the services of mediators are lower than court fees. However, court-ordered mediation may involve a referral to use a senior barrister as a mediator, which can be quite expensive. \u00b7Is it a binding decision? Although mediation as part of a pre-hearing process with a court or tribunal may be binding, other forms of mediation are not binding. VCAT/courts can recognise the terms agreed to in mediation in court or tribunal orders.\n \u00b7Mediation is generally faster. Mediation is often quicker than going to trial, and a dispute may be resolved in a matter of days or weeks instead of months or years. \u00b7There is limited public scrutiny of mediation. Mediation may provide settlements that are con/f_i  dential. There is therefore little public scrutiny of matters resolved in this fashion. As a result, there may be limited checks that individuals are being treated fairly.\n \u00b7Win\u2013win solution. Mediation can produce a win\u2013win solution where both parties feel that they have got something out of the process. This is particularly appropriate where the parties to the dispute have to continue to have contact with one another, such as in the case of neighbours, families or business partners. \u00b7Mediation may not produce a solution. The mediation process may not produce a solution. One party may refuse to participate in good faith or may refuse to reach a compromise. If the dispute is not resolved through mediation, the parties may then have to face the usual and traditional costs. The use of mediation in these cases may add to delays in settling a dispute.\n \u00b7Informal atmosphere. The informal atmosphere of mediation encourages compromise. Mediation encourages a problem-solving approach: the parties in con/f_l  ict sit down and discuss the issues involved, consider options and reach an agreement through negotiation. It is a less intimidating method of dispute resolution than courts. \u00b7Informal atmosphere.

The process is inappropriate where the two parties have unequal power in the relationship; the more dominant party may force the other party to accept a solution which is unjust.

  "Page 166": "  Legal brief 5.1 \nMediation \u2013 increasing access to \ndispute\u00a0resolution\nOne popular form of dispute resolution method has been mediation. Over time, this \napproach has been integrated into the court process. The practical reality is that only a small minority of cases go to trial. In recent years, courts have drawn upon dispute resolution methods, such as mediation, in an effort to speed things up, to relieve the burden on the courts, to reduce the cost of dispute resolution, and simply to provide litigants with additional options.\nFor many years the only way to resolve disputes was to go to court, which was expensive. \nPeople who could not afford a solicitor or court action could not resolve their disputes. This often meant that disputes were left until the situation had become serious before action was taken. Sometimes when a judge resolves a dispute neither party is satis/f_i  ed with the outcome. This can lead to increased tension between the parties. In some cases, this can result in ongoing disputes.\nDispute Settlement Centre of Victoria\nIn Victoria, mediation centres offering free services have been set up speci/f_i  cally to encourage mediation for the resolution of minor disputes.\nThe Dispute Settlement Centre of Victoria coordinates the work of mediators \nthroughout Victoria and offers mediation and conciliation services. It deals with a variety of problems between neighbours, including disputes about fence boundaries, trees or plants, abuse between neighbours, animals, family relationships, drainage, and several other kinds of problems. The centre also deals with youth homelessness and offers a parent\u2013adolescent mediation service. The centre offers a number of services aimed at helping people resolve disputes, including:\n \u00b7advice and coaching on methods of dispute resolution\n \u00b7court-based mediation of civil claims under $40,000 at some Magistrates\u2019 Courts\n \u00b7mediation of Intervention Order applications referred by the police or the courts.\nCourts and mediation\nVictorian courts encourage the use of mediation in the great majority of civil cases. In/uni00A0 some cases mediation may be ordered, without the consent of the parties, at the pre-hearing conference or directions hearing.\nThe Supreme Court may at any stage of a civil case (with or without the consent of the \nparties) order a case to mediation. At any time, parties can ask the court to refer them to a mediator. The mediator can be appointed by the court, or agreed upon by the parties. The parties share the costs of the mediator.\nThe Family Court provides a number of mediation services to help people come to an \nagreement about matters relating to a separation or divorce. Generally mediation can cover issues relating to children, or /f_i  nancial issues, or both. A court mediator, who is a trained social worker or psychologist, conducts mediations for issues relating to children. A deputy registrar (a court lawyer) may mediate /f_i  nancial matters.

But fi  rst everyone must agree about who will attend mediation.\nIn preparation for mediation, the centre will ask the \nparticipants if they have information about their rights and responsibilities in the matter as well as:\n \u00b7What are the issues or problems to discuss?\n \u00b7How do these matters affect your day-to-day life?\n \u00b7What would you like to see happen?\n \u00b7What would you be prepared to do to help this\u00a0happen?\nThe parties are encouraged to participate in the process by expressing their view of the dispute, listening to the other party\u2019s view , and participating in the negotiations. The parties\u2019 most crucial role is to contribute to the solutions and agreements developed.Legal representatives may be present in mediation \nsessions, but they rarely attend non-court-related mediations. In court-related cases they provide expert professional advice to their clients on legal options and issues. Clients and solicitors may confer during the session or adjourn to private discussion rooms. An unrepresented party may seek legal advice after the mediation if a cooling-off period has been included in the agreement.\nSupport people can be available. They are usually \na friend, family member or neighbour accompanying a person who would otherwise be on their own. They do not participate in the discussions and negotiations during the session, but usually help the person they are with by talking over the matters that are discussed and helping them reach a suitable and satisfactory outcome.\nWitnesses and expert witnesses are not generally \nneeded. Mediation is not a process of determination, and so does not rely on the weight of evidence and testimony of witnesses to reach a resolution.\nNEWSREPORT  5.5\nMediation streamlines justice\nMEDIATION IS STREAMLINING THE WHEELS OF JUSTICE AT ALL LEVELS.  \nWhether in the Supreme Court or for minor matters, dispute resolution is cutting time and legal costs, often removing stress, and providing parties with certainty.\nThe court bene/f_i  ts from the mediation process because every case that \nsettles before reaching judgment frees up judicial time and resources for other proceedings. Multimillion-dollar claims, such as the Black Saturday bush/f_i  res and the Murrindindi Black Saturday bush/f_i  re class action, have been settled through/uni00A0mediation. \nChief Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria Marilyn Warren says mediation:\nis not an inferior type of justice. It is a di\ufb00  erent type of justice. All studies \nof dispute resolution show that people greatly value quick resolution of disputes and the opportunity to put their case in the presence of a neutral person.

  "Page 168": "Conciliation\nConciliation is a method of dispute settlement in which an impartial third party tries to \nget the disputing parties to reach an agreement. The third party is known as a conciliator. The conciliator listens carefully to all the evidence and the arguments of each party . The conciliator may suggest a resolution to the dispute but does not force the parties to reach an agreement. The decision reached by the parties is not binding unless it is incorporated into a formal settlement or incorporated into an order made by a court or a tribunal. However, as with mediation, because they have reached a mutually acceptable agreement, the parties are more likely to keep to its terms.\nConciliation is used by CAV and the courts. The Magistrates\u2019 Court uses a form of \nconciliation in pre-hearing conferences. The pre-hearing conference is a compulsory meeting of parties and/or their legal representatives at the court. The conference is normally conducted by a registrar, who will help the parties attempt to resolve the dispute. The process is informal, and discussions are confi  dential. When a pre-hearing conference does not resolve the dispute, the matter will be listed for hearing or arbitration.\nA number of lists at VCAT require the parties to attend a compulsory conference \nwhich\u00a0is like a conciliation. (A list is a section of VCAT that hears specifi  c types of cases. For instance, the Civil List would hear civil disputes, including consumer matters and retail tenancies.) The parties must attend the conference, and in some, legal representation is permitted. The VCAT member may suggest ways to settle the dispute, but the parties make the fi  nal decision. If no decision is reached the case will proceed to a hearing. If a decision is made, the VCAT member can make orders recording the\u00a0settlement.Conciliation involves an \nimpartial third party who listens to both sides and suggests ways in which the parties could resolve the dispute. The parties make the /f_i  nal decision.\nWhy is conciliation appropriate? Why would conciliation be inappropriate?\n \u00b7Parties have their say. Conciliation allows parties to have their say \nwithout strict rules of procedure. The conciliator assists but does not make the decision. The conciliator listens to the facts, makes suggestions and helps the parties come to their own decision. \u00b7Conciliation may prolong the case. If the case is not resolved, the use of conciliation may add to the delays in getting a case in court, and therefore to the cost of taking action. Conciliation is not appropriate if the dispute requires an interpretation of law.\n \u00b7Expertise of conciliator. The conciliator usually has some expertise in the area of law. For instance, conciliation conferences held by the Family Court are usually compulsory; they are between people who have not been able to reach an agreement about the division of their assets. A registrar of the court, who is an experienced family lawyer, conducts these conferences. \u00b7Conciliation relies on goodwill. A conciliator attempts to resolve a/uni00A0dispute by talking through the issues with the parties in the hope that agreement can be reached. In trying to help the parties reach agreement, conciliators may meet with the parties and indicate to them the strengths and weaknesses of their case. A/uni00A0conciliator can suggest options for settlement. However, one party may refuse to attend or may withdraw at any time.\n \u00b7Conciliation is an inexpensive and informal process. Conciliation is less costly than taking a case to court, and its informality encourages cooperation. The conciliator will help everyone discuss the complaint and work towards resolving it. They will ask questions, explain the law, point out the strengths and weaknesses of the complaint and the response and provide information about the process, make suggestions or give options for resolving the complaint. \u00b7Lack of /f_i  nality. Although the conciliator may suggest a solution, the conciliator cannot impose one. Conciliation agreements depend on both parties being willing to compromise. If no agreement is reached the process could further delay a court hearing to resolve the dispute.\n \u00b7Conciliation process is more cooperative and less competitive than court action. For this reason, the conciliation process tends to generate less ill-will between parties. Participating in a conciliation process can improve the relationship between the disputing parties. This is a key advantage in situations where the parties have an ongoing relationship, such as in parenting a child or workplace cases. \u00b7Decision may not be binding. However, a decision made in conciliation or pre-hearing court procedures may be binding. The/uni00A0terms agreed to in conciliation can be recognised in court/tribunal orders.\nArbitration\nArbitration is a method in which the parties refer the dispute to a third person to make a \ndecision. The third person is known as the arbitrator. The arbitrator resolves the dispute by listening to the views of both parties and making a decision in favour of one of the parties. The arbitrator has the power to make an order that is binding on the parties. Often\u00a0there are limited rights of appeal against an arbitrator\u2019s decision.\nThe Magistrates\u2019 Court can use arbitration to resolve civil disputes where the claim is \nless than $10,000. 160  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 169": "Why is arbitration\nappropriate?Why would arbitration \nbe\u00a0inappropriate?\n \u00b7The decision is binding. The arbitrator has the \npower to make an order that is binding on the parties. Decisions reached are /f_i  nal and enforceable in the courts. \u00b7Win\u2013lose scenario. An arbitrated decision is a decision in favour of one party: one party wins and the other party loses. One party will feel less satis/f_i  ed with the outcome of the arbitration.\n \u00b7It is more informal than court and usually faster. Arbitration also offers greater privacy to the disputants than the traditional court process. The arbitrator resolves the dispute by making an award or a decision in favour of one of the parties that is binding on both parties. While arbitration is more formal than other dispute resolution methods, it is still less formal than court proceedings. \u00b7Arbitration is not always a quick dispute resolution method. Arbitration can require a client to pass through many stages before a decision is reached. As a result, it can be confusing and does not necessarily work out to be quicker or cheaper than court proceedings.\n \u00b7The arbitrator has considerable expertise in the area. Arbitration usually involves taking the dispute to a quali/f_i  ed independent third party who has expertise in the area of the dispute. \u00b7Appeals are limited. Arbitration decisions are legally binding and enforceable but the right of appeal from such decisions is very limited \u2013 successful appeals are uncommon.\n \u00b7Costs are lower than for court. Arbitration allows individuals to recover debts or exercise their rights without facing signi/f_i  cant costs. Therefore, parties are more likely to exercise their rights. \u00b7Arbitration can be expensive. Arbitration is not always cheap \u2013 it can be as expensive as court action. Arbitration often bears similarities to court proceedings and parties may choose to have legal representation, but it is not required. In addition to paying for legal representation, the parties have to bear some of the costs of engaging the arbitrator.\nActivity 5.3  Folio exercise\nThe role of dispute resolution methods\n1 Describe the difference between conciliation and arbitration as dispute \nresolution methods.

  "Page 176": "NEWSREPORT  5.7 \nStudent\u2019s VCAT action against school fails\nA PRIVATE SCHOOL GIRL TOOK A CASE AGAINST  \nher school to VCAT, claiming that the school was \nresponsible for the fact that she did not gain entry to/uni00A0her preferred university course.\nThe student had attended the school in Year 9 and part \nof Year 10. She su\ufb00  ered glandular fever and subsequently completed her studies in Sydney. However, her ATAR score was not high enough to get her into law at the University of Sydney.\nShe sought $95,000 from the school for the additional \nfees she would incur studying law at a postgraduate level and her inability to earn income in the meantime. Her mother had sought $450,000 in lost earnings as well as the cost of moving from country NSW to Sydney, where the student /f_i  nished her schooling. They claimed that the student had failed to reach her academic potential because she did not have access to appropriate academic/uni00A0support.\nSchool sta\ufb00   told the hearing that the student was \ndisorganised and needed to be reminded to attend classes/uni00A0on time and with the relevant books.\nVCAT dismissed the claim. VCAT\u2019s Deputy President, \nIan Lulham, found that the student had failed to see that attending class, having access to school tutoring facilities and additional input from a teacher were all forms of academic support.\nIn his judgment, he said: \u2018Support does not mean that \nthe school does the work for the/uni00A0student.\u2019\n5.8   Appropriateness of VCAT \nin\u00a0resolving disputes\nStrengths of VCAT dispute resolution\nDispute resolution methods used by VCAT include mediation and compulsory \nconferences. In many instances the parties reach a mutual agreement. This is sometimes described as a \u2018win\u2013win\u2019 situation. The parties are able to discuss issues, explore possible solutions and reach a decision. Of course, in the case of a hearing, the fi  nal decision is made by a third party . The use of VCAT is seen as having a number of strengths that contribute to its appropriateness in resolving disputes:\n\u2022 VCAT is less costly: VCAT provides an effi  cient, low-cost, informal and less intimidating access to high-quality dispute resolution and decision-making for civil cases. The cost of applying for a dispute to be heard before VCAT is far lower than the cost of taking a case to court, where you would have to pay for legal advice, legal representation and perhaps even a jury (for civil court cases). For instance, the 2016\u201317 fee for a small claim (involving an amount of less than $15,000) was $204.90. In small claims cases the parties must represent themselves, so there is no fi  nancial outlay for legal representation. As no costs are awarded, the parties are assured that there will be no fi  nancial burden other than what the tribunal considers to be an appropriate resolution of the dispute. There are grounds for waiving application fees in cases of fi  nancial hardship. However, costs in other matters can be greater. The fees for planning disputes in the Planning and Environment \u2013 Major Case List can be in excess of $3000.\n\u2022 VCAT is less intimidating: VCAT provides an alternative to the formal justice system. For many parties, this is a less intimidating form of dispute resolution than courts, because of the absence of strict rules of evidence and procedure. The hearing of evidence and examination of witnesses is less formal. VCAT removes one of the most signifi  cant barriers to a person pursuing their legal rights through legal action \u2013 the risk of a costs order against you if the dispute is not resolved in your favour. At VCAT, parties are generally expected to bear their own costs, unless the tribunal orders otherwise. This gives individuals greater access to dispute resolution methods.Dispute resolution \nmethods used by VCAT have a number of strengths. 168  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 177": "\u2022 VCAT is faster: VCAT allows a more timely resolution of disputes. As the hearings \nare generally less formal there are fewer pre-hearing requirements around preparing a dispute to go before VCAT. VCAT aims for a shorter time period from application to settlement than the courts. If the parties cannot reach a decision, VCAT will make a decision. In recent times VCAT has been subject to delays because it has become the preferred dispute resolution body for many disputes.\n\u2022 VCAT hearings are conducted in a less formal manner: VCAT does not use the strict rules of evidence and procedure used by courts. The parties are given the opportunity to put their case in their own words. This process is less intimidating than the formal procedure of questions and answers used in courts.\n\u2022 The parties are encouraged to reach an agreement themselves: This may happen either before a hearing or in the early stages of a hearing. VCAT can use\u00a0mediation or conciliation to encourage the parties to reach an agreement. If\u00a0the parties cannot, the matter will go to a hearing and a binding decision will be\u00a0handed down.\nWeaknesses of VCAT dispute resolution\nVCAT works effi  ciently and provides a low-cost method of dispute resolution. However, \nthere are a few weaknesses, which include:\n\u2022 VCAT is only suitable for civil disputes: VCAT is not used in criminal matters. Also, complex civil disputes involving larger amounts may be more appropriately resolved by the court system. VCAT\u2019s focus is usually on minor civil matters, reviews of administrative decisions or social issues.\n\u2022 Escalating cost of VCAT hearings: The cost of VCAT hearings has escalated in recent years. This is due to an increase in the number of people using legal representation. Although in some lists (such as the Civil Claims List) legal representation is generally not permitted, VCAT will allow parties to be legally represented if they both agree or in certain circumstances. For instance, the Residential Tenancies List allows legal representation in all cases involving an eviction. As a result, some costs of taking a claim to VCAT have increased. The VCAT hearing process used to resolve discrimination matters may be just as expensive and formal as courts. In these cases, VCAT may not be cheaper than taking a\u00a0dispute to court.\n\u2022 When parties are unable to reach a decision: In this situation VCAT will make a decision which is binding on the parties. This will result in one of the parties feeling less satisfi  ed with the fi  nal outcome. Also, an individual may compromise too much to resolve the dispute if they are intimidated or manipulated by a stronger party .\n\u2022 Limited right of appeal: There is a limited right to appeal against a decision made by VCAT. An appeal can only be made on a point of law . The positive is that this restricts further costs.\nVCAT REFORMS\nThere have been a number of recent reforms in the \noperation of VCAT. They have aimed at improving access to dispute resolution and reducing the costs.\nThe 2015\u201316 VCAT Annual Report identifi  ed the \nfollowing reforms:\n \u00b7video conferencing to improve access for people in remote areas\n \u00b7improving support for self-representation \u00b7improved customer service with extended opening hours and a pilot concierge service at\u00a0the main hearing venue\n \u00b7a new online system to help landlords and tenants access and manage their cases at any\u00a0time\n \u00b7improved application access via new online\u00a0forms.Dispute resolution \nmethods used by VCAT are less expensive, less time-consuming and less formal (or intimidating) than traditional courts.\nThe parties are encouraged to reach an agreement themselves, but they can walk away from mediation or a compulsory conference.\nVCAT is not suitable \nfor/uni00A0all/uni00A0disputes.\nThe cost of VCAT \nhearings/uni00A0has escalated in recent years, as more parties are now using legal/uni00A0representation.\nThere is a limited right to \nappeal against a decision made by VCAT.\nVCAT provides a winner/\nloser resolution similar to the courts.

These courts are \norganised into a hierarchy \u2013 a ranking in order. In the Victorian court hierarchy the Magistrates\u2019 Court, the County Court and the Supreme Court (Trial Division and Court of Appeal) have the jurisdiction to hear civil matters. The Victorian hierarchy also includes the High Court of Australia, which has jurisdiction over matters that relate to the whole of Australia.\nEach court has its own civil jurisdiction. The term \u2018civil jurisdiction\u2019 means power to \nhear and determine a civil dispute. In other words, each court has the power to hear and determine certain types of civil cases. The Magistrates\u2019 Court deals with minor cases, and the Supreme Court deals exclusively with the most serious matters.Courts are arranged in a \nhierarchy or a ranking.\nAll courts in the Victorian hierarchy have civil jurisdiction, which means they have the power to hear and determine civil claims up to a speci/f_i  ed level.\nTable 5.3 Court civil jurisdictions\nOriginal jurisdiction Appellate jurisdiction\nHigh Court  \u00b7Constitutional matters \n(/f_i  ve\u2013seven justices)\n \u00b7Federal matters (one justice) \u00b7Appeals from a single justice of the High Court\n \u00b7Appeals from the Full Court of State Supreme Courts \u2013 in Victoria, appeals from the Court of Appeal (at least two justices)\nSupreme Court of Victoria \u2013 \nCourt of Appeal \u00b7Appeals from a single judge of the Supreme or \nCounty Court\nSupreme Court of Victoria \n(Trial Division) \u00b7Damages claims for unlimited amounts \n(one/uni00A0justice with an optional jury of six) \u00b7An appeal on a point of law from a Magistrates\u2019 Court (one/uni00A0justice)\nCounty Court of Victoria  \u00b7Damages claims for unlimited amounts (one/uni00A0justice with an optional jury of six)\nMagistrates\u2019 Court  \u00b7Claims up to $100,000 170  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

In some suburban and regional Magistrates\u2019 Courts claims for less than $40,000 are referred to mediation provided by the Dispute Settlement Centre of Victoria. A registrar reviews the case and decides if the case is suitable to be referred to mediation. Alternatively , the matter may be referred directly to a pre-hearing conference.\nConciliation\nPre-hearing conferences in the Magistrates\u2019 Court use the process of conciliation. Parties to a dispute may apply to have a pre-hearing conference. Magistrates or registrars may also refer cases to a pre-hearing conferences. A pre-hearing conference will be used when the court believes that it will encourage an out-of-court settlement or if there are complex issues and some of them can be resolved before a court hearing.The Magistrates\u2019 Court \nis the lowest court and hears civil claims up to $100,000.\nSome Magistrates\u2019 Courts refer some civil disputes to mediation where the amount is less than $40,000.\n For more \ninformation on the Magistrates\u2019 Court, go to www.magistratescourt.vic.gov.au.

  "Page 184": "5.10   Reasons for a court hierarchy\nThere are a number of signifi  cant reasons for structuring our courts as a hierarchy . \nA\u00a0number of these reasons were discussed in relation to the hearing of criminal cases in\u00a0Chapter 3.\nReasons for a court hierarchy include the need to reduce delays and the right to \nappeal. The right of appeal is an important feature of our legal system, as it gives an individual the opportunity to have their case determined in another court, thereby ensuring certainty , consistency and fairness. How could an individual exercise their right\u00a0to an appeal in a legal system that offered only one level of court?\nThe main reasons for a court hierarchy are therefore to enable the following.\nAdministrative convenience\nA court hierarchy makes effi  cient use of the limited fi  nancial and physical resources \navailable. A hierarchy of courts allows for the allocation of cases according to their complexity and thereby reduces the likelihood of delays. This effi  ciency provides cost savings and promotes timely access for litigants. Minor civil cases can be allocated to the lower courts where they can be heard relatively quickly . More complex civil matters generally take longer to hear. These cases are heard in higher courts by judges with the expertise to deal with such matters. The jurisdiction of each court is clearly established so\u00a0people do not waste time, money and energy initiating an action in an inappropriate\u00a0court.\nAppeals\nFundamental to the concept of justice is the right to appeal. An appeal allows for the review of decisions made by courts. A system of review would not be possible without a\u00a0court hierarchy . People who believe that they have grounds for an appeal would not have\u00a0the opportunity to have their case heard again in a superior court by a judge with special knowledge and expertise.\nThe system of precedent is largely reliant on appeals from the lower courts. Many \nprecedents would never be established if there were no opportunity for an individual to\u00a0appeal against the decision made by an adjudicator in a lower court.\nOther reasons\nPrecedent\nThe doctrine of judicial precedent is largely dependent on a hierarchy of courts. \nPrecedents are established in the superior courts and binding on all courts lower in the hierarchy , thereby providing consistency in decisions. The doctrine of precedent cannot operate unless there is a hierarchy of courts.\nSpecialisation\nA court hierarchy enables the workload of the courts to be spread, and for courts to \ndevelop expertise in hearing particular types of disputes. A judge in the Family Court, for\u00a0instance, can become fully conversant with matters relating to family law .\nTime and money\nA court hierarchy enables minor matters to be dealt with relatively quickly and in a cost-effective manner in the Magistrates\u2019 Court rather than in the County Court or Supreme Court, where it may cost thousands of dollars and take years before the case is\u00a0fi  nally determined.A court hierarchy provides \nfor the most ef/f_i  cient use of court resources and avoids delays.\nA court hierarchy allows for a system of review.\nA court hierarchy is necessary for the doctrine of precedent to operate.\nA court hierarchy allows each court to develop the skills, expertise and processes to deal with speci/f_i  c types of disputes.\nA court hierarchy allows \nminor cases to be heard relatively quickly and in a/uni00A0less costly manner. 176  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

Not good enough, fumed Con Kay, who is still seeking damages.\nAnd the bird? \u2018Spy\u2019 is happy to report that Goldie lives to /f_i  ght his own legal battles. \n\u2018The farm owners didn\u2019t have the heart to put Goldie down,\u2019 explained barrister Jim Bassell, who is representing the rooster. \u2018He is staying with a couple of psychologists, friends of the/uni00A0McKays.\u2019\nMr McKay said that when he heard of his neighbour\u2019s concern he did his best to silence \nhis foghorned leghorn. \u2018I even phoned the council, who told me I should perhaps treat the rooster like a power tool and not allow it to make any noise after 7pm on week nights and 9pm on weekends,\u2019 he said.\nConsequently, each night for about a year, Mr McKay rounded up the bird, put it in a \ncage and shut it inside his car. Apart from one unfortunate escape, when Goldie spent the night next door in imminent danger of putting a deposit on Mr Kay\u2019s luxury car, the problem was thought to be resolved.\nNot so, according to the lawyer\u2019s deposition. After issuing an injunction against the \nrooster, which e\ufb00  ectively forbade it to enter its own garden, Mr Kay sent the McKays a summons that listed 37 alleged stressful and noisy incidents.\nIf successful in the County Court, the writ could result in thousands of dollars in/uni00A0damages.\nMr McKay said that the male o\ufb00  spring from successful unions between Goldie and the \nfamily chooks had been given to friends. He wondered how many more neighbourhood disputes had been triggered by his generosity. \u2018I suppose it\u2019s the circles you move in, but all our friends have roosters,\u2019 he said. \u2018Other groups of people may get together and talk about what was on television, but we get together and talk about chickens.\u2019\nLawrence Money, The Age\nActivity 5.6  Folio exercise\nNeighbours in dispute\nRead the \u2018The chook, the shrink, the lawyer and his Ferrari\u2019 and prepare a report that deals with all the/uni00A0following:\n1 List the facts of the case.\n2 Describe the role and function of the County Court.\n3 Explain the dispute resolution method used.\n4 Outline the other dispute resolution methods that could have been used in this/uni00A0case.\n5 Decide which method of dispute resolution you believe would have been most appropriate in this case \nand/uni00A0explain your choice.\n6 Identify the problem/s in accessing the law highlighted by this article.

  "Page 186": "5.11   Appropriateness of courts \nin\u00a0resolving disputes\nThe civil justice system presents individuals with a range of ways in which they can \nresolve disputes. Taking a case to court is a costly process, but there are some cases that\u00a0must be heard by a court.\nStrengths of courts\nWhere complex fact or legal issues are involved, determination by a judge or a \nmagistrate may be the most appropriate dispute resolution option. The court system uses an adversarial process to hear cases. This includes strict rules of evidence and procedure. Some people fi  nd this formality intimidating. Furthermore, it also means that legal representation is required. Therefore, going to court to resolve a civil dispute is costly and time-consuming. However, the courts do have the power to make a fi  nal and binding\u00a0decision.\nThe advantages of using a range of other methods to resolve civil disputes have been \nrecognised by the courts: they do refer parties to mediation, conciliation and arbitration.\nThe reasons for courts being considered appropriate bodies for the resolution of \ndisputes include:\n\u2022 Courts provide a binding resolution: Courts use a range of dispute resolution methods to resolve disputes. If parties are unable to resolve a dispute using these methods, a judicial determination by a court provides a resolution which is fi  nal and\u00a0binding.\n\u2022 Courts can adjudicate on a range of civil disputes: The court hierarchy enables courts to specialise in hearing specifi  c types of cases such as family law and tort law , and so develop appropriate procedures to effectively settle these disputes.\n\u2022 Courts allow for legal representation to prepare and present the case: Every party in a dispute has the right to seek legal representation to argue their case. The use of legal representation ensures that both parties are treated equally and that each party has the opportunity to present their side of the facts in an objective, reasoned\u00a0way .\n\u2022 Courts follow strict rules of evidence and procedure: Courts follow strict rules of evidence and procedure, and aim to ensure that each party has an equal opportunity to present their case and challenge the evidence presented by the opposing side.\n\u2022 Courts are bound by the principles of natural justice: An important feature of Australia\u2019s legal system is that the person presiding over the case (judge or magistrate) must ensure that the rules of natural justice are observed. Natural justice is based on the concept of \u2018fair play\u2019 and was originally developed through the common law . According to the principles of natural justice, every person is entitled to a fair and unbiased hearing. Courts must remain impartial at all times. Both parties are considered equal before the law and have the right to present their version of the facts to the court, which will not favour either party .Taking a civil dispute to \ncourt provides a binding decision but is very costly and time-consuming.\nCourts are bound by the principles of natural/uni00A0justice. 178  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 187": "Weaknesses of courts\nThe use of courts to resolve disputes may be seen as inappropriate in a number of \ncircumstances. These include:\n\u2022 Courts are very expensive: Courts are very expensive due to court costs and the need for legal representation. The unsuccessful party in a civil matter has to consider the possibility of paying large amounts in damages, party\u2013party costs (what a court orders one party to pay the other as part of the terms of settlement) and court costs. Even the successful party will be out of pocket, because whatever amount is awarded will not cover all their solicitor costs. This may prevent or discourage some parties from pursuing a valid civil claim through the courts. This is particularly a concern for those parties whose dispute cannot be settled through other dispute resolution methods or is outside the jurisdiction of VCAT.\n\u2022 Court cases are time-consuming: Preparation and exchange of civil pre-trial documents, scheduling of pre-trial conferences and the trial itself can take up a lot of time. In addition, court workloads and the availability of one\u2019s barrister can cause delays. Plaintiffs who have suffered serious injury may be placed under huge\u00a0fi  nancial strain because of delays and may be pressured to settle for a lesser\u00a0sum rather than wait to go to trial.\n\u2022 There is a need for legal representation: Lack of legal representation may hinder \naccess to justice or equal treatment. Individuals who are unable to afford their own legal representative and are ineligible for legal aid are at a huge disadvantage in the court system. In civil cases, Legal Aid is often unable to represent parties. Individuals who cannot afford legal representation may fi  nd it diffi  cult to prepare a case and understand proceedings. Their chances of presenting a successful case in\u00a0a courtroom, pitted against an experienced lawyer, are not good.\n\u2022 Court decision may not be an appropriate method in all disputes: A fi  nal determination by a court creates a situation where there is a winner and a loser. This may not be appropriate where there is an ongoing relationship between disputing parties. For instance, if the dispute is between neighbours, the winner and\u00a0loser outcome may in fact escalate the dispute in the future rather than settle it.\n5.12   Should I go to a court \nor\u00a0VCAT?\nThere are several questions that an individual should answer when deciding which \ndispute resolution body to use. First, consider the nature of the dispute. Does the dispute involve complex legal issues? Other questions to be considered include the following:\n\u2022 How formal is the process?\n\u2022 How much will it cost?\u2022 Who makes the decision?\u2022 What impact will it have on my relationship with the other party?\u2022 Will the other party attend?\u2022 How long will it take?\u2022 Do I need a lawyer?\u2022 Is the decision binding?\u2022 Is there a right of appeal?\nIn deciding which method is most appropriate, consider the strengths and weaknesses of \ncourts and VCAT. These strengths and weaknesses are summarised in Table 5.4.Courts are very expensive \ndue to high court costs and the need for legal representation.\nCourt cases are time-consuming.\nIndividuals who are unable to afford their own legal representative and are ineligible for legal aid are at a huge disadvantage in the court system.\nJudicial processes are adversarial, and there is/uni00A0always a winner and a/uni00A0loser.

  "Page 188": "Table 5.4 Comparison of courts and VCAT\nQuestions to \nconsiderCourts VCAT\nHow formal is \nthe process?Determination by a judge or magistrate in the courts \nuses a formal adversarial process to resolve disputes. This includes the use of strict rules of procedure and evidence that aim to ensure that all parties are treated equally. However, an individual may /f_i  nd that the formal procedures used in the courts are intimidating.VCAT is generally less formal than the courts and does not follow the same strict rules of procedure and evidence. An individual is less likely to feel intimidated. However, this may be a disadvantage when the parties are not equally able to present their views.\nHow long will \nit/uni00A0take?The pre-trial and trial processes used by the courts allow \ntime for the preparation of cases and for the issues to be examined in detail. However, the time required to prepare a case for court may result in delays in settling a dispute. Delays may also occur due to the workload of/uni00A0the courts.VCAT can hear cases relatively quickly. If the parties cannot reach a decision, VCAT will make a binding decision.\nHow much \nwill/uni00A0it/uni00A0cost?The costs of taking court action can be signi/f_i  cant \nbecause each party is responsible for preparing and presenting their case. This requires legal advice. The costs of court action may mean that some people do not/uni00A0have the opportunity to fully exercise their rights.VCAT is less costly than going to court.\nA relatively small fee is charged and in some lists the \nuse/uni00A0of legal representation is generally not allowed.\nDo I need \na/uni00A0lawyer?In most instances, a party will require legal \nrepresentation. This ensures that all parties are treated equally. However, legal representation adds to the costs of taking action.In some lists legal representation is not allowed. Although this reduces the costs of taking action, an individual may be disadvantaged if they are not con/f_i  dent in presenting their own case.\nWho makes \nthe/uni00A0decision?A magistrate, judge or the option of a judge and jury in \na higher court. This means that an impartial body makes the decision. However, the use of a jury will add to the costs of a case.The parties are encouraged to reach an agreement. This/uni00A0means that the parties are more likely to feel satis/f_i  ed with the outcome, as they are part of the decision-making process. However, if no agreement is/uni00A0reached a decision is made for the parties. One party may compromise too much.\nIs the decision \nbinding?The court determines a winner and a loser. The decision \nof the court is binding.Orders made by VCAT are binding and enforceable. When the parties reach a decision it is a win\u2013win situation. However, where VCAT makes a decision for/uni00A0the/uni00A0parties there is a winner and a loser.\nWhat impact will \nit have on my relationship with the other party?Courts use an adversarial approach, which may result in \nanimosity between the parties.VCAT uses mediation and compulsory conferences. These processes allow the parties to reach a mutually acceptable resolution. This may preserve the ongoing relationship between the parties. However, in a tribunal determination a decision is made for the parties. One party may be antagonised by the decision.\nWill the other \nparty have to attend?If a defendant does not appear, the court may make a \ndecision in their absence.If a party does not appear, VCAT may make a decision in/uni00A0their absence.\nCan the decision \nbe reviewed?The courts have a right of appeal \u2013 this is consistent with \nthe principles of justice.VCAT has a limited right of appeal.\nActivity 5.7  Folio exercise\nAre alternative dispute resolutions more\u00a0appropriate?\nA recent report states:\nThe practice of using alternative dispute resolution methods has become an accepted part of the \nAustralian court system. Courts, such as the Magistrates\u2019 Court, direct parties to mediation, conciliation and arbitration aimed at clarifying issues and promoting settlement. VCAT has been established utilising these methods. However, while dispute resolution methods are credited with high settlement rates, some commentators remain cautious about their bene/f_i  ts.\n1 Outline the dispute resolution methods discussed in the quotation.\n2 Using examples, explain how VCAT uses alternative dispute resolution methods.\n3 Discuss and justify the dispute resolution methods used by the Magistrates\u2019/uni00A0Court.\n4 Explain why courts remain an essential dispute resolution option in civil cases. 180  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

An affi  davit of documents must be fi  led and a copy must be served on the \nparty requesting discovery . The affi  davit of documents identifi  es the documents that are or have been in the possession of the party making the affi  davit.  Parties can inspect the documents listed and demand that copies of documents relevant to the case be produced. This is done by serving a Notice to Produce. Generally , a party cannot refuse to produce documentary evidence if requested to do so by the other party . Failure to provide the documents means that the documents cannot be produced as evidence in court. The court has the power to prevent unnecessary discovery . The court may order that discovery is not required or should be limited to specifi  ed documents or questions.\n\u2022 promotes an out-of-court settlement, since the parties gain a greater understanding \nof their chances of success in court.\nInterrogatories\nBoth parties have a right to request more information from the other or to ask further questions to gain a better understanding of the facts.

Interrogatories must be answered in writing, by affi  davit.The discovery process \nincludes more information relevant to the case.\nDiscovery can include the inspection of relevant documents.\nDiscovery can include asking speci/f_i  c questions, known as interrogatories. 186  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

Increased judicial powers to guide and speed civil pre-trial, trial and post-trial processes means the parties and legal representatives must comply with specifi  c timelines. Failure to do so may result in fi  nes from the court. The judiciary adopts a \u2018case manager approach\u2019 and maintains control of the case from its initiation to its settlement.

The Supreme Court (General Civil Procedure) Rules 2005 (Vic) contain procedures to help the Commercial court manage cases, including rules regarding direction hearings, further directions, and case management conferences.

This dispute resolution process/uni00A0is now widely recognised by the/uni00A0Supreme Court as a means of reducing the backlog of civil cases. Mediation has also been used by the County Court. The Magistrates\u2019 Court has the power to refer cases to mediation provided by the Dispute Settlement Centre of Victoria.\nWhen should mediation be used?\nMediation is appropriate for most of the/uni00A0disputes that come before our courts. Whether a case can be resolved by mediation will depend on a number of/uni00A0factors.\nFirst, the parties must be willing, and \nthey must be capable of discussion and negotiation. The primary intention of the parties in attending the mediation sessions must be to settle the dispute.\nSecond, the parties need to be on an \nequal standing. In/uni00A0other words, one party should not be more powerful than the other.\nThird, the parties need to be in equal bargaining positions for mediation to be e\ufb00  ective. Each party needs to be aware of the range of options and be in a position to/uni00A0make real choices.\nMediation is most e\ufb00  ective if it is used \nearly in a dispute. As a dispute develops, individuals tend to develop polarised views. Perceptions of injustice rise, and the dispute builds over time. These emotions will hinder the dispute resolution process.\nHowever, mediation cannot take place \nuntil issues have been de/f_i  ned. Each party will need an understanding of the other\u2019s claim. To achieve this there needs to be adequate exchange of information between the parties. In some cases \u2013 which would otherwise be heard before a higher court \u2013 this may not be possible until pleadings have been conducted.\n Chapter 5  Civil law and/uni00A0justice 189\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

The successful mediation resulted in signi/f_i  cant cost and time savings for the community, the legal system and all parties involved. Importantly, it also saved witnesses and victims the psychological and emotional stress/uni00A0of enduring a/uni00A0lengthy trial.\nIn July 2014, Justice Dixon, who was hearing the \npreliminary arguments in the class action, referred the matter to the Court\u2019s Appropriate Dispute Resolution (ADR) [commonly also known as Alternative Dispute Resolution] team for judicial mediation by Associate Justice Efthim, in the hope that a settlement could be reached without the matter having to go to trial.\nAssociate Justice Efthim convened preliminary \nmeetings involving representatives from both parties and expert witnesses. His Honour engaged an expert mathematician and valuer to determine a sample by which [the] quantum of the claim could be estimated. A valuer was then engaged to obtain a relevant sample by which the question of loss could be estimated.\nCase management conferences were next held \nwith the valuer and the parties to estimate loss. When/uni00A0the parties were in agreement as to the estimate of the loss, the mediation commenced.\nThe matter was settled, through mediation, \nwithout the need for a trial. The mediation resulted in a $300/uni00A0million settlement, without admissions of liability, and brought an end to the multiple legal actions arising/uni00A0from the deadly 2009 Murrindindi bush/f_i  re.\nJudicial mediation in this matter allowed for a \nstreamlined process, and made full use of the Court\u2019s facilities and expertise in complicated class actions. The e\ufb03   ciency of the judicial mediation system is clear.\nIt must be duly noted and acknowledged that \nAssociate Justice Efthim played a pivotal role assisting the parties to resolve the case.\nUpon settlement, Justice Dixon thanked the parties, \nassisted by their lawyers and the mediator (Associate Justice Efthim) for the sensible and necessary compromises that had brought the Murrindindi proceeding to a/uni00A0close.\u2018Active management of these proceedings by \njudges facilitated timely disclosure of documents, evidence, expert opinions and arguments and helped all those involved in these disputes, whether as plainti\ufb00  s, defendants, witnesses, experts or lawyers, to /f_i  nd an appropriate compromise. Resolution of so many claims within that time frame is an achievement worthy of note.\u2019\nThe settlement was subject to Court approval (as \nare all class actions), largely to safeguard the interests of group members. The settlement was approved by Justice Emerton in May 2015.\nThe settlement of the Murrindindi class action \nfollowed the settlement of the separate class action in relation to the Kilmore East\u2013Kinglake /f_i  re. In contrast, this matter went through an external mediation/uni00A0process.\nOn 15 July 2014, after a 200-day trial before \nJustice/uni00A0Jack Forrest, the parties agreed to a settlement without admission of liability worth $494 million, the largest in Australian legal history. The Court heard the application on 24 and 25 November 2014 and received approval from Justice Osborn on/uni00A023/uni00A0December 2014.\nThe Supreme Court of Victoria is supervising the \nongoing process of distribution of settlement funds as/uni00A0it has done with earlier Court-approved settlements arising out of the Beechworth, Coleraine, Horsham and Pomborneit /f_i  res.\nKey issues in this matter included the pre-trial \nmanagement of 40 expert witnesses, the use of expert/uni00A0conclaves, the e\ufb00  ectiveness of concurrent evidence and the use of expert assessors to assist judicial o\ufb03   cers.\nThe length and scope of the Kilmore East\u2013Kinglake \ntrial also demanded that the Court adopt /f_l  exible and innovative case management practices, including the use of a paperless \u2018e-trial\u2019 .\nSince settlement, the Court has commissioned \nresearch into the way in which these issues were addressed in the context of the Kilmore East\u2013Kinglake trial which will highlight lessons to be learned for the future conduct of a large-scale litigation.

  "Page 200": "5.15  The civil trial\nThe purpose of a civil trial is to facilitate the just resolution of disputes, \u2018as quickly , \ninexpensively and effi  ciently as possible\u2019. A number of personnel play a role and hold key responsibilities in the delivery of a just outcome: the judge, the jury , the parties and the legal practitioners. Each has specifi  c responsibilities and tasks to perform to ensure that the outcome balances the interests of the plaintiff and those of the defendant.\nResponsibilities of the judge\nA civil trial may be heard by a judge or by a judge and a jury . The judge has a \nresponsibility to act as an impartial and independent adjudicator. The judge must not intervene unnecessarily in the conduct of the case, and must remain neutral, act impartially and treat each party equally . The judge cannot help the parties in the presentation of their case, either by prompting a party to ask an appropriate question of a witness or by introducing a legal issue. The judge can only ask questions of witnesses when it is necessary to clear up a point that has been overlooked or obscured. The judge\u2019s duties include:\n\u2022 Enforcing the rules of evidence and procedure: The judge must ensure that each party acts according to the rules of procedure so that each has an equal opportunity to present their case.\n\u2022 Ensuring that the plaintiff has legally established the \u2018burden of proof\u2019.\n\u2022 Overseeing the jury selection and empanelling process: The judge is responsible for the process through which a jury is selected and empanelled.\n\u2022 Summarising the facts and explaining the relevant law to the jury.\n\u2022 Deciding the admissibility of evidence: The judge may prevent a jury hearing inadmissible evidence because that evidence may prejudice the jury\u2019s fi  nal decision.\n\u2022 Deciding all questions of law and ruling on their relevance: Although each party may present evidence to suggest the relevant law that applies to their case, the ultimate decision as to the relevant law is the responsibility of the judge. \n\u2022 Deciding questions of fact when there is no jury: In the Magistrates\u2019 Court, for example, the magistrate performs the role of both judge and jury . The magistrate decides which version of the facts presented is most likely to be true and how the law applies to those facts. Once these two issues have been decided, the magistrate reaches a decision (verdict). In the County Court or the Supreme Court, where a jury is present, the jury is the trier of facts. The jury must decide their verdict on the facts of the case and how the law , as prescribed by the judge, applies to the facts.\n\u2022 Determining the remedy: In a civil case, the plaintiff can choose to have either the judge or the jury determine the appropriate award. In defamation cases a jury cannot determine damages.\nThe impartiality of the judge in a civil trial promotes fair and equal treatment and is \nseen as the key to ensuring that the principles of justice are upheld. When a decision is made by an independent body , it is more likely to be accepted by the parties and the community as a fair decision.\nIf either party has opted for a trial by judge and jury , the trial will start with the \nempanelling of the jury . The jury panel will consist of six jurors. Each party is permitted to challenge three of the potential jurors from a list of 12, without having to give a reason for the challenge: each party is asked to cross three names off the list of 12 potential jurors.\nAn additional two jurors may be selected in long cases. However, only six jurors make \nthe fi  nal decision.\nWhere there is a judge and a jury , the judge presents a summary of the evidence and \nthe issues presented by the parties to the jury . When doing this, the judge again must act impartially and treat each party equally .The judge is an impartial \numpire, responsible for empanelling a jury, deciding the admissibility of evidence, applying the rules of procedure, deciding questions of law, deciding the verdict (if there is no jury) and deciding the remedy.\nIn 2017 the Justice Legislation Amendment (Court Security, Juries and other matters) Act reduced peremptory challenges in civil trials from three to two. These changes are to come into effect 1/uni00A0May/uni00A02018. 192  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 201": "Responsibilities of the jury\nThe jury is not an essential feature of the civil trial process and is used in only approximately \n2% of cases in the County and Supreme Courts. Their responsibilities include:\n\u2022 listening to and evaluating evidence\n\u2022 determining questions of fact and applying the law as explained by the judge\u2022 deciding fault and awarding damages\u2022 remaining unbiased and making a decision on the evidence presented.\nThe jury safeguards the rights of the parties by re\ufb02  ecting community standards and \nthus promoting justice that is in line with community values. Impartiality is central to the concept of a fair trial. The random selection process and the checks to excuse potential jurors ensure a fair trial.\nWHAT ARE THE RESPONSIBILITIES  OF THE \nJURY IN A CIVIL TRIAL?\nEither party to a civil case can request a jury , \nproviding they are prepared to meet the cost. The jury\u2019s main task is to listen to the evidence presented by both parties, and to consider the facts of the case according to the relevant law . The standard of proof required is on the \u2018balance of probabilities\u2019. The \u2018balance of probabilities\u2019 means that one account of the facts is, on balance, more probable than the other. If the jury is unable to reach a unanimous decision after 3 hours, a majority verdict (fi  ve out of six jurors) is acceptable. The task of the civil jury does not stop at delivering the verdict. If the jury decides in favour of the plaintiff, then it may also be asked to decide the extent of damages to be awarded to the plaintiff. The jury may also need to consider whether the plaintiff can be blamed in part for any of the loss, damage or suffering. If so, the plaintiff\u2019s award of damages is reduced in proportion to the extent of blame.\nSHOULD JURIES \nASSESS\u00a0 DAMAGES ?\nUsing juries in civil cases to determine the level of damages has been criticised. \nIt\u00a0is claimed that there are inconsistencies between the amounts awarded by different juries in similar cases. A jury does not give reasons for its decision. It does not account for how it arrived at the fi  nal amount of damages awarded. This means that it is diffi  cult to know if the jury has taken into account all aspects of damages, such as pain and suffering. In some cases, juries are said to be \u2018excessively generous\u2019. This criticism is frequently made of juries in cases of negligence involving an individual and an insurance company . On the other hand, some jury estimations of damages can be very conservative. The diffi  culty in predicting how juries will calculate damages discourages some people from using a jury in a civil case. In defamation cases, damages can only be assessed by the judge.Under the Defamation Act \n2005 (Vic) juries cannot determine damages in defamation cases.\nActivity 5.10  Folio exercise\nJuries in civil trials\nDescribe how juries operate in the civil justice system and outline their key responsibilities in a case. \nYour/uni00A0response should consider:\n \u00b7the number of jurors who form the jury in each class of case\n \u00b7the circumstances in which a jury trial is required and those in which it is not\n \u00b7the standard of proof required.\nIt is often suggested that the right to trial by jury in a civil matter should be abolished. Do you agree? Justify/uni00A0your opinion.The use of a jury of six \npeople is optional in civil trials. The role of the jury is to reach a decision, but it can also determine the level of damages.

Financial disadvantage or one party appearing without representation, may contribute to an unfair decision.\nWHAT CONTROL  DO \nPARTIES\u00a0HAVE?\nInitiate the case\nThe parties are responsible for initiating the case. In a civil case, it is up to the \nindividual parties involved to determine whether the case should go to court. \nThe plaintiff will initiate the case by the issue of a writ or summons (depending on which court is to hear the case). The individual parties are also responsible for completing the pleadings and discovery stages. These steps ensure that the\u00a0parties are properly prepared before the court hearing.\nDecide the facts and issues\nIn a civil case, the parties decide on the relevant points of law to be considered by the court and the relevant facts at issue. In presenting their cases, each party decides which arguments they intend to rely on and selects the evidence that supports these arguments. In a civil case, the parties may disclose their arguments and the evidence they intend to rely on during the pre-trial stages. Parties must decide if they intend to disclose any evidence and when such disclosures should take place.\nRole in determining the time, place and mode of trial\nThe parties also have a role in determining the time and place of the trial. In a civil \ncase, the plaintiff may nominate the court. If the case is to be heard in the County Court or the Supreme Court they can choose to have the case heard by a judge, ora judge and jury .\nPresenting their case in court\nThe parties are responsible for presenting their case in court. In most instances, \nthe individual will engage a legal representative to prepare and present their case. A court case often appears, therefore, as a contest between two lawyers. The individual parties have responsibility for arranging and paying for legal representation.\nIs legal representation necessary?\nIn civil cases, an individual has a right to appear in court and tribunals unrepresented. Litigants may be unable to afford a lawyer, or may not be able to fi  nd a lawyer to represent them or may choose to represent themselves in court. However, evidence suggests that if a person does not hire a lawyer to represent their case, they may be disadvantaged. The majority of unrepresented litigants appear in the civil jurisdiction. Courts in the Victorian court hierarchy have rules to help litigants navigate the civil administrative procedures. The courts help self-represented litigants prepare for court, fi  le documents and understand court procedure. In 2014\u201315, a total of 1665 applications were made in the Probate Court of the Supreme Court by self-represented litigants.

But it is not easy.\nThey have to pit themselves against the complexities of our adversarial legal \nsystem, procedural barriers such as legal terms and court rules, and possibly against solicitors and barristers, obey the instructions of magistrates and judges, and seek the help of court o\ufb03   cers. Judges may be required to spend more time conducting a hearing because of the lack of legal knowledge of the litigant. The judge or magistrate has a duty to tell the self-representing litigant their rights but will not give tactical advice.\nTo help self-represented litigants, the Victorian County Court has a self-\nrepresented litigants\u2019 coordinator and an instructive video, explaining matters such as who the plainti\ufb00   and defendant are, how to prepare the case, what the expectation is, and court rules. A booklet is also available.\nWhen taking on a civil case, the losing party is usually ordered to pay the costs \nof the winning party, which may be more than the amount in dispute.\nThe High Court has provided general advice to courts dealing with \nunrepresented litigants: \u2018There is no limited category of matters regarding which a judge must advise an unrepresented accused \u2013 the judge must give an unrepresented accused such information as is necessary to enable him to have a fair trial.\u2019\nThe High Court recognised the problem of self-representation in the joint \nstatement of Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson and McHugh JJ in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 at [25]\u2013[26]: \u2018A frequent consequence of self-representation is that the court must assume the burden of endeavouring to ascertain the rights of parties which are obfuscated by their own advocacy.\u2019\n5.16  Civil remedies\nSome civil actions involve a matter of principle. For example, in the Balmain Ferry case \nreferred to in \u2018Concepts of civil justice\u2019, Mr Robertson proceeded not because he wanted to recover his penny , but on a matter of principle. Similarly , actions such as defamation, trespass or nuisance may not actually result in substantial injury , damage or loss (fi  nancial or otherwise) to the plaintiff.\nHowever, in most cases, the plaintiff may have suffered considerable hardship due \nto the civil wrong. The aim of civil remedies is to restore the parties to their position before the wrong. A common remedy is an award of damages. In some cases, the court may make an order requiring the defendant to do or refrain from doing something. The plaintiff will specify the type of remedy and the amount sought in the statement of claim. It is also possible to obtain an equitable remedy , such as an injunction or an order of specifi  c\u00a0performance. 196  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 205": "Damages\nThe most common remedy for any civil action is an award of damages. The court \ngenerally orders the defendant to pay a sum of money to restore the plaintiff to their \noriginal position by providing compensation for the injury or damage suffered. The amount awarded will largely depend on the sum claimed by the plaintiff and the jurisdiction of the court. Damages fall into the following categories.\n\u2022 Compensatory damages: The most common form of damages is an award that attempts to compensate the plaintiff for the injury or damage suffered. Compensatory damages are of two main types:\n -Speci\ufb01  c or special damages: This type of award is made to compensate the plaintiff  for items that can be easily measured in terms of money , such as\u00a0medical and  hospital expenses and loss of income. \n -General damages: It is diffi  cult to accurately determine the cost of pain, suffering and loss of enjoyment of life. General damages are calculated according to the degree that the injury or damage has affected the plaintiff\u2019s lifestyle. For example, a permanent leg injury that requires continued physiotherapy and restricts activity may be said to have a greater effect on a young professional footballer than it would on a retired golfer. The footballer\u2019s entire sporting career may be at risk, while the impact on the golfer may be to lifestyle rather than career. Consequently , the amount of damages awarded to the two would differ, even though\u00a0the nature of the injuries may be similar.\n\u2022 Exemplary damages: Sometimes the court may intend to make the defendant an example to the rest of the community . In such cases, the defendant may be ordered to pay a large amount of money , either to punish them or to deter others from acting in the same way .\n\u2022 Nominal damages: In some instances the plaintiff may not have suffered any signifi  cant injury , loss or damage. The principle of the matter is more important than the amount of compensation required. In such cases, the court may order the defendant to pay nominal damages to the plaintiff. Nominal damages are awarded to reinforce the legal interest of the plaintiff.\n\u2022 Contemptuous damages: In some cases the plaintiff may have a valid claim and may even be successful in exercising such rights. However, the court may not be particularly sympathetic. Consequently , the plaintiff may be awarded an amount that\u00a0may seem to make a mockery of the court action.\nNEWSREPORT  5.14\nFootballer compensated for knee injury\nJUNIOR FOOTBALLER BEAU HART WAS 17 WHEN HE INJURED HIS KNEE  \nwhen taking a mark.

  "Page 206": "ARE THERE ANY LIMITS \nON\u00a0DAMAGES ?\nThe Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) deals with claims for personal injury or wrongful death \nin Victoria. The Act deals with injuries other than transport accidents, workplace injuries or injuries as a result of intentional sexual assault or misconduct.\nThe following provisions of the Wrongs Act apply to injuries that occurred on or \nafter 21 May 2003, or where proceedings were commenced on or after 1 October 2003. According to the Act, personal injuries can take the form of:\n \u00b7loss of earnings and future earning capacity \u2013 however, a court will disregard any amount of the plaintiff\u2019s gross weekly earnings that exceeds three times the average weekly earnings\n \u00b7the maximum amount of damages for non-economic loss was increased in 2015 to $577,050\n \u00b7damages for pain and suffering, although they are only recoverable where a plaintiff has suffered a \u2018signifi  cant injury\u2019. The minimum level for recovery of damages is:\n - an impairment of 5% for non-psychiatric injury , as set out in the American \nMedical Association Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment\n - an impairment of 10% for a psychiatric injury , as set out in the Clinical \nGuidelines to the Rating of Psychiatric Impairment, arising from the loss of a child due to an injury to the mother or the foetus or the child before, during or immediately after the birth; or the injury is the loss of a breast.\nInjunctions\nIn certain circumstances, an award of damages is inappropriate, as the plaintiff is trying \nto prevent the defendant doing something or force the defendant to do something. An injunction is an order awarded against the losing party in a civil action that commands or prohibits certain behaviour.\nWhen an injunction orders the defendant to perform some action \u2013 such as fulfi  lling the \nterms of a contract \u2013 this is known as a mandatory or compulsive injunction. Injunctions can be temporary or ongoing. An injunction that is temporary is known as an interlocutory , provisional or interim injunction. These injunctions are issued before a case has been fi  nally decided, to prevent a party from continuing an action before or during the court hearing. Injunctions that have an ongoing effect are referred to as perpetual injunctions.\nDo civil remedies achieve their purpose?\nDamages Injunctions\n \u00b7Damages are effective in cases involving economic loss, \nparticularly cases where the speci/f_i  c value of the damage can be/uni00A0clearly identi/f_i  ed, such as a debt owing or loss of wages.\n \u00b7It may be possible to measure economic loss for a loss such as wages, but determining the level of damages for loss of future earnings is much more dif/f_i  cult to calculate.\n \u00b7The ability of damages to restore the plaintiff to their original position depends on the nature of the damage suffered. For instance, in the case of the loss of a limb, the loss of a loved one or stress and anxiety it may be dif/f_i  cult to calculate a monetary value \u2013 nothing will restore the plaintiff to their original position.\n \u00b7In some instances Acts of Parliament, such as the Wrongs Act, place restrictions on the amounts that can be awarded. This may mean that the plaintiff is not fully compensated for the damage/uni00A0suffered.\n \u00b7Taking a case to court can be a very time-consuming, stressful and costly process. Damages cannot compensate for these factors. \u00b7An injunction can restore a plaintiff to their original position by ordering the defendant to ful/f_i  l an obligation, such as perform their part of a contract.\n \u00b7Where the actions of the defendant have already caused damage, an injunction will not restore the plaintiff but it can stop any further damage.\n \u00b7The effectiveness of an injunction may depend on the willingness of a defendant to comply with the injunction.An injunction is a court \norder that requires the defendant to do something or to refrain from doing something. 198  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

In such a case the court can grant an order for specifi  c performance.\nRestitution\nIf the defendant has property belonging to the plaintiff, the court may make an order of restitution. This compels the defendant to return the property .\nRescission\nIn a dispute involving a contract, a breach of a condition of the contract may result in the court making an order to rescind or cancel the contract.

When C7 lost access to the AFL rights, Austar and Optus stopped using the service and C7 was closed down.\nChannel Seven took legal action, claiming $1.1 billion from several major media \ncompanies for allegedly colluding to prevent C7 buying the AFL and rugby league rights. The Federal Court sat for 120 days and court transcripts amounted to 9530 pages. Justice Sackville dismissed Seven\u2019s $1.1 billion claim in a 1120-page judgment.\nDuring the formal costs hearing, the Federal Court heard argument from PBL, Telstra \nand Optus that they should receive costs backdated due to Seven\u2019s rejection of a formal settlement o\ufb00  er. Documents revealed that PBL had spent $21.5 million, Telstra had spent $20.7 million and Optus had spent $9.2 million.\nSeveral months later three judges of the Full Court of the Federal Court dismissed the \nSeven Network\u2019s appeal. Two judges disagreed with some of the reasoning of Justice Sackville, but this did not change the outcome of the appeal.\nIn the 235-page judgment, the court said the Seven Network had failed to establish \nthat there was any \u2018anti-competitive purpose\u2019 in the business dealings of the respondents in the retail TV market.\n5.18   Evaluating the civil \njustice\u00a0system\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the civil justice system we need to consider the extent to \nwhich these procedures contribute to justice. The critical tests for our justice system are whether it provides for fairness, equality and access.\nNumerous aspects of the civil justice system uphold the key element of justice when \nsettling a dispute. People involved in civil disputes have the right to have that dispute determined by an independent and impartial third person. Civil disputes in our courts are determined by either an independent and impartial judge, or a judge and jury . If the dispute in the Magistrates\u2019 Court is worth less than $10,000 it may be determined by arbitration.

If disputes are \nnot settled reasonably quickly , people may lose respect for the law and take the law into their own hands. Also, unnecessary delays in resolving disputes can result in hardship for individuals and the community .\nCivil pre-trial procedures help speed up the resolution of disputes by allowing the \nparties to clarify issues. This helps the preparation of the case and reduces the time taken for the case to be heard in court. Alternatively , pre-trial procedures may result in the parties reaching an out-of-court settlement and avoiding going to court altogether. Directions hearings allow the courts to monitor the progress of the pre-trial procedures.\nNevertheless, delays in civil cases hinder the timely resolution of disputes. Delays \ncan be due to the actions of the parties, the range of pre-trial procedures that need to be completed, or the workload of the courts.

Alternative dispute resolution methods are relatively cheap and quick.\n\u2022 The legal system provides a range of institutions to resolve disputes: The courts are structured so that more complex cases are heard in the higher courts and minor disputes are heard in lower courts. However, taking a civil dispute to court is\u00a0costly .\n\u2022 The legal system provides for a system of review: In some circumstances individuals who feel that they have not been dealt with fairly may appeal their case to a higher court.

  "Page 210": "Factors limiting justice\nTo be perfectly effective the civil justice system would need to provide access to the law \nto all individuals, regardless of their social, geographic and fi  nancial circumstances. For \nmany individuals, our legal system fails on all fronts. Costs, delays and limited access affect the ability of the civil justice system to achieve justice.\nCosts\nThe costs of initiating civil actions can be prohibitive. These costs include legal advice and representation. Legal advice is often necessary if individuals are to be fully informed of their rights. Legal representation may not be necessary in a minor dispute, but it is necessary if the parties are taking a civil dispute to court. This barrier means that many citizens are denied access to justice, so our justice system is struggling to uphold one of its key elements.\nDelays\nThe time it takes to resolve civil disputes has been an ongoing concern for those seeking \nto improve our civil system of justice. For litigants, the concern may relate to the wait for personal injury compensation. A case may be weakened where witnesses die or forget.\nDelays result in uncertainty and anxiety for all parties. For the courts generally , \ndelays may harm their public reputation as effective institutions and deter individuals from exercising their rights. However, it is important to remember that courts (and other dispute resolution bodies) aim to give a defi  nite answer to important issues between disputing parties. Gathering relevant information, and the consideration of that evidence, may take considerable time.\nThe justice system does have a responsibility to reduce \u2018unacceptable\u2019 and \u2018avoidable\u2019 \ndelays. A number of factors contribute to these sorts of delays, including lengthy pre-trial and trial practices and procedures, insuffi  cient resources (judiciary , court staff, facilities) and lack of court control.\nAccess\nThe principles of justice are underpinned by the assumption that all citizens have equal treatment before the law and equal opportunity to protect their rights by accessing the law . However, the growing demand for legal aid services means that not everyone is able to get the assistance they need. People are missing out on assistance because of where they live, or because they can\u2019t afford a lawyer or because they don\u2019t understand the legal system. This reduces the ability of the civil justice system to dispense justice equally to all. It is not considered fair if some in society are left to represent themselves, or abandon legal action altogether or enter a dispute with an organisation where the power imbalance may result in an unfair outcome.\nCivil pre-trial procedures \nallow for the timely resolution of disputes by ensuring that the parties are fully informed and by encouraging out-of-court settlements.\nCivil trial procedures \nprovide for a fair and unbiased hearing before an independent and impartial third person.

  "Page 211": "  Legal brief 5.2 \nDo delays limit the civil justice system?\nSpeedy justice is highly valued in our legal system. It is often said that \u2018justice delayed \nis justice denied\u2019. Delays detract from the effective operation of the civil justice system.\nWhy are delays a problem?\nDelays can result in injustice to individuals. For example, a plaintiff who has suffered a personal injury can experience hardship if there is a wait for compensation. A litigant\u2019s case may be weakened by delay because witnesses die or forget.\nDelays also increase the period of uncertainty for litigants and lead to unnecessary \nanxieties. Witnesses, including medical practitioners and other experts, incur costs if they have to wait around a court for a long time before being called to give evidence. Delays may also result in general harm to the community through the court not being available to resolve other disputes.\nDelays reduce the general community\u2019s respect for legal processes and procedures. \nThis deters individuals from using the courts to settle disputes. If people are not able to use the courts to settle disputes, the legal system cannot operate effectively.\nBut do quick hearings lead to justice? The legal process needs time in order for things \nto be done properly. A quick resolution could result in a greater injustice. A certain amount of delay is inherent in the system. Court action aims to provide a de/f_i  nite answer to problems. Therefore, it requires careful preparation and consideration.\nThe question is when do delays become excessive and intolerable? At what point does \nthe delay limit the effective operation of the legal system? The answer to these questions seems to be that undue delay occurs when, in the circumstances, the lapse of time is both considerable and not essential to a just resolution of the claim.\nWhat causes delays?\nDelays result from a combination of factors. Some of the reasons for such delays are outlined below. None of these factors alone leads directly to a delay, but all of them contribute to them.\nHow do individuals contribute to delays?\nThe role of the individual in contributing to delays cannot be overlooked. The defendant who seeks legal advice at the last possible moment contributes to delays. They may seek an adjournment so that their case can be properly prepared. The plaintiff who fails to attend a doctor\u2019s appointment for an assessment of their condition may prolong pleadings. Human failings, combined with the problems that exist in the structures of our legal system, contribute to signi/f_i  cant delays.\nHow do lawyers contribute to delays?\nAs in all professions, there are some lawyers who are more ef/f_i  cient and knowledgeable in specialist areas than others. Some lawyers are more in demand than others. The workloads of individual lawyers can have an impact on delays in the courts.\nThere are many steps in the preparation of a court action. Lawyers who have a large \nworkload may need to put off some tasks because of the pressure to have another case ready for court. Solicitors also rely on barristers to draft documents and to give advice in relation to the law affecting their case. Here again there is potential for delay. The barrister is not involved in all the stages of litigation and may take some time to become familiar with the facts. A solicitor may not brief a barrister until just before the hearing. These practices can result in court delays. A deep-pocketed defendant or their insurer may have little commercial motive to resolve claims quickly.\nDelays during the actual hearing of a case may result from either a party\u2019s lack of \npreparation or late amendments to pleadings. The use of directions hearings in the pre-trial stages aims to ensure that the parties are adequately prepared for the court hearing.Delays may be caused \nby individuals, lawyers, the use of juries or the workload of courts.

  "Page 212": "\u00b7In 2017, Practice Notes SC Gen 5: Technology in Civil Litigation, aimed to \u2018promote the\nef\nfective use of technology in the conduct of civil litigation to reduce time and costs\u2019,\nwas introduced. It outlines the expectations of judges, legal practitioners, staff andlitigants in facilitating the just, ef/f_i  cient, timely and cost-effective resolution of disputes.The expectation that all communication will be electronic is in line with the court\u2019soverarching obligation to save time and money. Handling pre-trial processes and trialsonline is now regarded as fundamental to the ef/f_i  cient conduct of a civil/uni00A0trial.\n\u00b7Organising the administration of cases in lists: \u2018Lists\u2019 are managed in the pre-trial stages using the directions hearing pr\nocess; all specialist lists are managed\nby particular judges, with the aim of reducing delays and costs. The Court ofAppeal eliminated the automatic right of appeal \u2013 appeals now require leave, andin many cases leave/uni00A0is decided on the papers. Specialist appeal benches havebeen/uni00A0established: for instance, an insolvency case will have insolvency expert judges.\n\u00b7Increased referral of parties to mediation: Court-annexed mediation, especiallyusing associate judges, is proving effective and bene/f_i  cial to parties, saving time andmoney. For instance, in the Commercial Court it is not unusual, after the plaintiff\u2019scase is opened and the defendant responds, that the judge then refers the matter tocourt-annexed mediation.\nAppoint more judges\nIt is sometimes suggested that the appointment of more judges would help to reduce delays in our court system. The number of judges certainly has an effect on delays. However, the number of judges appointed to the court is not the only factor that determines the amount of \u2018judge time\u2019 in court.\nIncreasing the number of judges in the court would result in considerable expense. \nWhen calculating the costs of employing new judges, we must also consider the cost of their associates, tipstaff, court reporters, registrars and other court of/f_i  cials, as well as the provision of facilities.\nExtend court sitting times\nThe average number of days that a judge sits in court depends on the number of days the courts are open. Apart from public holidays, the courts observe a six-week vacation from just before Christmas and another break for the /f_i  rst fortnight in July. A \u2018vacation judge\u2019 is available to hear urgent matters during these times. One way to reduce delays would be to require the courts to operate during these vacation times.\nHowever, judges argue that they will often work during these times, on tasks such \nas writing reserved judgments. The main cause of delay is the dif/f_i  culty in accurately estimating the amount of judge time needed. If of/f_i  cials knew that a given number of judges would be required at a given time, there would be fewer delays.How do juries contribute to\u00a0delays?\nThe use of juries in civil cases is often cited as a factor contributing to delays and increased costs. Juries are one reason for the use of strict rules of evidence. Lawyers conduct lengthy and detailed examinations of expert witnesses to make sure that the jury understands the/uni00A0evidence.\nHowever, juries are an important \ncomponent of our justice system. They enable community participation in the administration of our justice system. Jury decisions re/f_l  ect prevailing social values. Juries provide a fair and unbiased hearing, as well as the recognition of basic human/uni00A0rights.\nThe use of a jury can contribute to the time taken to hear a case. When a jury is used \nto hear a civil action, the evidence of expert witnesses needs to be carefully and fully explored through examination and cross-examination. As the jury consists of people without legal training, the opening and closing statements are likely to take longer than in a non-jury trial. Generally lawyers will tend to call more witnesses and take longer in examining each witness. Certainly, the use of juries in civil cases contributes signi/f_i  cantly to the costs and time taken in reaching settlement of a claim. The continued use of juries in civil cases has been the subject of considerable debate.\nHow can we reduce delays?\nOne way of reducing delays and costs is to allow the courts greater control. The involvement of courts through the directions hearing process has meant that timelines for the conduct of the pre-trial stages can be established. This has reduced delays in the pre-trial processes.\nOver the past 10 years the Supreme Court of Victoria has introduced a number of \ninitiatives to reduce delays in hearing civil cases. These include:\n\u00b7Increased use of technology: During the Kilmore East bush/f_i  re trial, the Supreme\nCourt made sure that the judge, Justice Jack Forrest, had the use of leading-edgetechnology in a special courtroom with the support of a team facing the lawyers.It was found that almost one-third of the predicted court time was saved by usingtechnology in the courtroom.Delays could be reduced \nby appointing more judges, reducing court workload, delegating some functions to court of/f_i  cials, extending the sitting times of courts and/or imposing time limits on some procedures.\nPAPER-FREE  COURT\nRedCrest is a case management system available \nto Commercial Court users 24 hours a day , 7 days a week. It\u00a0plays a crucial role in facilitating the court\u2019s objectives of becoming paper-free and more service-oriented by providing an easy-to-use platform for electronically fi  ling documents of varying sizes, formats and complexity . It\u00a0also frees up staff from data entry , fi  le management and counter duties to better manage proceedings, ensuring\u00a0that cases are properly prioritised and moved through the court as quickly as possible. The Commercial Court Registry now delivers a paper-free service to its users. The system includes a number of case-management effi  ciencies such as:\n\u00b7ensuring a central, secure and verifi  ablerepository of all documents fi  led in a proceeding\u00b7allowing different levels of access to the fi  le of thejudiciary , judicial support, registry staff and legalpractitioners\n\u00b7providing access for judicial offi  cers andassociates to materials on the court fi  le at alltimes, without having\u00a0to move the fi  le between theregistry and the barristers\u2019 chambers\n\u00b7automated notifi  cations to chambers and partieswhen a new document is fi  led.\nRedCrest\u2019s operation in the Commercial Court is unique because, unlike similar court systems, it allows both practitioners and the court to directly interact with the electronic court fi  le. Some of the defi  ning features of this\u00a0innovation are:\u00b7allowing a user to register a system account andhaving access rights assigned based on their rolein\u00a0the\u00a0proceedings\n\u00b7enabling parties to initiate a case and makepayments without having to leave their desk\n\u00b7facilitating the fi  ling of documents to the court fi  lein real time with email notifi  cations of fi  lings beingautomatically sent to each party\n\u00b7permitting electronic service of documents bythe\u00a0parties.\nThe system currently accepts fi  lings in all judge-managed matters in the General Commercial, Corporations, Intellectual Property , and Technology , Engineering and Construction lists. About 750 proceedings are now managed in RedCrest. These include the Timbercorp and Great Southern debt recovery proceedings, which accounted for approximately 500 of the cases fi  led to 30 June\u00a02015. RedCrest has over 1200 registered users, of whom approximately 1100 are external to the court. More than 6500 documents have been accepted for fi  ling. The\u00a0court is committed to the continued improvement of all its systems and processes and has actively encouraged and welcomed feedback from users about\u00a0RedCrest\u2019s functionality .

  "Page 213": " \u00b7In 2017, Practice Notes SC Gen 5: Technology in Civil Litigation, aimed to \u2018promote the \neffective use of technology in the conduct of civil litigation to reduce time and costs\u2019, was introduced. It outlines the expectations of judges, legal practitioners, staff and litigants in facilitating the just, ef/f_i  cient, timely and cost-effective resolution of disputes. The expectation that all communication will be electronic is in line with the court\u2019s overarching obligation to save time and money. Handling pre-trial processes and trials online is now regarded as fundamental to the ef/f_i  cient conduct of a civil/uni00A0trial.\n \u00b7Organising the administration of cases in lists: \u2018Lists\u2019 are managed in the pre-trial stages using the directions hearing process; all specialist lists are managed by particular judges, with the aim of reducing delays and costs. The Court of Appeal eliminated the automatic right of appeal \u2013 appeals now require leave, and in many cases leave/uni00A0is decided on the papers. Specialist appeal benches have been/uni00A0established: for instance, an insolvency case will have insolvency expert judges.\n \u00b7Increased referral of parties to mediation: Court-annexed mediation, especially using associate judges, is proving effective and bene/f_i  cial to parties, saving time and money. For instance, in the Commercial Court it is not unusual, after the plaintiff\u2019s case is opened and the defendant responds, that the judge then refers the matter to court-annexed mediation.\nAppoint more judges\nIt is sometimes suggested that the appointment of more judges would help to reduce delays in our court system. The number of judges certainly has an effect on delays. However, the number of judges appointed to the court is not the only factor that determines the amount of \u2018judge time\u2019 in court.\nIncreasing the number of judges in the court would result in considerable expense. \nWhen calculating the costs of employing new judges, we must also consider the cost of their associates, tipstaff, court reporters, registrars and other court of/f_i  cials, as well as the provision of facilities.\nExtend court sitting times\nThe average number of days that a judge sits in court depends on the number of days the courts are open. Apart from public holidays, the courts observe a six-week vacation from just before Christmas and another break for the /f_i  rst fortnight in July. A \u2018vacation judge\u2019 is available to hear urgent matters during these times. One way to reduce delays would be to require the courts to operate during these vacation times.\nHowever, judges argue that they will often work during these times, on tasks such \nas writing reserved judgments.

  "Page 214": "  Legal Brief 5.3\nDo costs limit the civil justice system?\nWhy are costs a problem?\nThe costs of taking a civil action are high and increasing. This can deter individuals from \nexercising their rights and therefore limit their access to dispute resolution. If individuals are not able to exercise their rights, the civil justice system cannot operate effectively.\nWho can afford a civil case?\nA recent study found that most actions involving claims for damages for personal injuries are brought by ordinary people in the community. These people are neither very rich nor very poor. This may be partly due to the growth in the practice of solicitors acting on alternative fee arrangements. Solicitors acting on such arrangements are willing to take the work on the basis that if the case is lost they will not expect to recover their fees. The success rate of such cases is high. However, the situation in relation to commercial claims is different. Most plaintiffs in these actions fall into the \u2018very rich\u2019 category. In practice, many of these plaintiffs are corporations.\nWhat effect do pre-trial procedures have on costs?\nRecent attempts to increase access to justice have seen an increase in judicial management/uni00A0of cases. This includes the use of directions hearings. However, directions hearings can add to the costs of justice. When a lawyer attends a direction hearing the \u2018meter is on\u2019. Furthermore, the practice of charging on the basis of time spent rewards delay and inef/f_i  ciency. Changing the system of charging for legal services may result in a more ef/f_i  cient system of litigation.\nWhat impact does self-representation have on costs?\nA self-represented litigant is a person who does not have legal representation. A self- represented litigant imposes additional work on the courts. The civil justice system operates on the presumption that lawyers will represent parties in court. Individuals representing themselves are less likely to be adequately informed or prepared. They may lack knowledge of court procedures, they may not understand the law and legal terminology and they often will not have the skills to present their case, but if court of/f_i  cials or judges help them, the system is vulnerable to claims of bias.\nWhen one party has no legal representation it may increase the costs for all parties \ninvolved. A self-represented litigant may require more pre-trial procedures. The issues in the cases may be poorly de/f_i  ned and require further clari/f_i  cation. There may be more time and expense spent in responding to unclear or irrelevant evidence.\nWhat is the cost to the community?\nThere are too many civil cases that take longer than is really needed to reach a resolution. These cases consume more public and private resources than is desirable. Longer cases result in delays in the court system and the need for increased court services.\nIf the cost of litigation is too great, the integrity of our civil justice system as a whole \nwill suffer. The public will see the system as ineffective and seek other means to resolve their disputes.\nHow can we reduce costs?\nOur methods of trying civil cases need to change. Changes should aim at reducing the costs to the parties in a civil action. Saving costs to litigants would also save costs for the community.\nDispute resolution methods\nIn recent years, the use of alternative dispute resolution methods (also referred to as appropriate dispute resolution methods) has been encouraged. People in a civil dispute are free to choose the kind of dispute resolution they want to use. Courts should keep encouraging the use of other methods by providing for them within the court system. In addition, there is a range of civil matters that can be dealt with by tribunals. These tribunals use other dispute resolution methods and parties frequently do not require legal representation.Costs can deter people \nfrom accessing dispute resolution.\nCosts include the cost of legal assistance, the cost of running pre-trial procedures and costs associated with self-represented people.\nThe impact of costs could be reduced by the use of other dispute resolution methods, providing legal insurance, the use of contingency fees and increasing access to legal assistance. 206  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 215": "CostsCosts associated with\nself-represented litigants\nThere are a number of reasons why a person \nmay go to court without a lawyer. The \nincreased number of people going to court \nwithout legal representation in the civil courts \nhas implications for the effectiveness, \nef/f_iciency and fairness of the justice system. \nThis can add to the costs for both parties.Costs of pre-trial \nprocedures\nExtensive pre-trial \nprocedures \ncontribute to the \ncosts associated \nwith taking a civil \ndispute to court. \nCourt fees can \ndiscourage people \nfrom taking a case \nto court.\nCosts of legal assistance\nIt is often suggested that only people who are very \nrich, or who are very poor and can therefore obtain \nlegal aid, are able to take legal action. The very rich \nhave always been able to sue. Over the past decade \nthe legal aid budget has been spent mostly on \npeople charged with criminal offences. Little, if any, \nof the legal aid budget is available for civil cases.\nLegal insurance\nIt has been suggested that one way to improve access to justice would be to introduce \na system, similar to that in Germany, of publicly funded legal insurance. This would guarantee that all people could afford to take legal action. But what would be the consequences for the court system? The number of judges per head of population in Germany is greater than the number in Australia. Would it be possible to increase access to justice and allow more people to go to court without increasing the number of courts and judges? Would it be worth increasing the numbers if the result was more ef/f_i  cient and effective use of our legal processes?\nThe use of funding arrangements\nBoth lawyers and litigation funding companies can provide support for a client to bring their case. However, support provided by a lawyer is different from funding provided by a litigation funder company. Litigation funder companies charge a fee which is a share of the amount awarded by the court to the plaintiff. Lawyers are prohibited from using this type of charging arrangement.\nThe introduction of litigation funder agreements may increase the capacity of individuals \nto exercise their rights through the courts. Litigation funders provide security for costs and agree to pay any adverse costs ordered by the court. The funder is paid a share of the amount recovered and is not paid if the case is unsuccessful. It has been suggested that the use of litigation funder arrangements could increase access to justice.\nIn 2017 the Victorian Law Reform Commission began an inquiry into litigation funding \nand group proceedings. The Commission was asked to report on:\n\u00b7the supervision of litigation funders, including clear disclosure requirements, limits\non the success fees that can be charged by a litigation funder to plaintiffs when adecision or settlement results in a payment to the plaintiffs by a defendant, andobligations to disclose funding arrangements\n\u00b7whether the existing prohibition on law /f_i  rms charging contingency fees would helpmitigate the issues presented by the practice of litigation funding.

  "Page 216": "Conditional billing arrangements\nSome /f_i  rms offer a \u2018no win, no fee\u2019 approach, also known as conditional billing. The law \n/f_i  rm Slater & Gordon pioneered this approach in Victoria in 1994, and has taken out a trademark on their No Win \u2013 No Fee\u2122 scheme. The scheme was introduced in response to growing community concern about access to justice. The No Win \u2013 No Fee arrangement provides that if a claim is not successful, the plaintiff is not required to pay any legal fees to the /f_i  rm. However, the plaintiff may still be required to pay \u2018disbursements\u2019 (costs such as court costs or witness expenses that a legal representative has to pay and so should reasonably expect to be reimbursed for) and bears the risk of paying the other party\u2019s costs if they are unsuccessful in their claim. If the claim is successful the plaintiff is charged legal fees. These fees may include an \u2018uplift\u2019 (or success) fee. In Victoria, an uplift fee of up to 25% is allowed. Conditional billing is most commonly used in personal injury, workers\u2019 compensation, wills disputes and defamation cases.\nIntroduction of electronic case management\nIn Australia, large law /f_i  rms have been involved in eDiscovery, or electronic case management, for some time. eDiscovery \u2013 \u2018electronic discovery\u2019 \u2013 refers to the process of collecting and processing material for use in civil litigation electronically. The Supreme Court Practice Notes require the use of electronic documents to reduce costs.\nPrinciple Assumptions\nDealings in hard copy are to be the exception rather \nthan the rule in all aspects of civil litigation in the court. Converting Electronic Documents into hard copy requires justi/f_i  cation. Communications and dealings in modern society are predominantly conducted electronically. A large number of discoverable documents are stored by parties electronically.\nThe inability or reluctance of a lawyer to use common technologies should not mean additional costs for other parties.\nSourcing technology services through a third-party \nprovider is accepted practice. The use of common technologies is a core skill for lawyers and a basic component of all/uni00A0legal practice, whether provided in house or through a third-party provider. \nWherever possible, parties are to exchange documents in a useable, searchable format or in the format in which the documents are ordinarily maintained. The exchange format should allow the party receiving the documents the same ability to access, search, review and display the documents as the party producing the documents. Documents in electronic form offer greater functionality and ef/f_i  ciency in dealing with information. \nAn unreasonable failure to cooperate in the use of technology which occasions additional costs will constitute a breach of the overarching obligations of the parties. Cooperation between the parties in the use of technology reduces costs. \nParties should be prepared to address the court on the use of technology at an early stage of a proceeding. The early and consistent use of technology in a proceeding may produce ef/f_i  ciencies for/uni00A0both the parties and the court. \nThe increased capacity to store, search and access a large volume of documents through the use of technology does not relieve parties of the obligation to limit the presentation of documentary evidence to that which is necessary and proportionate to the conduct of the case. Parties will re/f_i  ne the documents to be presented to the court to those which are necessary for the conduct of the proceeding. \nIncrease access to legal assistance\nLimitations in legal aid funding and the need to help people access the legal system \nwhen they don\u2019t have legal representation has resulted in a number of changes. Legal Aid recommendations to improve access to justice include:\n\u00b7Extra investment from State and Federal governments: Additional funds would allow\nmore services, which would meet the needs of broader groups of people. VictorianLegal Aid called for a further investment of almost $72 million per year from Federaland State governments.\n\u00b7Expand key services: The self-help website and Legal Help phone line offer adviceand referral information in 20 languages. Improvement in this service would greatlyenhance access for individuals seeking assistance to deal with civil issues.\n\u00b7Lower the eligibility criteria to ensure that more people qualify for assistance: Themeans-test criterion means that services are only available to the most disadvantagedand vulnerable groups. The eligibility criteria need to realistically re/f_l  ect the level ofdisadvantage and the cost of legal assistance.

It proposed \nfour key strategies:\n1 Better information: Improve systems that provide \nlegal information to the public. This would assist people who are not eligible for assistance but are unable to afford help. Access to relevant information for the \u2018missing middle\u2019 would empower them to solve the issue. It was recommended that Victoria Legal Aid be the central entry point for Victorians seeking legal advice.\n2 More \ufb02  exible and integrated services: The report recommended a system that catered for a variety of people and problems, at the right time and at the right place. Providing accessible information and dispute resolution processes that are appropriate would help the \u2018middle group\u2019 resolve their claims. The recommendation supports a \u2018no wrong door\u2019 approach, so that people get the advice they need when they need it.\n3 Better use of technology: The report acknowledged the changing expectations the public has around accessing information on mobile devices outside regular business hours. It was recommended that complaint bodies, tribunals and courts make better use of different technological platforms to access and be accessed by the community . For example, an online tool that connects pro bono legal practitioners to Community Legal Centres would improve the public\u2019s access to information and dispute settlement.\n4 Stronger leadership, governance and linkages: Despite ongoing improvements in this area, it was recommended that better communication and more sharing of experience and expertise (in areas such as ADR and self-representation) would improve the\u00a0effi  cient delivery of justice.\nOther key recommendations included:\n \u00b7widening the use of alternative dispute resolution\n \u00b7improving VLA services for disadvantaged and vulnerable\u00a0groups\n \u00b7improving access to the VCAT small claims list (online\u00a0dispute\u00a0resolution)\n \u00b7assisting self-represented Victorians\n \u00b7improving pro bono services.\nLegal information and educationLegal advice\nEnquiries \u2013 Assisted legal informationDispute resolution assistanceCourts\nand tribunalsTriage available during all servicesLegal representation(e.g. in court)Intensity of service\nProportion of community who access services Chapter 5  Civil law and/uni00A0justice 209\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

She said that without additional funds, judges would continue to be faced with deciding what contact orders to put in place between parents and children, or whether contact should be cut altogether, in situations where they do not have the time or the information to be sure their decisions are the best possible ones. 210  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

Like most countries colonised \nby Great Britain, Australia adopted the basic structure of the British parliamentary system. \nThis is known as the Westminster system, named after Westminster Palace in London, where the British parliament sits.\nUpper house Lower house\nFigure 6.1 Bicameral parliament \nThe Westminster system of parliament consists of two houses and the sovereign. \nA\u00a0parliament that consists of two houses is known as a bicameral parliament.

The Crown retains the right to accept or\u00a0refuse proposals passed by both houses of parliament. However, the usual practice\u00a0is\u00a0that\u00a0the Crown accepts laws passed by parliament.\n6.2  Parliament in Australia\nBoth the Commonwealth and Victorian parliaments are based on the Westminster system. The structure of Australia\u2019s Commonwealth parliament is formally set out in the\u00a0Commonwealth Constitution.\nBefore Federation\nWAS AUSTRALIA AN \nEMPTY\u00a0LAND ?\nWhen the British colonised Australia they brought with them the English legal \nsystem. They did not recognise the existence of an Indigenous legal system or the land rights of the Indigenous people. At that time, Australia was considered to be a terra nullius \u2013 in other words, Australia was considered an empty land. It was not until 3 June 1992, in the famous Mabo case (Mabo and Others v Queensland (No./uni00A02) (1902) 175 CLR 1; [1992] HCA 23), that our courts recognised native title, or\u00a0ownership of land.\nAustralia was \ufb01  rst colonised as a convict colony . These convicts were released after \nserving their time as prisoners and settled in various parts of the country . Free settlers also arrived and began industries and trade. These settlers wanted representative and responsible government in the form of a Westminster-style parliament.\nThis was granted by the British parliament passing a Constitution for each of the \ncolonies (today\u2019s States). These constitutions meant that each colony had a parliament with limited law-making powers. Each colony could make its own laws and had its own courts. These courts could hear and determine disputes concerning British laws and laws made by the colony .Australia adopted the \nWestminster system from/uni00A0Great Britain.\nIn the Westminster system, parliament consists of two houses and the Crown.\nBefore Federation, each colony had its own/uni00A0parliament. 218  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

Each colony also wanted to retain the power to govern in its own territory . A federal political system that would balance these interests had to be designed. Some powers had to be set aside for a central authority . Other powers had to be reserved for the colonies.\nWHAT IS A FEDERAL SYSTEM ?\nAustralia has a federal system of government. Under this federal system, the \ncountry is divided into States. Each State has its own parliament, which can exercise powers relating to certain issues, such as transport, power, water and education. In a federation, the people of the States agree that speci\ufb01  ed matters are more effectively handled by a national authority than a State body . Therefore the central authority \u2013 the parliament of Australia \u2013 has the power to make laws about matters that would affect the whole country , such as defence, currency , trade and postal\u00a0services.\nVoting for Federation\nFigure 6.2 Federation Referendum Certi/f_i  cate  Chapter 6  The Australian parliamentary system 219\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

The Australian Constitution sets out the structure of the \nCommonwealth parliament and its powers to make laws. It de\ufb01  nes the relationship between the Commonwealth parliament and the State parliaments. It establishes that the Commonwealth parliament has a House of Representatives (lower house) and a Senate\u00a0(upper house).\nThe Constitution also established the High Court as the highest Australian court of \nappeal. When the Constitution came into force, the colonies became known as States. The\u00a0States had their own parliaments with some of the law-making powers that they exercised as colonies.\nBetween 1901 and 1986, the historical in\ufb02  uence of the British legal system on the \nAustralian parliaments and the courts slowly ended. In 1986 the Australia Acts cut the last \nlinks between Great Britain and the States. These nearly identical Acts were enacted by the British and Australian parliaments, and they came into force on the same date. The Australia Acts established the Australian High Court as the \ufb01  nal court of appeal.\nThe Australian Constitution sets out the three main functions of government:\n\u2022 the legislative function, including the structure of the Commonwealth parliament\nand its law-making powers\n\u2022 the executive (administration) function of government, which includes establishing\nthe Executive Council (the ministers and parliamentary secretaries)\n\u2022 the judicial function, including establishing the High Court.\nOUTLINE  OF THE \nCOMMONWEALTH \nCONSTITUTION\nLegislative \nfunctionChapter I sets out the structure and powers of the Commonwealth parliament.

It consists of 150 members. For the forty-sixth federal election it is proposed that the number of members in the House of Representatives be increased to\u00a0151. This change will re\ufb02  ect the growth in population.\nMembers of the House of Representatives are elected to represent areas called \nelectorates. Each electorate is an area with approximately the same number of voters. Voters directly elect one member for their electorate in elections held every 3 years. Members are responsible to the electorate and represent the interests of the people in their electorate.\nThe House of Representatives is designed to represent the interests of the majority \nof people in Australia. For this reason it is sometimes referred to as the \u2018people\u2019s house\u2019. The\u00a0House of Representatives also plays an important role in the formation of government. The political party that wins a majority of seats in the House of Representatives forms government. For this reason it is sometimes referred to as the \u2018house of government\u2019.\nHOW MANY REPRESENTATIVES ?\nThe number of representatives from any State varies according to the population of the State. The Constitution \nallows parliament to increase or decrease the total number of members in the House of Representatives. This is to meet the requirement that the number of members shall be as near as practicable to twice the number in the Senate. The Constitution also states that no State shall have fewer than \ufb01  ve representatives.\nThe role of the House of Representatives\nThe main function of the House of Representatives is to make laws. It shares this function \nwith the Senate. A Bill (a proposed new law) must be passed by both the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate before it can become law (it is then called an Act). Any member of the House of Representatives can introduce a proposal for a new law . However, most Bills come from members of the government. To become a law , the Bill must receive the approval of both houses of parliament and royal assent. It can be amended by both houses of parliament. For more \ninformation on \nthe parliament of Australia, go to www.aph.gov.au.\nThe House of Representatives is the lower house, and represents the interests of the majority of people.\nThe role of the House of Representatives includes making laws, representing the majority and forming government.

  "Page 230": "Other key roles of the House of Representatives include:\n\u2022 Determining government: The party , or parties in coalition, with a majority in the \nlower house forms government. To remain in government, the party must maintain the support of the majority of members in the lower house.\n\u2022 Providing for representative government: Members of the House of Representatives are elected to represent areas of approximately the same number of electors. The electoral system ensures that the House of Representatives represents the interests of the majority of voters.\n\u2022 Providing for responsible government: Individual members of the House of Representatives have the opportunity to present the views of their electorate by presenting petitions or raising issues with ministers during Question Time.\n\u2022 Scrutinising government: The House of Representatives plays an important role in providing for responsible government. In the House of Representatives, legislation is debated, ministers make policy statements, matters of public importance are discussed, and ministers are questioned during Question Time.\n\u2022 Controlling government spending: The government can only collect taxes or allocate the spending of public money if a law is passed by parliament.\nFigure 6.4 House of Representatives\nThe Senate\nThe Senate consists of 76 members. Each State elects 12 representatives and each \nTerritory elects two. This system guarantees equal representation for each State irrespective of its population. The Commonwealth Constitution maintains a balance of numbers between the lower house and the upper house by ensuring that the lower house has roughly double the number of members of the upper house.\nThe Senate is directly elected by all Australians who qualify to vote. Voting is conducted \naccording to the proportional representation system: groups and independent candidates are elected to the parliament in proportion to the number of votes they receive. With the exception of \ufb01  nancial Bills, the Senate has powers equal to those of the House of Representatives.The Senate is the upper \nhouse.

  "Page 231": "Senators are elected for a term of 6 years. Half the Senate retires every 3 years. \nWhenever possible, these elections are held at the same time as the election for the \nHouse of Representatives. All members of the House of Representatives must be elected every 3 years. The Senate therefore provides stability as well as ongoing membership.\nThe role of the Senate\nThe Senate shares a role in law-making with the House of Representatives. A Bill must be \npassed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives to become a law . Most Bills are proposed by the government and start in the House of Representatives, but new laws can also start in the Senate.\nOther key functions of the Senate include:\n\u2022 Reviewing laws: The Senate provides for the review of legislation passed by \nthe\u00a0House of Representatives. Historically , the upper house has the responsibility to check legislation passed by the lower house. For this reason the Senate is sometimes referred to as the \u2018house of review\u2019. The Senate can originate, amend or\u00a0reject any proposed law .\n\u2022 Providing for representative government: A function of the Senate is to safeguard the interests of the States. As each State elects an equal number of senators, the Senate provides for equal representation among the States. For this reason the Senate is sometimes called the \u2018States\u2019 house\u2019.\n\u2022 Providing for responsible government: The party , or parties in coalition, with a majority in the House of Representatives does not need a majority in the Senate to form government. When the Senate is not composed of a majority of senators from the party or parties forming government it can exert considerable in\ufb02  uence on the government and make it account for its actions and proposals. Individual senators also have the opportunity to present petitions and to raise issues during Question\u00a0Time.\n\u2022 Scrutinising government: Like the House of Representatives, the Senate has responsibility for supervising administrative laws, protecting the rights of citizens, presenting con\ufb02  icting views in open debate, and gathering and disseminating information. When the government does not hold a majority of seats in the Senate, the Senate can question government actions very effectively .\nFigure 6.5 The SenateThe role of the Senate \nincludes making laws, reviewing laws and representing the interests of the States.

In/uni00A01901, \nthe /f_i  rst year of the Commonwealth of Australia, parliament passed 17 laws. That year, parliament passed an Act every 16 or 17/uni00A0days. In its /f_i  rst 10 years, it averaged about 23 laws a year. In 1952, the parliament passed more than 100 Acts. Now the House of Representatives spends, on average, only 2/uni00A0or 3 hours on each Bill/uni00A0it considers.\nWith this pressure on parliaments, the existence of the \nSenate is sometimes questioned. This usually happens when legislation is being blocked in the upper house, frustrating the government. When this situation occurs, there are often public debates about the e\ufb00  ectiveness of the Senate and the cost of having a second chamber.\nOther crucial roles of the Senate\nThe writers of the Constitution believed that the primary role of the Senate was to protect the interests of the less populous States by giving representation to all States. It has virtually equal power with the House of Representatives to make laws. Although the government is formed by the party, or coalition of parties, with a majority in the House of Representatives, they do not have to hold a majority of seats in the Senate. The upper house can therefore force the government to account for its actions. The Senate can withhold /f_i  nance by rejecting the money Bills, which impose tax or appropriate revenue in other ways.\nThe Senate keeps a check on government by \nscrutinising Bills, delegated legislation (laws made by subordinate authorities) and government administration. This is done through procedures (such as Question Time) in the Senate chamber, and through the operation of the Senate committee system.\nStrengths of the Senate\nThe Senate has a number of strengths. Besides the power to veto legislation, the Senate:\n\u2022 forms an integral part of the doctrine of the \nseparation of powers. The Senate provides for checks/uni00A0and balances on the power of the executive. It/uni00A0can make the government accountable and expose/uni00A0misconduct.\n\u2022 reviews legislation to improve Bills with amendments \nor to defeat what it considers unwise legislation\n\u2022 has been mostly outside the control of the \ngovernment of the day, be it Liberal/National or Labor: the government of the day often does not have a majority in the Senate\u2022 provides a broader sense of representation: \nresidents/uni00A0of small States and supporters of opposition/uni00A0parties receive better representation (in the sense of having a higher number of representatives) in the Senate than in the House of/uni00A0Representatives\n\u2022 allows for input from small parties by providing \nopportunities for them to discuss their ideas for new policies: small party representation helps foster/uni00A0respect for the diversity of the Australian/uni00A0community\n\u2022 has a committee process that allows time for \ndetailed/uni00A0study of issues\n\u2022 allows citizens to express their views to parliament \nthrough the presentation of petitions: this function can be more e\ufb00  ective in the Senate than in the House of Representatives, because it is more likely that minor parties are represented there and the committee system is better developed\n\u2022 sits for longer and devotes more time to \nindividual pieces of legislation than the House of Representatives: it is likely to consider more amendments from senators representing minor/uni00A0parties.\nWeaknesses of the Senate\nThe Senate is not a perfect institution. Its weaknesses/uni00A0include:\n\u2022 senators vote according to party policies \u2013 this \nmay override the original function of the Senate to/uni00A0represent the interests of the States\n\u2022 empowering small parties \u2013 such as the Greens \u2013 \nwho may e\ufb00  ectively have the power to veto laws supported by the majority party in the lower house\n\u2022 the disproportionate representation of small States \nand Territories: Tasmania, with a relatively small population, has 12 senators, but the ACT and Northern Territory each have only 2 senators \u2013 in 2010, the 12 senators from NSW represented about 4,591,748 voters, while the 12 Tasmanian senators represented 357,873 voters. There are also questions around the cost of providing such representation.\n\u2022 6-year terms can insulate senators from the full \nimpact of changes in the views of the electorate, and/uni00A0may thus diminish the degree to which senators/uni00A0are responsive to the electorate. 224 Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

Australians were asked to vote on whether Australia should become a republic. The referendum proposal was not\u00a0successful.Ten years later the republic debate was raised \nagain. In 2009 a Senate committee investigated a proposal for a plebiscite referendum on the issue.

At a State level, the Premier is selected in a similar manner.\nWhat is a minister?\nThe Prime Minister recommends other members of the majority party (or parties in coalition) to the Governor-General to be appointed as ministers of state.\nA minister is responsible and answerable to parliament \nfor the actions of a government department. (For example, the Minister for Resources, Energy and Tourism is responsible for the Department or Departments of Resources, Energy and Tourism.) A minister must be a member of parliament; they may be a member of either the House of Representatives or the Senate. Each minister has a portfolio. A portfolio is a special area of/uni00A0responsibility.\nThe minister is responsible to the Governor-General, \nthe Prime Minister and to the members of both houses. Ministers can be asked to answer questions on all aspects of the departments for which they are accountable. This is a key feature of responsible government. At a State level, ministers are responsible to the Governor, the Premier and the State parliament.\nWhat is Cabinet?\nCabinet is a meeting of ministers. Members of Cabinet form the Executive Council. Most members of Cabinet are ministers \u2018with portfolio\u2019. This means that they are in charge of government departments. The members of Cabinet determine the general policy of the government. Most Bills are approved by Cabinet before they are presented to the parliament.\nThe way Cabinet works is not set out in the \nConstitution./uni00A0 Cabinet operates according to practices inherited from the Westminster system, which are designed to re/f_l  ect the principles of responsible government. They include:\n \u00b7The Governor-General will act on the advice given by ministers in Cabinet (the Executive Council).\n \u00b7Ministers who are members of Cabinet come from the party that has a majority in the House of Representatives.\n \u00b7Ministers are expected to resign if their house of parliament passes a motion of no con/f_i  dence in them.\n \u00b7Ministers are responsible to parliament for the activities and decisions of their government departments. They are expected to answer questions during Question Time in parliament.\nAll ministers are responsible for the decisions made by the Cabinet. This is known as collective responsibility: members of Cabinet are expected to publicly support all decisions made in Cabinet.\nWhat is the Executive Council?\nThe Commonwealth Constitution provides for a Commonwealth Executive Council. The Governor-General acts on the advice given by this Executive Council. The Executive Council is made up of the ministers and parliamentary secretaries.

During the \n1890s a series of conventions were held to draw up a draft Constitution for the coming nation. Each colony was represented. The Constitution had to be passed by the British parliament, because they still had ultimate control over the colonies. The British Act was passed in 1900 and took effect on 1 January 1901. This Act is The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (UK). The Commonwealth was born.\nThe Australian Constitution established the guidelines for a Federation: it distributed \npowers between the Commonwealth and the six States, set out the structure of the Australian parliament and its power to make laws, and defi  ned the relationship between the Australian parliament and the States and their parliaments.\nSince 1901 there have been some alterations to the Australian Constitution, which \ndemonstrates that it is indeed a living document.\nALTERATIONS  TO THE \nAUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTION\n \u00b7Constitution Alteration (Senate Elections) 1906 (No. 1 of 1907)\n \u00b7Constitution Alteration (State Debts) 1909 (No. 3 of 1910)\n \u00b7Constitution Alteration (State Debts) 1928 (No. 1 of 1929)\n \u00b7Constitution Alteration (Social Services) 1946 (No. 81 of 1946)\n \u00b7Constitution Alteration (Aboriginals) 1967 (No. 55 of 1967)\n \u00b7Constitution Alteration (Senate Casual Vacancies) 1977 (No. 82 of 1977)\n \u00b7Constitution Alteration (Retirement of Judges) 1977 (No. 83 of 1977)\n \u00b7Constitution Alteration (Referendums) 1977 (No. 84 of 1977)\nTHE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE  AND \nTHE CONSTITUTION\nIn reality , \u2026 the Constitution is a document which was conceived by Australians, \ndrafted by Australians and approved by Australians.\nSince that time, Australia has become an independent nation, and the character \nof the Constitution as the fundamental law of Australia is now seen as resting predominantly , not on its status as an Act of the British Parliament, which no longer has any power over Australia, but on the Australian people\u2019s decision to approve and be bound by the terms of the\u00a0Constitution.\nWhat has been judicially described as \u2018the sovereignty of the Australian people\u2019 is \nalso recognised by section 128, which provides that any change to the Constitution must be approved by the people of Australia.\nFrom Australia\u2019s Constitution.

However, not all of the powers set out in section 51 are exclusive. To understand which powers in section 51 are the exclusive powers of the Commonwealth parliament you may need to look at other sections of the Constitution.\nExclusive by nature\nSome powers are exclusive to the Commonwealth because of what they are about. In\u00a0other words, they are exclusive because they refer to things that only a Commonwealth parliament can do. An example of this is section 51(iv): \u2018Borrowing money on the public credit of the Commonwealth\u2019. Other examples are sections 51(xxiv), (xxv), (xxx), (xxxi), (xxxiii), (xxxvi) and (xxxviii).Some powers in section \n51 are exclusive.

  "Page 248": "Exclusive because States are prohibited\nSome powers listed in section 51 can be used only by the Commonwealth parliament. \nFor example, section 51(xii) gives the Commonwealth parliament the power to make laws about currency , coinage and legal tender. Section 115 declares: \u2018A state shall not coin money , nor make anything but gold and silver coin legal tender in payment of debts. \u2019 Thus, section 51 gives the power to make laws about currency to the Commonwealth parliament, and section 115 specifi  cally prohibits States from coining money . Therefore, only the Commonwealth parliament has the power to coin money . The power to make laws about currency is therefore an exclusive power of the Commonwealth parliament.\nSimilarly , section 51(vi) of the Constitution specifi  es that the Commonwealth parliament \ncan make laws about raising an army , and section 114 says, \u2018a state shall not raise or maintain any naval or military force\u2019. Therefore, the power to make laws about military forces is an exclusive power of Commonwealth parliament.

The Marriage Act 1958 (Vic) provided laws for a valid marriage. Before this Act there was no Commonealth law about marriage. When the Commonwealth parliament passed the Marriage Act 1961 (Cth) it made the pre-existing Victorian legislation largely redundant because both laws covered the same areas, so the Commonwealth law prevailed. In this case there was no con\ufb02  ict between the State law and the Commonwealth law; the Victorian law was redundant because there was now a Commonwealth law that covered the same area.

In the late 1890s, they were preoccupied with ensuring a good system of government in Australia, and preventing the new Australian government from interfering with the rights of the States. Little thought was given to protecting the rights of individuals.\nThe writers of the Constitution shared a belief that the best way to protect individuals\u2019 \nrights was to ensure the peace, order and good government of Australia. They therefore created a system of structures designed to ensure good government. These checks and balances were designed to prevent governmental power being concentrated in the hands of a small number of people, who might then abuse it. Since its establishment other mechanisms have been incorporated into the Australian Constitution to ensure that these checks and balances work. They include:\n\u2022 the bicameral structure of Commonwealth parliament, with a Senate that acts as a \nhouse of review for the House of Representatives (see Chapter 6)\n\u2022 the separation of powers, which ensures that no one person holds the power to \nmake (legislature), administer (executive) and enforce (judiciary) the law\n\u2022 express rights, the fi  ve rights which are entrenched (explicitly named) in the Australian Constitution\n\u2022 the establishment of the High Court as the guardian of the Constitution of Australia, \nensuring that State and Australian governments abide by its terms\n\u2022 the stipulation that changing the Australian Constitution requires a referendum \nand that there has to be a double majority for a referendum to be successful (section\u00a0128).\nThe double majority \nrequirement in a \nreferendumAustralian Constitution\nChecking mechanisms\nThe bicameral structure \nof the Commonwealth \nparliamentThe separation \nof powersThe express \nprotection of rightsThe High Court\nFigure 7.5 Checking mechanisms of the Australian Constitution 244  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

The \nseparation of powers relies on courts being independent of the legislature and the executive. An aggrieved person is able take action in the courts, and the courts can act\u00a0as\u00a0a check on the other two arms of government if need be.\nEach arm of government is outlined in a separate chapter of the Australian Constitution:\n \u00b7Chapter I deals with the legislature.

They had faced possible contempt of court charges.\nFollowing comments, Melbourne barrister Rob Stary \ntold ABC Radio Melbourne: \u201cWe must have in a separation of powers doctrine an independent judiciary who should be free from political interference.\u201d He added: \u201cJudges are independent and they should be free from any political interference.\u201d\nThe separation of powers ensures that courts act as \nindependent umpires. They limit the action of the political and executive arms of government.Two former High Court judges have made this very clear. \nGiving the Southey Memorial Lecture in 1981, Sir Ninian Stephen said: \u201cIt is self-evident that the exercise of jurisdiction such as this will from time to time frustrate ambition, curtail power, invalidate legislation and fetter administrative action \u2026 This is part of our system of checks and balances. People who exercise political power and claim to represent the will of the people do not like being checked or balanced\u201d .\nIn a 1998 Melbourne speech, Murray Gleeson said: \n\u201cModern governments are expected to intervene in areas previously little regulated and the result is a greater intrusion into the private lives of those they govern. The greater that intrusion, the more occasions there will be for the citizen to complain of it. For redress of such complaints, whether because of a denial of bene/f_i  ts to which a citizen is entitled or of unlawful interference with his freedom of action according to law, it will be primarily to an independent judiciary that the citizen must look\u201d .\u2018Separation of powers\u2019 \nmeans that different bodies perform the three functions of a legal system: legislative, executive and judicial.

  "Page 254": "Legislative function\nIn the Australian legal system, the legislative function, or law-making power, is given to the \nparliament. At a federal level, the law-making power is given to the Australian parliament. At a State level, the power to make laws is given to each of the State parliaments.\nExecutive function\nThe executive function includes the administration of laws and the carrying out of the business of government. This includes the day-to-day management of government affairs. In theory , the Queen\u2019s representative, the Governor-General, exercises the executive function. However, the Governor-General acts on the advice given by the government of the day . In practice, through its ministers and government departments, the government is largely responsible for the administration of the law and for carrying out the other business of government.\nJudicial function\nThe judicial function is the task of applying the law . This function is given to the courts. The courts have the power to interpret the laws and to decide how these laws apply to individual cases. The courts are independent of the legislative and executive functions of the government. Therefore, the courts are not subject to political interference. The courts can act as a check on the use of law-making powers and on government actions.\nAlthough in theory there is a separation of powers between the executive and \nlegislative functions, in practice this distinction is blurred. Because the party that holds a majority in the lower house of parliament forms the government, there is some overlap. This is because some members of parliament (who perform a legislative function) are also ministers of the government (and perform an executive function). Furthermore, parliament sometimes gives the power to make regulations to government departments.\nLegislative function Executive function Judicial function\nThe power to make lawsThe power to implement \nand administer the laws\nThe power to enforce the \nlaw and settle disputes\nExercised by parliamentExercised by the \nGovernor-General on the \nadvice of the government Exercised by the courts\nSome overlap:\n\u2022  The Governor-General is part of both parliament and \nthe executive.\n\u2022  Some members of the parliament are also members \nof the government.Kept completely separate \u2013 \ncourts are independent of \npolitical pressure and \nin/f_luence.

For example, if an individual or group feels that a law contravenes the Constitution they can take the matter to court.\nNEWSREPORT  7.2\nWhy is the separation of powers important?\nIN 1981 SIR NINIAN STEPHEN, A FORMER HIGH COURT  \njustice, said:\nGovernments of the present day necessarily pose a \ngreater threat to individual liberties than did those of last century. Modern governments are expected to intervene in areas previously little regulated and the result is a greater intrusion into the private lives of those they govern. The greater the intrusion the more occasions there will be for the citizen to complain of it. [To protect their rights,] it will be primarily to an independent judiciary that the citizen must look.\nSo if a citizen thinks that the Australian parliament has \nexceeded its law-making powers, it is vital that there be an independent umpire. This is the job of the High Court. It resolves these disputes. The independence of the High Court is important in that it stands between the citizen and the law, and between the Australian parliament and the law in determining questions of rights.The separation of powers can create tension between \nthe political arms of government (the legislature and the executive) and the courts. That is a sign that the separation is working e\ufb00  ectively, that the courts are helping to ensure good government. In 1999 the Chief Justice of the High Court, Murray Gleeson, put it this way:\nIt is self-evident that the exercise of [judicial review] \nwill, from time to time, frustrate ambition, curtail power, invalidate legislation, and fetter administrative action \u2026 This is part of our system of checks and balances.

The action was taken by traditional/uni00A0owner Reggie Wurridjal and Bawinanga (a community organisation in the Arnhem Land community of Maningrida). They claimed that the takeover had not been done on \u2018just terms\u2019 .\nThe High Court challenge aimed to prevent the \ngovernment\u2019s compulsory acquisition of Aboriginal land/uni00A0and other assets under 5-year leases, and the abolition of the permit system controlling entry onto Aboriginal land. These controversial measures were imposed following a report into child sex abuse in Aboriginal communities.\nThe plainti\ufb00  s were seeking compensation in the \nHigh/uni00A0Court because:\n\u2022 abolishing the permit system would allow unlimited \naccess to sacred sites;\n\u2022 native title rights would be suspended; and\u2022 the Commonwealth would have exclusive possession \nover Aboriginal land.\nThe plainti\ufb00  s sought to have the takeover declared constitutionally invalid.\nThe Commonwealth, in response, argued that the \nplainti\ufb00  s had no case for compensation under s 51(xxxi) of the Constitution because the Commonwealth laws were made under the Territories power contained in s 122 of the Constitution, and that power does not require acquisitions of property to be on just terms. The Commonwealth relied on the 1969 case Teori Tau v The Commonwealth [1969] HCA/uni00A062, in which the High Court had held that laws made under s 122 were not subject to the \u2018just terms\u2019 requirement.\nIn February 2009 the High Court found for the \nCommonwealth, and held that the takeover was valid. But the court also overruled Teori Tau v The Commonwealth, holding that the requirement for just terms compensation did apply to laws made under the Territories power.

  "Page 259": "Section 80 of the Constitution guarantees the right to a trial by jury . This right applies to \noffences under Commonwealth law that are indictable. The constitutional right to a trial by jury does not extend, in theory , to offences against State law . High Court interpretations have further defi  ned the right to a trial by jury:\n\u2022 an accused person cannot elect to have a trial by a judge alone for a \nCommonwealth offence\n\u2022 majority verdicts cannot be used for Commonwealth offences \u2013 in all indictable \nCommonwealth offence trials, the jury verdict must be unanimous (this is not the case in relation to all offences that are indictable under State law).\nAn important limitation on the right to trial by jury is the fact that parliament can defi  ne which offences are \u2018indictable\u2019 offences.\nTRIAL BY JURY\nBrown v R [1986] HCA 11; (1986) 160 CLR 171\nIn Brown v R, the accused, Michael Rodney Jonathon Brown, was presented for trial \nin the Supreme Court of South Australia. He was charged with offences under s 233B(1)(ca) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). He pleaded not guilty . Before a jury was empanelled he elected to be tried by a judge alone under s 7(1) of the Juries Act 1927 (SA). The trial judge ruled that under s 80 of the Constitution it is not possible for a person indicted for an offence against a law of the Commonwealth \u2013 Brown\u2019s case did fall into this category \u2013 to make an election to be tried by a judge alone.\nBrown appealed the case to the High Court. The High Court decided that s 7 \nof the Juries Act (SA) contravened s 80 of the Australian Constitution, which states that there should be trial by jury for indictable Commonwealth offences. A person charged with an indictable Commonwealth offence who pleads not guilty must be tried by jury . This is an example of the rule that Commonwealth law prevails over State law when they are in con\ufb02  ict, to the extent of the con\ufb02  ict.\nFreedom of movement\nSection 92 of the Constitution provides that \u2018on the imposition of uniform duties of customs, \ntrade, commerce and intercourse among the States, whether by means of internal carriage or ocean navigation, shall be absolutely free\u2019. High Court interpretations have found the following:\n\u2022 that this freedom primarily relates to trade, commerce and communications\n\u2022 that \u2018the protection of s 92 is given to the movement of people, the transport of \ngoods, the transmission of communications, the passage of signals of any kind and \nany other means by which \u201cinterchange, converse and dealings between States in the affairs of life\u201d are carried across State boundaries \u2026 The means of movement will vary with what is moved; it is not essential that the means of movement be physically perceptible\u2019 (Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Wills (1992) 177 CLR 1 at 29 per\u00a0Brennan J)\n\u2022 that section 92 does not provide an absolute guarantee of freedom of movement. \nIn\u00a0Cole v Whit/f_i  eld (1988) 165 CLR 360 the High Court stated that personal movement across a border cannot, generally speaking, be impeded. More recent cases illustrate that section 92 does not provide an absolute guarantee of freedom of movement. If a law is not directly regulating interstate communication, but affects interstate commerce as part of regulating some other activity , it does not contravene the freedom expressed in section 92 provided that the law is not disproportionate or inappropriate to the legitimate constitutional purpose for which it has been made. For instance, in AMS v AIF (1999) 199 CLR 160, an injunction to restrain a mother from moving her child from Western Australia to the Northern Territory was\u00a0found not to infringe section 92.The Australian \nConstitution guarantees a trial by jury for offences under Commonwealth law that are indictable.\nThe Commonwealth Constitution provides for limited freedom of movement.

Williams challenged a funding agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and Scripture Union of Queensland, the group who provided chaplaincy services at the/uni00A0School.\nSo how can a case about school chaplains now a\ufb00  ect \nhow the government in Canberra funds programs?\nA complicated case\nThere were several bases for the constitutional challenge. One of the most publicised was the argument that it breached section 116 of the Constitution by requiring a religious test for an o\ufb03   ce under the Commonwealth. At/uni00A0Darling Heights State Primary School the chaplain was employed by Scripture Union of Queensland, which was funded by the Commonwealth.\nThe High Court unanimously dismissed this argument, \nand held that the connection between the chaplain and the/uni00A0Commonwealth was not su\ufb03   cient to render the chaplain an \u201co\ufb03   ce under the Commonwealth\u201d .\nThe point the case turned on then involved the breadth \nof the Commonwealth government\u2019s power to spend money and enter into contracts. This power is governed by/uni00A0the breadth of the Commonwealth\u2019s executive power but/uni00A0this power is ill-de/f_i  ned.\nSection 51 lists the legislative \u201cheads of power\u201d \u2013 speci/f_i  c \nareas of power. But executive power is not spelled out in the/uni00A0same way under section 61.Money and power\nPrior to this case there had been a long-held assumption that the Commonwealth executive power extended to entering into contracts and funding agreements in, at least, areas that fell within the Commonwealth\u2019s legislative heads of power \u2013 even where the Parliament had not passed legislation authorising those contracts and agreements.\nIf that was correct, the question would have \nbeen whether the funding agreement between the Commonwealth and the Scripture Union fell within the legislative heads of power, argued in this case under section/uni00A051(xx) and section 51(xxiiiA) of the Constitution with/uni00A0respect to trading corporations and the provision of/uni00A0bene/f_i  ts to students.\nIn this case, four of the judges (Chief Justice French and \nJustices Gummow, Bell and Crennan) expressly rejected this position. Two judges (Justices Hayne and Kiefel) did not determine this issue because they found the funding agreement did not fall within ss 51(xx) or (xxiiiA). Justice Heydon dissented.\nThe majority decision\nThe main reasons advanced by the majority centred on the federal nature of our constitutional system, and the importance of responsible and representative government (and therefore the role of Parliament) in it.\nSo, for example, Chief Justice French notes that if the \nCommonwealth had a wide executive power to spend money, there are \u201cconsequences for the Federation\u201d which would /f_l  ow from that.

The peace, good government and order of the Commonwealth may be protected at the same time as the freedom of religion is safeguarded. \u2019\n\u2022 Section 116 applies only to the Commonwealth. Few State constitutions specifi  cally \nrecognise religious freedom.\n\u2022 The right may be limited in the interest of national security or to ensure that people \nfollow the \u2018ordinary laws\u2019 of the community .\nIf the Commonwealth had power to enter into such \nagreements without legislative backing, policies could \nbe implemented in the absence of scrutiny from the Parliament, including the Senate.\nSo, generally speaking, it appears that the \nCommonwealth will need statutory authority to enter into contracts and spend public money. This exposes funding agreements to the scrutiny of the Houses of Parliament.\nHowever, the majority indicated there will be \nsome exceptions to this position, for example, contracts required to administer the departments of the Commonwealth pursuant to/uni00A0section 64 of the Constitution.\nThe funding agreement for the chaplaincy program \nwas held by the majority not to fall within these exceptions and was, therefore, invalid.\nFlow on e\ufb00  ects\nThere are many other funding agreements made by the Commonwealth, for example, many of the grants paid directly to local governments, which will fall outside these exceptions.\nThe Commonwealth must act quickly if it wants \nto save these types of agreements, including the agreements under the school chaplaincy program. Commonwealth funding agreements must be divided into two types: those that are with respect to the Commonwealth\u2019s legislative speci/f_i  c areas of power but have no legislative backing at the moment; and those that are not with respect to the Commonwealth\u2019s legislative speci/f_i  c areas of power.The /f_i  rst type can probably be saved relatively easily \nby legislation that retrospectively validates and provides authority to enter into these contracts.\nThis could be done on a piecemeal basis, or \nas Sir Owen Dixon once suggested, through a \u201cGeneral Contracts Act\u201d . This could say that the the Commonwealth Executive is and has been authorised to enter into any particular contract or agreement the entry into which could be or could have been authorised by any law made pursuant to any of the heads of legislative power in ss 51, 52 and 122 of the/uni00A0Constitution.\nFor the agreements under the NSCP this would then \nraise the question of whether they are \u201cwith respect to\u201d any of the heads of legislative power. Justices Hayne and Kiefel have already expressly found that they are not. Justice Heydon found that they are. The other judges did not decide the question.\nThose agreements that are not referable to a head of \nlegislative power cannot be saved in this way. That\u2019s not to say these funding arrangements cannot be saved at all. The Commonwealth Parliament has an (almost) unlimited power to make grants to States, on the terms and conditions it sees /f_i  t.\n(Source: adapted from an article by Gabrielle Appleby/uni00A0that \noriginally appeared in The Conversation 20 June 2012) Chapter 7  The people and the Australian Constitution 253\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

This section makes it unlawful to discriminate against a person based on the fact that they live in another State. It\u00a0does not provide a general protection against discrimination.\nFor instance, in Re Loubie [1986] 1 Qd R 272, a resident of New South Wales was \ncharged with a criminal offence in Queensland. Under the Queensland Bail Act, he would have been entitled to bail except for the fact that he was ordinarily a resident outside the State of Queensland. In the case, this provision of the Bail Act was seen as contravening section 117 of the Constitution, and thus invalid.\nClearly , these express rights are a check on parliament in relation to law-making in \nthese areas.\nDo express rights protect us?\nTable 7.3 Strengths and weaknesses of express rights\nStrengths Weaknesses\nThe /f_i  ve express rights are entrenched in the \nConstitution.

The legislation permitted money grants to denominational schools. This case claimed that these grants amounted to discrimination in favour of particular religious groups. It was argued that discrimination in favour of a religious group contravened section 116 of the Constitution. The High Court disagreed. The grants were not made to any one religious group. Therefore, the grants did not contravene section 116 of the Constitution.\nThe role of the High Court is discussed in more detail later in this Chapter.\nRequirement for a double majority \nin\u00a0a\u00a0referendum\nAs we have seen, the Australian Constitution acts as a check on parliament in the area of \nlaw-making. One important check is the process for changing the Constitution set out in \ns\u00a0128, known as a referendum.\nThe writers of the Commonwealth Constitution considered the Constitution to be \nso important that they made changing it a diffi  cult process. A proposed change can be introduced to either the House of Representatives or the Senate as a Bill. It must then be approved by parliament before the proposal can be put to the public. The proposal must be passed by both houses. Special provisions apply when one house rejects a referendum proposal twice.\nAfter it has been \npassed in both houses, the amendment is put to a vote of all enrolled electors nationally , to vote \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019. The referendum must receive a \u2018yes\u2019 vote from a majority of electors in Australia nationally , and a \u2018yes\u2019 vote from a majority of voters in a majority of the States (at least four out of six). This is sometimes referred to as a \u2018double majority\u2019. The double majority stipulation in the Constitution acts as a check on the law-making power of parliament. It ensures that the interests of the States and the interests of the national population are considered equally before any change to the Constitution can be\u00a0made.\nFigure 7.9 Double majority in a referendum For more \ninformation about \nthe role of the High Court, go to www.hcourt.gov.au.\nA proposed change to the Constitution must be/uni00A0passed by both houses/uni00A0of/uni00A0parliament.\nA referendum can only \nbe passed with a double majority: a \u2018yes\u2019 vote from a majority of electors in Australia nationally, and a \u2018yes\u2019 vote from a majority of voters in a majority of the States (at least four out of six). 256  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

If it is rejected a second time by\u00a0the second house, the Governor-General may still submit the proposed change to the\u00a0people if he/she feels that it is a suffi  ciently important issue.\nFirst\noccasion\nSecond\noccasionMoves to the other house\n(Senate or House of Representatives)\nDoes not passPasses by an absolute majority\nPasses by an absolute majority\nSigned by Governor-General (Royal Assent)\nProposed change put to voters in a referendumBill proposing a change to the Constitution is introduced \ninto the House of Representatives or Senate\nGovernor-General \nmay submit \nproposal to votersThree months later \nintroduced again \nto original house\nFigure 7.11 The process through parliament\nThe people\nThe proposed change is put to the people no sooner than 2 months and no later than \n6\u00a0months after the Bill has passed parliament.\nBefore the referendum is put to the people, the Australian Electoral Commission \nsends information to every household that explains the proposed change and provides arguments for and against.\nThe referendum is put to all eligible voters. Voters are required to answer \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019 \nto the question asked.

Since this power was not given to the Commonwealth, it remained with the State parliaments as a residual power.\nIn 1967, a referendum was \nheld to alter the words of the Commonwealth Constitution. The referendum succeeded, and this resulted in the deletion of words from the Constitution.\nThis referendum a\ufb00  ected \nthe division of legislative powers: the words in the Constitution had until then stopped the Commonwealth from legislating for Indigenous peoples, so this power had rested with the States, as a residual power. However, the successful referendum gave the Commonwealth speci/f_i  c (concurrent) power to make laws for Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Island people.\nFigure 7.16 Bill Onus, \nPresident of the \nVictorian Aborigines\u2019 \nAdvancement/uni00A0League\nEight successful referendums\nThis formula for popular approval was based on the procedure used in the Swiss \nFederation. During the fi  rst 70 years of its operation in Switzerland, this procedure resulted in 47 changes. In Australia, only 8 changes have resulted from 44 referendum proposals. The writers of the Constitution wanted a simple formula for amending the Constitution. However, they did not want one that would make the process too easy .\nReferendum proposals are diffi  cult to pass. The requirement to obtain a double \nmajority poses many problems. If a major political party does not support the proposal, the supporters of that political party will often vote against the proposal. Many voters do not understand the nature of the Constitution and the extent of the powers given to the Commonwealth parliament. These voters may not understand the effect of the proposed changes.

  "Page 273": "NEWSREPORT  7.8\nWhy referendums fail \u2013 lessons from the referendum for a republic\nIN AUSTRALIA, MOST REFERENDUMS DO NOT  \nsucceed. This is because the formal process of seeking \na change to the Constitution is so demanding. When writing the Commonwealth Constitution, the nation\u2019s founding fathers believed that the referendum process would protect Australians from proposals with unsound or unclear implications. For a referendum to succeed, a \u2018special majority\u2019 of Australians is required: the double majority \u2013 an overall majority plus majorities in a majority of States.\nA costly process\nIt was estimated that the 1999 republic referendum cost $91 million. This included the cost of a nationwide education program, advertising, the preparation of ballot papers and a poll by the Electoral Commission. The costs of the Electoral Commission alone were estimated to be in/uni00A0excess of $55 million.\nA di\ufb03   cult process\nDi\ufb03   culties in initiating constitutional change start with the amendment procedure. Section 128 of the Constitution sets out the conditions for changing the Constitution, which starts in Commonwealth parliament. This means that the government may have the whip hand from the start if the issue is one that the opposition does not/uni00A0support.\nA referendum Bill must /f_i  rst be passed by both houses, \nbut in practice, the Governor-General acts in the way he or she always acts: he or she will sign the writ for a referendum only on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. The current polarisation of federal politics has resulted in a referendum being a \u2018political football\u2019 , with both major parties being concerned with concentrating political power rather than dispersing or sharing it.\nThe double majority\nThe \u2018special majority\u2019 required for the success of a referendum proposal can be viewed as a veto. Australians have not been afraid to use this veto, saying no to 36 of 44 proposals. Of the defeats, 31 proposals received less than 50% of the total vote and 11 failed to receive majorities in any of the six States. Only /f_i  ve proposals have failed because, despite receiving a majority of votes, they did not obtain the support of a majority of States. Proposals of low signi/f_i  cance have tended to succeed.Apathy or understanding\nThe failure of referendums is sometimes attributed to voter apathy and failure to understand the nature of the/uni00A0proposal.\nSome people could view the history of referendum \nproposals as showing that Australians were non-thinkers and negative. However, research has shown that informal voting is low and that voters have been able to distinguish between proposals when two or more are put to the vote.\nKeys to success\nOne essential element is needed for a referendum proposal to be successful: there must be federal consensus before and during the referendum campaign. The Prime Minister, as leader of the government, is usually pivotal in the referendum debate. The republic question showed for the /f_i  rst time a Prime Minister actively campaigning against the proposal. However, two leading frontbenchers, Treasurer Peter Costello and industrial relations minister Peter Reith, had views di\ufb00  erent from their leader. The double majority requirement for success means that the support of key players for the referendum must be evident not only at a national level but also at a State level.\nAnother essential element is communicating the \nreasons for change clearly to voters. One lesson learnt from the republic referendum is the importance of those advocating change being able to communicate the advantages of the change.\nFigure 7.17 The Yes/No referendum booklet, advising \nvoters of both sides of the argument Chapter 7  The people and the Australian Constitution 265\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

When the Constitution was written, the post and telegraph were the main forms of communication. In 1905, the Commonwealth parliament passed the Wireless Telegraphy Act. Under this Act, all owners of wireless sets (radios) were required to have a licence. The defendant was charged with having a wireless without a licence. She challenged the validity of the law , claiming that the Constitution did not give the Commonwealth parliament power to make laws about wireless sets.\nTo resolve this dispute, the High Court had to interpret the meaning of \nthe words \u2018like services\u2019 in section 51(v). The High Court decided that a wireless was a \u2018like service\u2019.\nTherefore, the Wireless Telegraphy Act was valid.\nJones v Commonwealth (No. 2) [1965] HCA 6; (1965) 112 CLR 206\nA similar case occurred in 1965. In this case, the validity of the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942\u20131962 (Cth) was questioned. Television had not been invented when the Constitution was written. There is no direct reference to making laws about television in the Constitution. In this case, the High Court decided that television was also a \u2018like service\u2019 under section 51(v). Therefore the Broadcasting and Television Act was valid.\nThese interpretations of the Constitution indicate that the term \u2018like services\u2019 gives the Commonwealth \nparliament the power to make laws on a range of communication technologies.\nThis case had a signifi  cant impact, as it meant a shift in the division of law-making powers from the States \nto the Commonwealth: the power to make laws in relation to broadcasting and wireless sets now lay with the Commonwealth parliament.

  "Page 276": "Implications of representative \ngovernment\nIn addition to the express rights, the High Court has considered that some rights may \nbe implied by the Constitution. This involves drawing implications from the words of the Constitution. An implication is something that is meant or intended but not actually said. An implied right is a right that was intended by the drafters of the Constitution but not expressly stated in the document.\nThe idea that the Constitution can be interpreted to include rights that are implied, but \nnot stated, is much debated. Some commentators feel that these interpretations go beyond the role of the court, which is to interpret the meaning of the Constitution. However, as the Constitution provides for an elected and representative government, one could argue that it implies the need for a free debate so that the vote is informed and the representative government is effective.\nRight to freedom of political \ncommunication\nThe right to freedom of speech is not stated in the Constitution. However, the High \nCourt has determined that the Constitution contains an implied right to freedom of \ncommunication on political matters.\nThis implied right was fi  rst recognised in the case of Australian Capital Television Pty \nLtd v The Commonwealth (No. 2) [1992] HCA 45; (1992) 66 ALJR 695. This case is also known as the political advertising case.Implied rights can \nbe read/uni00A0into the Commonwealth Constitution by the High/uni00A0Court.\nFreedom of communication on public affairs and political matters is implied in the/uni00A0Constitution.7.8   Signifi  cance of the High \nCourt\u2019s interpretation of sections 7 and 24\nA key principle of the Australian parliamentary system is to ensure that we have a \nrepresentative government: this means preventing governments abusing their power by\u00a0making them answerable to the people at regular elections. This also aims to ensure\u00a0that members of parliament represent the views and needs of those who voted them in.\nRepresentative government is set up by two sections of the Australian Constitution:\n\u2022 section 7, which requires that the Senate be \u2018directly chosen by the people\u2019; and\u2022 section 24, which states that the House of Representatives must be \u2018directly chosen\nby the people\u2019.\nRoach v Electoral Commissioner  \n[2007]\u00a0HCA 43\nIn Roach v Electoral Commissioner [2007] HCA 43; (2007) CLR 162, the High Court held \nthat the requirement that there be representative government indirectly protected the right of adults to vote.

Sections 7 (Senate) and 24 (House of Representatives) require that members of parliament be \u2018directly chosen by the people\u2019.\nFacts of the case\nIn 2007 Ms Vickie Lee Roach took a case to the High Court seeking to clarify whether the Constitution protected the right to vote. Ms Roach was a 49-year-old Aboriginal woman who was serving a 5-year sentence for negligently causing serious injury in a car accident. At the time, Ms Roach was validly enrolled to vote in the Federal seat of Kooyong in Victoria. She would still be imprisoned during the November 2007 election. Ms Roach sought to challenge legislation that would stop her from voting at that election.\nIn 2006 the Australian parliament had amended the Commonwealth Electoral Act \n1918 (Cth); the amendment imposed a complete ban on any prisoner voting. Before this change, only prisoners serving terms of 3 years or more were disquali/f_i  ed.\nMs Roach sued the Electoral Commission in the High Court of Australia. She argued \nthat the complete ban was invalid since:\n\u00b7it interfered with the system of representative government the Constitution set up,\nthus breaching section 7 and section 24; or\n\u00b7it violated the implied right to political freedom of communication.\nThe decision\nBy a majority (Gleeson CJ, who delivered an individual judgment, and a joint judgment from Gummow, Kirby and Crennan JJ), the High Court held that the Constitution\u2019s requirement for representative government was a restriction on the Australian parliament\u2019s power to decide who may vote. The High Court held that there is now constitutional Case related to \ninterpretation of sections/uni00A07 and 24: Roach/uni00A0v AEC [2007] HCA 43; (2007) CLR/uni00A0162.protection of the right of Australian adults to vote. However, the Court held that the right \nto vote was not protected by the implied right of political communication.\nInstead, the majority held that the structure of representative government in the \nAustralian Constitution limits the Australian parliament\u2019s power to decide who may vote. (Gleeson CJ\u2019s judgment focused on particular parts of the structure of representative government, sections 7 and 24, to reach his conclusion. Gummow, Kirby and Crennan JJ focused on the whole structure to reach a similar conclusion.) So the parliament cannot pass laws that, by unreasonably taking away the right to vote of a class of persons, would interfere with representative government.\nIn this case the complete ban on prisoners voting was unreasonable, since many were \nserving short terms for minor offences. But the old ban \u2013 on prisoners who are serving terms of 3 years or more \u2013 was valid, since the length of sentence indicated that the prisoner had engaged in conduct that was viewed as taking them outside community expectations. So Ms Roach won the legal point but did not regain her vote.\nThis decision was a signi/f_i  cant one, as the \nHigh Court\u2019s interpretation of section 7 and section 24 of the Australian Constitution has seen a range of views being expressed by eminent academic lawyers seeking to further clarify the relationship between the structures and text of the Constitution and rights which are protected.

  "Page 277": "Implications of representative \ngovernment\nIn addition to the express rights, the High Court has considered that some rights may \nbe implied by the Constitution. This involves drawing implications from the words of the Constitution. An implication is something that is meant or intended but not actually said. An implied right is a right that was intended by the drafters of the Constitution but not expressly stated in the document.\nThe idea that the Constitution can be interpreted to include rights that are implied, but \nnot stated, is much debated. Some commentators feel that these interpretations go beyond the role of the court, which is to interpret the meaning of the Constitution. However, as the Constitution provides for an elected and representative government, one could argue that it implies the need for a free debate so that the vote is informed and the representative government is effective.\nRight to freedom of political \ncommunication\nThe right to freedom of speech is not stated in the Constitution. However, the High \nCourt has determined that the Constitution contains an implied right to freedom of \ncommunication on political matters.\nThis implied right was fi  rst recognised in the case of Australian Capital Television Pty \nLtd v The Commonwealth (No. 2) [1992] HCA 45; (1992) 66 ALJR 695. This case is also known as the political advertising case.Implied rights can \nbe read/uni00A0into the Commonwealth Constitution by the High/uni00A0Court.\nFreedom of communication on public affairs and political matters is implied in the/uni00A0Constitution.7.8   Signifi  cance of the High \nCourt\u2019s interpretation of sections 7 and 24\nA key principle of the Australian parliamentary system is to ensure that we have a \nrepresentative government: this means preventing governments abusing their power by\u00a0making them answerable to the people at regular elections. This also aims to ensure\u00a0that members of parliament represent the views and needs of those who voted them in.\nRepresentative government is set up by two sections of the Australian Constitution:\n\u2022 section 7, which requires that the Senate be \u2018directly chosen by the people\u2019; and\u2022 section 24, which states that the House of Representatives must be \u2018directly chosen\nby the people\u2019.\nRoach v Electoral Commissioner  \n[2007]\u00a0HCA 43\nIn Roach v Electoral Commissioner [2007] HCA 43; (2007) CLR 162, the High Court held \nthat the requirement that there be representative government indirectly protected the right of adults to vote.

These amendments imposed bans on radio and television advertising for Federal, State and local government elections. The High Court held that the law was invalid because there was an implied right of freedom of communication on political/uni00A0matters.\nThe High Court stated that:\u2022 the Constitution establishes a system (or structure) of representative government\u2022 in a representative government, members of parliament are directly elected by the \nvote of electors\n\u2022 a free discussion or debate about public a\ufb00  airs and political matters is essential to an \ninformed vote, which is essential to the system of representative government\n\u2022 since the Constitution provides for an elected and representative government, it \nimplies the need for a free debate so that the vote is informed and the representative government e\ufb00  ective.\nImpact on defamation laws\nThis interpretation of freedom of communication on political matters was extended in \n1994 in the case of Theophanous v Herald and Weekly Times Ltd [1994] HCA 46: (1994) 182 CLR 104. In this case the High Court decided that the Constitution protected, in most circumstances, those who commented on individuals engaged in political debates from being sued for defamation. It stated that the Constitution protects a \u2018free \ufb02  ow\u2019 of information and ideas between politicians, voters and anyone else involved in political processes (such as trade unions, community groups, and political and economic commentators).\nThe Constitution therefore protects discussion of the political views and public \nconduct of people who are engaged in activities that have become the subject of political debate. The result of the Theophanous case means that the implied right of freedom of communication on political matters could be used as a defence in a defamation action.\nNEWSREPORT  7.10\nThe gun control case\nIn 1995, the Victorian County Court \nheard one of the /f_i  rst cases claiming freedom of speech on government and political matters. The defence was based on the Theophanous case. The case involved the Sporting Shooters\u2019 Association of Australia, Victoria (SSAAV) and Gun Control Australia. The SSAAV sued Gun Control Australia for defamation. The SSAAV claimed that two defamatory articles were published in the Gun Control Australia magazine in January and May 1990. In determining whether the articles could be described as \u2018government and political matters\u2019 , the judge considered the context in which the articles were published. The SSAAV and Gun Control Australia were the main parties involved in a public gun control debate. The judge considered that the articles were part of the ongoing debate about gun control and therefore part of a political discussion. The judge found that the defendants were not liable for defamation because the articles were part of a political debate and there is a constitutional right to freedom of communication on government and political matters. 270  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 279": "Limitations on freedom of political \ncommunication\nIn 1997, the High Court considered a defamation suit brought against the Australian \nBroadcasting Corporation (ABC) by former New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange. In this case, Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1997] HCA 25: (1997) 189 CLR 520, the High Court held that there was no absolute right to freedom of communication.\nThe High Court stated that parliament can pass a law restricting freedom of \ncommunication for some legitimate reason. These restrictions would be valid if:\n\u2022 the object of the law is compatible with the maintenance of the system of \nrepresentative and responsible government provided for by the Constitution; and\n\u2022 the law is reasonably appropriate and adapted to achieving that legitimate object \nor end.\nThis freedom limits the ability of parliaments to restrict free political communication, rather than guaranteeing the rights of individuals. In addition, freedom of communication does not apply to the discussion of political matters in other countries.\nCHANGES  IN HIGH COURT \nINTERPRETATIONS OVER TIME\nIn the fi  rst 20 years after Federation the High Court interpreted the powers of the \nCommonwealth parliament in a very limited way . The High Court was more attuned to protecting States\u2019 rights, and took the view that any Commonwealth law that would restrict these \u2018reserved powers\u2019 was invalid.\nThis changed in 1920 when the High Court decided that the Constitution should \nbe given a much broader interpretation \u2013 it should be interpreted according to the natural meaning of the words. Since the 1980s the High Court has appeared to be giving the Constitution a very liberal interpretation, expanding the range of law-making powers that can be used by the Commonwealth parliament.\nIn recent years, some commentators have suggested that the High Court has \nadopted an \u2018activist\u2019 role in interpreting the Constitution. The term \u2018activist\u2019 implies that the High Court is working towards bringing about\u00a0change.\nThere are a number of reasons for the High Court adopting an activist \napproach to the Constitution. These reasons include economic changes, changes in the nature of war and therefore defence, and changes in communication and transportation. Between 1901 and the start of the 21st century there have been signifi  cant changes in world politics and in the nature of diplomacy . The High Court must somehow take all of this into account.\nThe impact of High Court interpretations of the Constitution can be seen in \nseveral areas:\n \u00b7the powers of the Commonwealth parliament in relation to external affairs\n \u00b7the fi  nancial relationship between the Commonwealth and State governments\n \u00b7the implied right of political communication.Freedom of political \ncommunication operates as a limit on parliament\u2019s powers.

  "Page 280": "NEWSREPORT  7.11\nHas the High Court gone too far?\nFOR MANY AUSTRALIANS, THE HIGH COURT MAY  \nconjure up images of bewigged elderly men toiling \nover books. Long seen as the bastion of tradition and conservative attitudes, the High Court provided a narrow and legalistic application of our Constitution in the past. However, since the mid-1980s things have been rapidly changing. The rate of change in recent years has resulted in the court being criticised for being too revolutionary \u2013 an unaccountable, unelected maker of new laws.\n1980s \u2013 a change in approach\nFrom 1987 onwards, there has been a clear change in approach: the High Court now considers the intentions of the authors of the Constitution in deciding how the Constitution should be interpreted.\nUnder Chief Justice Mason (1987\u201395), the High Court \nhad been the most activist court that Australia had ever seen. In the landmark case of Cole v Whit/f_i  eld [1988] HCA 18; (1988) 164 CLR 360, the Court increased the power of governments to regulate interstate trade by reversing the established interpretation of section 92 of the/uni00A0Constitution.\nSusan Kiefel, the /f_i  rst female Chief Justice of the \nHigh/uni00A0Court1990s \u2013 protecting rights\nIn the 1990s, the Court signalled a new era of \nconstitutional interpretation. It protected the rights of the accused to a fair trial. It recognised the right to freedom of speech as an implied intention of the founding fathers. This was a period of new commitment to the protection of rights.\nGeorge Williams, a well-known scholar in \nconstitutional law, describes the High Court at this time as \u2018avowedly activist in that it was prepared to confront its role in common law and the interpretation of the Constitution where justice or the needs of contemporary Australia/uni00A0dictated\u2019 .\nThe pace of change\nThe 1990s were also a period of signi/f_i  cant controversy about the role of the High Court. No longer was the High Court seen as irrelevant to or remote from daily a\ufb00  airs. It became the subject of media and public debate. Under Mason, the High Court handed down a great number of landmark decisions over a relatively short period of time. The pace of change was partly due to the types of cases that the Court was now hearing. The High Court only hears the most di\ufb03   cult cases. There are no easy answers to/uni00A0these cases and they often have political implications.\nThe pace of change can also be attributed to the \nmembership of the Court. During the Mason period, the court was made up of judges who were prepared to recognise their role as law-makers.\nHigh Court or parliament?\nSome commentators see Australia\u2019s High Court as travelling too far from the traditions of British legal principles. It has been claimed that the Court has moved too close to the US model, where the Supreme Court is seen as the last line of defence against bad laws and government interference in civil liberties.\nCritics also argue that there has been a shift in political \nresponsibility from the parliament to the High Court and that politically contentious issues are best handled by/uni00A0parliament.\nOthers contest this view. They argue that the High \nCourt was established as part of a system of checks and balances on the power of parliament and the executive. The High Court performs an important role in protecting our rights. It protects us against potential abuse of power. It interprets the powers of the parliament and the limits on the use of those powers. Given a global context of rapid social, economic and political change, this is not an easy/uni00A0task. 272  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 281": "HIGH COURT LANDMARKS\n1901 The High Court was created by the Constitution.\n1901\u201320 The High Court had a strict interpretation of the meaning of the Constitution. Three of the judges \nwho were sitting on the High Court were involved in drafting the Constitution. These judges saw \nthe Constitution as an agreement between the States that gave the Commonwealth parliament restricted and limited powers. The Constitution was interpreted in a way that would preserve the reserved powers of the States.\n1920 The High Court heard the Engineers\u2019 Case (Amalgamated Society of Engineers v Adelaide \nSteamship Co. [1920] HCA 54; (1920) 28 CLR 129). In this case the High Court established the principle that it would give the Constitution the broadest possible meaning. Over the following years there was a general widening of the interpretation of section 51.\n1940s In the First Uniform Tax Case (South Australia v Commonwealth [1942] HCA 14; (1942) 65 CLR \n373), the High Court decided that the Commonwealth parliament had the power to tax incomes. The Commonwealth had, using its taxation power, passed legislation that created a national income tax. Before then, each State had its own income tax laws. The new Commonwealth income tax was payable at such a high rate that a taxpayer could not effectively pay both income taxes. The States challenged the tax in the High Court. They argued\u00a0that:\n - taxation was a concurrent power,\n - the Commonwealth tax was so high that people would not be able to pay State income tax, \nand\u00a0therefore\n - the States would no longer be able to impose income taxes.\nThe High Court disagreed, and held that since section 109 ensured that Commonwealth law \noverrode inconsistent State laws on concurrent powers, the Commonwealth could impose such a tax. This decision gave the Commonwealth government a signifi  cant fi  nancial advantage over State governments, and broadened the Commonwealth parliament\u2019s powers in relation to taxation. In the State Banking Case of 1947, the High Court held that the Commonwealth parliament cannot pass laws whose sole purpose is to restrict and control State governments (Melbourne Corporation v Commonwealth [1947] HCA 26; (1947) 74 CLR 31). However, the judgment of the First Uniform Tax case stood, giving the Commonwealth the ability to dominate this area of concurrent power.\n1980s The High Court broadened its interpretation of external affairs power to include making laws to \nimplement international treaties in Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen and Others [1982] HCA 27; (1982) 153 CLR 168, and Commonwealth v Tasmania (Tasmanian Dam Case) [1983] HCA 21; (1983) 158 CLR 1.\n1990s The High Court recognised that there is an implied right to freedom of communication about \npolitical affairs.\n2000s The High Court emphasised the importance of a representative government in its interpretation \nof sections 7 and 24 in the case of Roach v AEC [2007] HCA 43; (2007) CLR 162.\nActivity 7.8  Folio exercise\nUnderstanding the signifi  cance of ss 7 and \n24 of Australia\u2019s Constitution\nRead \u2018Do we have the right to vote?\u2019 and the article \u2018Political advertising case\u2019 \nand/uni00A0complete the following tasks:\n1 De/f_i  ne the term \u2018representative government\u2019.\n2 Identify the two sections in the Constitution that relate to having a \nrepresentative government.\n3 Referring to the Roach case to support your answer, explain how the structure of/uni00A0representative government protects the right to vote.\n4 Referring to the article \u2018Political advertising case\u2019, explain how the structure of representative government impliedly protects freedom of communication on political matters.

  "Page 283": "7.9   International declarations and \ntreaties and their impact on the external affairs power\nWhat are treaties and declarations?\nTreaties are formal agreements between nations. Treaties can be bilateral: between \ntwo nations. An example of this is the aviation agreement between Australia and the \nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE). Multilateral treaties are between three or more nations, and an example is the United Nations (UN) Charter. Multilateral treaties are generally developed through international (inter-governmental) organisations such as the UN or the International Labor Organization (ILO), but regional multilateral treaties such as the Convention for the Protection of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacifi  c Region (SPREP) are of growing importance for Australia.\nFrequently , \u2018declarations\u2019, such as the Declaration on the Rights of the Child, are \nadopted by the UN General Assembly . However, those declarations are not treaties, which means they are not intended to be binding. Such declarations may , however, be part of a long process that leads ultimately to the negotiation of a UN Convention such as the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is intended to be binding on the member states that adopt it. They may also, in certain circumstances, help in the interpretation of a treaty , as is the case with the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States (1970).\nNEWSREPORT  7.12\nWhat does the Constitution say about treaties \nand/uni00A0declarations?\nTHE CONSTITUTION SETS OUT TWO POWERS IN RELATION TO INTERNATIONAL  \ndeclarations and treaties:\n\u2022 First, there is the power to enter into international declarations and treaties, which is \nan executive power.\n\u2022 Second, there is the power to implement international declarations and treaties, \nwhich is a legislative power.\nSection 51(xxix) of the Constitution gives the Commonwealth parliament the power to \nlegislate with respect to \u2018external a\ufb00  airs\u2019 . This has been interpreted by the High Court to mean that the Commonwealth parliament may legislate to implement in Australian law an international declaration or treaty that has been entered into by the executive under section 61 of the Constitution:\nThe executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable \nby the Governor-General as the Queen\u2019s representative, and extends to the execution and maintenance of this Constitution, and of the laws of the Commonwealth.\nWhy do we need treaties?\nImprovements in technology , and the increasing globalisation of the world, have meant \nthat countries are interacting more frequently . This can be challenging, and concerns should be discussed between all relevant parties. Thus, if a country has a vested interest in a particular industry or issue they may sign a treaty either with one other nation (bilateral) or with several other nations or international organisations (multilateral) to ensure that their voice is heard about that particular area.The external affairs \npower means that the Commonwealth can make laws to implement international declarations and treaties.\nTreaties are formal \nagreements between two or more nations. They are binding at international law and they cover areas of importance to all/uni00A0signatories.\nInternational declarations \nare different from treaties in that they are not intended to be binding.

  "Page 285": "  Legal brief 7.3 \nImpact of treaties on the Constitution\nAs we saw earlier, section 61 provides the power to the executive, rather than parliament, \nto enter into treaties. This means that important decisions related to treaty negotiations \u2013 which include determining the objectives of the treaty, determining the limits of Australia\u2019s power and /f_i  nally deciding whether or not Australia should actually sign and ratify the treaty being discussed \u2013 are taken at ministerial level, usually by Cabinet.\nHowever, just signing a treaty does not make it law in Australia. The Commonwealth \nparliament must pass legislation to implement the terms of the treaty. The Commonwealth parliament is given this power in section 51(xxix) of the Constitution.\nWhat are external affairs?\nAt the time when the Commonwealth Constitution was being drafted, the subject of international declarations and treaties was not considered particularly important. The Commonwealth parliament was given power to implement these for Australia by way of legislation. However, the types of declarations and treaties that existed at that time were unlikely to have a signi/f_i  cant impact on traditional areas of government responsibility.\nAs noted by Sir Robert Menzies in \u2018The High Court and the external affairs power\u2019 \n(HP/uni00A0Lee and G Winterton (eds), Australian Constitutional Perspectives, Law Book Co., 1992):\nWhen the draftsmen of the Constitution wrote down the magic words \u2018external \naffairs\u2019, there did not leap into their minds any vision of the complex and novel things that were to come many years later. Least of all could they have imagined a comprehensive world organisation of which Australia would be a member, that there would be an International Labor Organization, or that the political stuff of 19th century treaties would largely have substituted for it the bargaining of merchants, of exporters and importers, agreements in the /f_i  elds of health and science, the literally hundreds of matters engaging our attention and turning our eyes out to other lands and other peoples.\nExternal affairs today\nToday, the external affairs power is seen as giving the Commonwealth parliament the \npower to make laws about matters physically external to Australia and laws affecting Australia\u2019s relations with other nations. This power enables the Commonwealth parliament to legislate to implement Australia\u2019s obligations under international agreements. The interpretation of the external affairs power by the High Court has also allowed the Commonwealth parliament to make laws about matters that have traditionally been considered the residual powers of the States.\nHowever, there are some limitations to the scope of the power. They include:\n \u00b7constitutional restrictions and prohibitions on the Commonwealth parliament \u2013 express constitutional guarantees (such as freedom of interstate trade) and implied constitutional guarantees (such as the prohibition on legislation discriminating against the States or preventing a State from continuing to exist and function as/uni00A0such)\n \u00b7the treaty must be genuine (bona fide)\n \u00b7the law implementing the treaty must be a reasonable and appropriate means of giving effect to the purpose of the treaty.

  "Page 286": "International declarations, treaties and \nAustralian law\nThe Constitution gave the Commonwealth the power to enter into treaties and \ninternational declarations.\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s powers in relation to treaties were not widely used until the \npast 30 years. Although the Commonwealth government had unlimited powers to sign treaties, it was not clear that the Commonwealth parliament would be able to pass laws to implement treaty obligations. The position was clarifi  ed in the following cases, which indicate that the Commonwealth parliament has a broad power to legislate to implement the terms of an international agreement.\nTHE KOOWARTA  CASE\nKoowarta v Bjelke-Petersen and Others [1982] HCA 27; \n(1982) 153 CLR 168\nIn this case John Koowarta, an Aboriginal Australian man, attempted to purchase the Archer River cattle station, which covered much of the Wik nation\u2019s traditional land. The Queensland government, headed by Joh Bjelke-Petersen, blocked the sale on the grounds that Aboriginal people should not be allowed to buy large areas of\u00a0land.\nKoowarta argued that the Queensland government could not do this under \nthe Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth), a Commonwealth Act which ratifi  ed an international treaty .\nThe Queensland government argued that the Racial Discrimination Act was not \nvalid because the Commonwealth parliament did not have the power to make laws about racial discrimination. The Queensland government argued that the external affairs power should be given a limited interpretation. It should not be used to allow the Commonwealth parliament to take over the residual powers of the States.\nThe majority of the judges in this case decided that the Racial Discrimination Act \nwas valid: it was a legitimate use of the Commonwealth\u2019s power to make laws to implement international agreements. The Commonwealth parliament can use the external affairs power to pass a law , provided it:\n \u00b7gives effect to an obligation;\n \u00b7is imposed on Australia by an international convention or treaty to which Australia is a party;\n \u00b7concerns a matter of that convention or treaty which is an international concern; and\n \u00b7concerns the relationship between Australia and other countries.\nThe Archer River /f_l  ows through the land contested in Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen 278  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 287": "THE FRANKLIN DAM  CASE\nCommonwealth v Tasmania [1983] HCA 21; (1983) 158 CLR 1\nIn this case the Tasmanian government challenged the validity of the World Heritage Properties Conservation \nAct 1983 (Cth). This Act was passed by the Commonwealth parliament. The Act prohibited the clearing, excavation and building of a dam in protected areas, including an area on the Gordon River (below its junction with the Franklin River). The Gordon and Franklin rivers run through large areas of untouched wilderness. These wilderness areas contain many unique features. The \ufb02  ooding of the two rivers would have seriously damaged this signifi  cant area.\nThe area was nominated by the \nCommonwealth government to be included in the World Heritage List. The\u00a0World Heritage List was established by an international treaty , which Australia had signed, and aimed to protect the world\u2019s cultural and natural heritage. The High Court was asked to determine whether the Commonwealth parliament had the power to ban the building of a dam in\u00a0Tasmania.\nThe Commonwealth parliament \nclaimed that, under sections 51(xxix), 51(xx) and 51(xxvi), the Constitution implied that it could make laws on matters of national concern. The High Court decided that the external affairs power gave the Commonwealth parliament the power to make laws that fulfi  l Australia\u2019s obligations under international treaties. Australia had signed a treaty to protect World Heritage areas, therefore the Commonwealth parliament was able to make laws to protect Australia\u2019s heritage.\nDecisions in cases such as the Koowarta case and the Franklin Dam case were seen \nas greatly expanding the powers of Commonwealth parliament. In the past 30 years, the Commonwealth parliament has passed laws relating to the environment, racial discrimination and human rights, and has increased the size of the Australian fi  shing zone \u2013 all based on its external affairs power. It has been speculated that, unless the High Court acts to limit the interpretation of this power, the external affairs powers of the\u00a0Commonwealth parliament are almost unlimited.\nThere have been a number of High Court cases looking at treaties and the \ninterpretation of what constitutes an \u2018external affair\u2019.\nThe Koowarta case demonstrates the impact of the International Convention \non the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which Australia signed on 13\u00a0October\u00a01966.\nTable 7.7 Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen and Others [1982] HCA 27; (1982) 153 CLR 168\nRelevant treaty Facts The issue The decision\nInternational \nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial DiscriminationThe Aboriginal Land Fund Commission \nentered into a contract to buy a pastoral lease in Queensland. The Queensland Minister for Lands refused to give his consent to the transfer of the lease because the Queensland government\u2019s policy was opposed to the acquisition of large parts of the State by Indigenous Australians. Mr Koowarta brought an action against the Premier of Queensland, Mr Bjelke-Petersen.Mr Koowarta claimed that the Premier had breached sections 9 and 12 of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth). The Queensland government responded by challenging the Commonwealth parliament\u2019s power to make a law about racial discrimination.The High Court decided that the Commonwealth racial discrimination law related to external affairs because it:\n \u00b7gave effect to an obligation imposed on Australia by an international convention or treaty to which Australia is a/uni00A0party;\n \u00b7related to a matter under convention or treaty that is an international concern; and\n \u00b7concerned the relationship between Australia and other countries.The High Court\u2019s \ninterpretation of external affairs has expanded the Commonwealth\u2019s law-making powers.

A subsequent Tasmanian government authorised the construction of a dam on the Franklin River within this area.\nIn 1982 the area was accepted by the World \nHeritage Committee for entry into the World Heritage List. In 1983, the Commonwealth passed the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act and prohibited the construction of a dam in the heritage area.The Tasmanian government questioned the ability of the Commonwealth parliament to make a law to stop construction activity in a World Heritage area in Tasmania.The High Court decided the Act was valid on a variety of constitutional grounds, one of which was the external affairs power.

The Act provided interim protection for the area, to prevent damage or destruction prior to the commission making its decision.The Commonwealth Minister for the Environment commenced an action against the Forestry Commission of Tasmania and a timber business, claiming that they breached the interim protection measures in the Act. The defendants challenged the validity of the legislation.The High Court held that the Commonwealth had the power to pass this legislation because the external affairs power extends to:\n \u00b7a law required to discharge a treaty obligation that is known to exist; and\n \u00b7a law that is required to ensure the discharge of a treaty obligation which is reasonably apprehended to exist.\nName of case Facts The issue The decision\nQueensland \nRainforest case\nQueensland v The \nCommonwealth [1989] HCA 36; (1989) 167 CLR 232A proclamation was made by the Governor-\nGeneral under the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983 (Cth), to protect an area of rainforest in Queensland.

  "Page 294": "8.1   The ability of parliament \nto make laws\nThe main role of parliament is to make laws. Parliament is responsible to the public, which \nhas elected its members to represent their interests. Public opinion is the barometer of \nchanging social needs, to which parliament may respond.\nLegislative change may result from changing needs, changing values or technological \nadvances, or through omissions or inconsistencies in existing legislation. The reasons for change in the law are discussed in more detail in Chapter 10.\nThere are a number of factors that affect the ability of parliament to make laws. These \nare the roles of the houses, the representative nature of parliament, political pressures and restrictions on the legislative powers of parliament.\nThe majority of legislation is put forward by the government as a result of Cabinet \ndecisions. Other in\ufb02  uences on legislative policy include approaches to members of parliament, reports of committees or the public service, or pressure from the opposition, a political party , pressure groups, interest groups, the media, trade unions or other organisations.\nThe number of Acts passed by parliament in any sitting (sitting periods are generally \naround 2 weeks at a time: in 2016 the House of Representatives sat for 51 days in total and the Senate sat for 42 days in total) depends on several factors. These include the amount of business before the parliament at that sitting, the nature and urgency of the legislation, political expediency , public support and the degree of opposition.\n8.2  The legislative process\nA law passed by parliament is known as \u2018an Act\u2019, \u2018legislation\u2019 or \u2018a statute\u2019. The procedure \nused by parliaments to make a law is known as the legislative process.

  "Page 295": "Bills\nA Bill is a proposed law . A Bill will become a law after it has been passed by both the \nupper and lower houses of parliament and assented to by the Crown. The main types of \nBills are the following.\nGovernment Bills\nA government Bill is a Bill that has been approved by the Cabinet. These Bills are \nintroduced either as a result of government policy or after recommendations put forward by government departments or other bodies, such as parliamentary committees, law reform commissions or interest groups in the community . (A Bill concerned with government policy is sometimes referred to as a public Bill.)\nThe majority of legislation introduced into parliament re\ufb02  ects the needs of the \ngovernment departments. As the government represents the majority in the lower house, a Bill with Cabinet support will usually be passed by parliament. Government Bills include fi  nancial Bills, such as the budget, which provide for government spending.\nWHAT IS CABINET ?\nAt a Federal level, Cabinet consists of the Prime \nMinister and ministers. At a State level, Cabinet consists of the Premier and ministers. Cabinet plays an important role in the legislative process. The law-making policies of the government are decided at Cabinet meetings. Cabinet will also decide the order in which proposed changes in the law will be presented to parliament. It offi  cially approves legislation to be introduced by the government.\nCabinet is not formally recognised by the \nConstitution. The role of Cabinet in the making of laws comes from parliamentary convention. Parliamentary conventions are unwritten rules about how parliament operates that have developed over time.\nCabinet has extensive resources to determine \nthe need for change in the law . It receives advice from various committees. When Cabinet approves a Bill, it will appoint a minister to be responsible for the passage of the Bill through parliament. When the government holds the majority in both houses of parliament, the Cabinet has a powerful in\ufb02  uence. In\u00a0this situation, a Bill approved by Cabinet will receive the support of the majority of members in both houses.\nPrivate members\u2019 Bills\nAny member of parliament can introduce a Bill without Cabinet support. A Bill may be \nintroduced by a member of the opposition or by a government backbencher. These Bills \nare known as private members\u2019 Bills.\nPrivate members\u2019 Bills are usually unsuccessful. Generally , members of parliament \nare members of a political party and will vote according to their party\u2019s policies. Private members\u2019 Bills that have been introduced by the opposition are usually defeated, as members of the party in government will often vote against the proposition. A private member\u2019s Bill introduced by a government backbencher may encounter similar problems.\nPrivate Bills\nSometimes it is necessary to pass a Bill that affects only a small proportion of the community .\nThese are known as private Bills and they are usually passed without opposition. For \nexample, the Uniting Church in Australia Act 1977 (Cth) affects only one section of the Australian community .\nDrafting legislation\nDrafting is a process of framing legislation in the form of a Bill. The Parliamentary Counsel (the offi  cial parliamentary draftsperson) is a public servant and\u00a0lawyer who is responsible for drafting legislation.\nThe minister responsible for the introduction of a Bill, or the relevant government \ndepartment, will brief the Parliamentary Counsel on the requirements of the Bill. The counsel will draft a Bill based on this advice.A Bill is a proposed law. \nBills may be government Bills, private members\u2019 Bills or private Bills.\nMost Bills are government Bills, which therefore already have the support of Cabinet.\nA private member\u2019s Bill may be introduced by any member of parliament; it has not been endorsed by/uni00A0Cabinet.\nBills are drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel\u2019s Of/f_i  ce.

  "Page 296": "NEWSREPORT  8.1 \nWhere do new laws come from?\nTECHNICALLY , MOST OF OUR LEGISLATION COMES  \nfrom the government. Government Bills have the \napproval of/uni00A0the Cabinet.\nReasons for change\nThere are many factors that may in/f_l  uence a change in the law. One important in/f_l  uence is the policies of the political party in government. These policies form a \u2018to do list\u2019 of the promises made at election time. Furthermore, a minister may have a personal commitment to a particular issue. In this case the minister may press for changes to be made.\nAlternatively, a minister may respond to a perceived \nproblem referred to them by their department. This may involve consultation with a law reform body, public servants or outside bodies headed by academics, judges or experts in a particular /f_i  eld. Public servants who are responsible for the administration of laws may /f_i  nd that when administering a particular law there are administrative di\ufb03   culties, or public dissatisfaction, or unexpected consequences. They may put a proposal to the minister for a change in the law.\nDecisions made by judges when hearing cases \nrequiring the interpretation of the law may also in/f_l  uence a change. Ministers, their sta\ufb00   or public servants may have been lobbied by groups and individuals in the community for changes in the law to address particular concerns. Some changes in the law will result from a combination of/uni00A0these in/f_l  uences.\nDrafting legislation\nOnce a decision to change the law or to introduce a new law has been made, a Bill must be written. This is called drafting legislation. The Parliamentary Counsel, who is a lawyer trained in this particular area, usually does this. The Parliamentary Counsel heads a team \u2013 the legislative drafting o\ufb03   ce, which is attached to a parliament.\nThe Parliamentary Counsel aims to write legislation \nthat is clear, precise, unambiguous and easy to read. The/uni00A0legislation will impose new rules that tell people what/uni00A0they can and cannot do, and what the penalties are for breaching those rules. The legislation will also stipulate people\u2019s rights, duties and obligations in relation to those new rules.\nImpact of errors\nThe Parliamentary Counsel strives to prepare legislation that is error-free. Errors made in drafting a legislative document may have immediate and direct results. An/uni00A0error in a law providing social security bene/f_i  ts may deny people a bene/f_i  t the law meant them to be entitled to. An ambiguity in a conveyancing law, for instance, may cause disputes and delay the transfer of residential property. An unclear, imprecise law will confuse people governed by it and lead/uni00A0to costly and time-consuming court cases to interpret/uni00A0it.\nThe drafting process\nThe drafting process usually starts with instructions being given to the Parliamentary Counsel. This process may start with a phone conversation or oral instructions. In most situations, instructions will be given in written form, setting out the details of what the proposed Bill aims to achieve. The Parliamentary Counsel will need to work through the instructions and analyse them from a number of di\ufb00  erent points of view, including the following:\n\u2022 What is the law trying to achieve?\u2022 Does parliament have the power to make the law?\u2022 What are the possible legislative options?\u2022 Are there any gaps?\u2022 Are there any other matters that need to be \nconsidered, such as the relationship between the proposal and existing legislation?\nHowever, time restrictions can often limit the ability of the Parliamentary Counsel to consider all aspects. Often the drafting process is hurried. This is partly because of the workload of individual drafters and partly because legislation often needs to be written quickly after policy decisions have been made.\nActivity 8.1  Folio exercise\nDrafting legislation\nRead \u2018Where do new laws come from?\u2019 and complete the following tasks:\n1 Why are most changes in the law in the form of government Bills?\n2 Brie/f_l  y outline the factors that may in/f_l  uence a change in the law.\n3 Parliamentary Counsels, who are experts in drafting laws, write proposed laws.

  "Page 298": "Table 8.1 The legislative process\nLower House\nIntroduction and \n/f_i  rst readingThe /f_i  rst reading is the Bill\u2019s formal introduction. The member must present the Bill \nto the house. The title is read out. There is no discussion or debate. Copies are circulated to all members of the house. The contents of the Bill are made known. At/uni00A0this time the Bill may move immediately to the second reading or a future date for the second reading is set.\nSecond reading At the second reading, the minister will deliver a speech explaining the main purpose of the Bill. The minister then presents an explanatory memorandum to the house. The explanatory memorandum includes the reasons for the Bill and outlines its main provisions. Further debate on the Bill may be deferred and a time set for the continuation of the second reading. This allows time to study the Bill, as well as/uni00A0the opportunity for public discussion or reaction.\nWhen the debate resumes, the opposition, usually represented by a shadow \nminister, will outline their response to the Bill. The government and opposition will then take turns to speak either for or against the Bill. It is important to note that the opposition does not oppose all Bills.\nAt the end of the debate the house will vote either for or against the continuation \nof the Bill. The second reading debate is usually the most substantial debate, as it is when the general principles and the reasons for and against the Bill are discussed.\nConsideration in \nDetailHaving accepted the main purpose of the Bill, the house may consider it in detail. \nThe deputy speaker takes the speaker\u2019s place. The house is now said to be in Consideration in Detail. The deputy speaker proposes each clause of the Bill to the/uni00A0house for agreement. Discussion and amendment may occur.\nWhen the considerations are completed, the speaker again takes the chair. \nThe house resumes sitting and the deputy speaker reports that the Bill has been adopted with or without amendment. In some instances, the house may agree that the Bill does not need to be considered in detail \u2013 this stage is not compulsory. When a Bill is not controversial, the house may agree to bypass this stage and go directly to the third reading.\nThe Senate and the Legislative Council refer to this stage as Committee of \nthe/uni00A0Whole.\nThird reading The house will formally accept or reject the Bill as reported (presented). This report will include any amendments agreed to during the Consideration in Detail. There may be some further debate. However, the third reading is usually a formality in the lower house, as the government always has a majority in the lower house, and the government introduces most Bills. The house will vote for or against the Bill at the completion of the third reading.\nUpper House\nWhen the Bill has been passed in the lower house, it is sent to the upper house. The Bill will go through the three reading stages in the upper house. When the Bill has passed the upper house, it is returned to the lower house, either with or without amendment. Both houses must approve amendments in identical/uni00A0form.\nThe upper house can reject a Bill passed by the lower house. When there are disagreements, messages \nmay pass between the two houses so that an agreement can be reached about the provisions in the Bill. If/uni00A0no agreement can be reached, the Bill may be \u2018laid aside\u2019, meaning that no further action is taken.\nCrown\nRoyal assent The /f_i  nal stage in the legislative process is known as royal assent. When both houses have passed a Bill, it is presented to the Crown by the initiating minister. The/uni00A0Crown will act on the advice of the Executive Council to give royal assent. Once/uni00A0a Bill receives royal assent it becomes an Act. An Act will come into forceon a/uni00A0date set in the Act or on a date proclaimed by the Crown.\nWhen will the Act come into force?\nSometimes the whole Act commences at the same time, but at other times different \nparts commence at different times. If no commencement date is specifi  ed, the Act will commence 28 days after it receives the royal assent.\nProclamation\nProclamation means that the date for the commencement of the Act may be announced (proclaimed) by the Crown in the Government Gazette. Proclamations can be made for a number of reasons. A proclamation can be used to set the date for the commencement of an Act or parts of an Act.Once a Bill receives royal \nassent it will come into force either on a date set in the Act or on a date proclaimed by the Crown. 290  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 299": "ARE HUMAN RIGHTS  PROTECTED IN \nLAW-MAKING?\nIn Victoria, the impact of laws on human rights \nmust be considered as part of the legislative process. The Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities requires that a \u2018statement of compatibility\u2019 must be presented to parliament before\u00a0the second reading speech.\nThe statement of compatibility must state \neither\u00a0that:\n \u00b7the Bill is compatible with the human rights in the Charter, and explain how; or\n \u00b7parts of the Bill are not compatible with human rights, and explain the nature and extent of the incompatibility .The statement of compatibility ensures that ministers take responsibility for the human rights impact of proposed laws.\nThe Commonwealth parliament also considers \nthe impact of laws on human rights. A statement of compatibility is prepared for any Bill introduced into a house of the Commonwealth parliament. The statement assesses whether the Bill is compatible with human rights contained in a range of international human rights agreements that Australia is a signatory to.\nThe statement of compatibility is presented to \nparliament at the same time as the Explanatory Memorandum for the Bill.\n8.3   Factors affecting law-making \nby parliament\nThe primary role of parliament is to make laws. Parliament can make laws to remedy \nexisting problems or in anticipation of future problems.\nIt is clearly stated in section 1 of the Australian Constitution that the legislative power \nof the Commonwealth shall be vested in the Commonwealth parliament. Within the restrictions of the Constitution, the Commonwealth parliament has the ultimate power to make law .\nSimilarly , section 15 of the Victorian Constitution states that \u2018the legislative power of \nthe State of Victoria shall be vested in a Parliament \u2026 to be known as the Parliament of Victoria\u2019. The Victorian Constitution gives general powers to the Victorian parliament to make laws for Victoria. The Australian Constitution specifi  cally takes away some of these powers by giving them exclusively to the Commonwealth parliament.\nProvided that the Victorian parliament is making laws within these constitutional limits, \nit also has the ultimate power to make laws for the state of Victoria.\nThe roles of the houses\nThe bicameral structure of the parliament contributes to the representative nature of \nparliament as a law-maker. The lower house represents the will of the majority of people. The upper house provides equal representation for each State or Territory (or region, in Victoria). In theory , this means that a range of interests is represented in the law-making\u00a0process.\nSUPREMACY  OF PARLIAMENT\nThe term \u2018supremacy of parliament\u2019 (also called the \u2018sovereignty of parliament\u2019) \nrefers to the idea that parliament is the supreme or ultimate authority in the nation and that Acts of Parliament will override other forms of rule. Providing it is acting within its constitutional powers, parliament can make, amend or repeal law . Laws made by parliament:\n \u00b7cannot be overruled by a court (but can be interpreted)\n \u00b7override delegated legislation.The bicameral structure of \nparliament provides for a representative law-making process.

  "Page 300": "Impact of party politics\nParliament may not provide a forum for debate that re\ufb02  ects the public\u2019s best interests \nbecause it is dominated by party politics. Members of parliament may represent the views of their political parties rather than their electorates.\nRole of the upper house\nMost Bills are government Bills. These usually originate in the lower house. As government is formed by the political party with a majority of seats in the lower house, government Bills will be passed by the lower house. However, the government may not have a majority of seats in the upper house. The upper house can act as a check on the actions of the lower house. One of its essential roles is to review legislative proposals.\nIf the majority party in the lower house controls the upper house, the upper house may \nnot act to review the legislative process. In this situation, the upper house may in effect become a \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 \u2013 a body that approves government Bills automatically .\nAlternatively , if the government does not have suffi  cient support in the upper house, \nlegislation may not be passed. The upper house may act to frustrate the legislative program of the government and block the passage of legislation.\nRepresentative nature of parliament\nParliament is an elected and representative body . The system is based on the idea that elected members represent the will of the majority of people, and therefore that the laws made by parliament re\ufb02  ect the will and the values of the majority of people. For instance, there has been growing concern in the community about family violence. Laws to implement the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Family Violence passed with bipartisan support. This means that both the opposition and the government supported these laws.Members of parliament \nmay represent the views of their political parties rather than their electorates.\nThe upper house may act as \u2018a rubber stamp\u2019 or may block legislation.\nParliament is democratically elected to/uni00A0represent the will of the/uni00A0majority.\nNEWSREPORT  8.2 \nBipartisan support for action on family violence\nTHE VICTORIAN ROYAL COMMISSION INTO FAMILY VIOLENCE WAS ESTABLISHED ON 22/uni00A0FEBRUARY 2015 . \nThe/uni00A0Commission was established in response to concerns about/uni00A0a series of family violence-related deaths in \nVictoria, and included a growing/uni00A0awareness of the scale of family violence and that existing policies had been ine\ufb00  ective in reducing the prevalence and severity of the violence.\nThe Royal Commission delivered \nits /f_i  nal report to the Governor on 29/uni00A0March 2016.

  "Page 301": "Resources to determine the will of the/uni00A0majority\nParliament has the resources and expertise necessary to ascertain the views of the \ncommunity and the need for a change in the law . The parliament can form committees, working parties and special bodies to prepare recommendations for legislative action to fulfi  l the needs of the community . Legislation is often the result of lengthy inquiries, reports from law reform bodies, or investigations. These processes help parliament make laws that re\ufb02  ect the values of the community . However, these investigations can be time-consuming and costly .\nDebates represent the will of the people\nThe legislative process has many stages. This means that members can be informed \nabout community views towards proposed changes. This also means that the laws passed by\u00a0parliament have fully considered the views of the community .\nHowever, the legislative process can be time-consuming and parliament must be \nsitting in order for it to make laws.\nDelays in law-making\nMembers of parliament may sometimes delay passing a Bill to allow time for public response and debate. Pressure groups provide feedback via representations to ministers,\u00a0other community members and groups write letters to parliamentarians and newspapers and express their views on social media, opinion polls may be conducted, and sometimes there is direct action, such as protest rallies.\nAs parliament is an elected and representative body , members of parliament are \nsensitive to public opinion and are, in general, careful not to alienate voters by passing legislation that is not popular. If members of parliament pass laws that do not represent the\u00a0views of the community , they may lose their seats at the next election.\nWHAT IS REPRESENTATIVE AND \nRESPONSIBLE  GOVERNMENT?\nThe idea of representative government is central to democracy . Representative \ngovernment refers to a government that represents the views of the majority of\u00a0people.\nGovernment is formed from an elected and representative body . Members of the \ngovernment come from the party with a majority of members elected to the lower house of parliament. This system aims to ensure that the government represents the views of the majority of people. If members of the government fail to represent the interests of the community , they will not be re-elected to parliament. \nThe idea of responsible government is also crucial to a democracy . Responsible \ngovernment means that government is answerable to the parliament, and therefore to the people. There are a number of ways in which government is responsible. Ministerial responsibility provides that ministers must answer to the parliament for the actions of their departments.\nPolitical pressures\nA number of kinds of political pressure may affect the ability of parliament to make laws. \nAs noted above, changes in the law may be the result of the policies of the political party in government or the needs of government departments.\nGovernment policies\nThe majority of proposed laws are government Bills. During elections, political parties present to the community a range of political policies. If a party is elected to government, these policies form the basis of their legislative program \u2013 the changes that they will implement. These proposed changes will be introduced with the support of Cabinet. This\u00a0means that these Bills will be supported by the government members.Parliament has the \nresources and expertise to/uni00A0determine the will of the majority.\nThe legislative process ensures that the views of the community about proposed changes in the law are heard.\nParliament can only change the law when it/uni00A0is/uni00A0sitting.

The proposal would be passed on to the minister in charge of the government department. The minister will then raise the issue with Cabinet and seek support to propose a change in the law .\nNEWSREPORT  8.3 \nWhy introduce a private member\u2019s Bill?\nSINCE FEDERATION, ONLY 28 NON/hyphen.capGOVERNMENT  \nBills have been passed by the Commonwealth \nparliament. The opportunity to introduce private members\u2019 Bills is limited. The government controls the parliamentary agenda and the timing of when legislation can be/uni00A0introduced.\nUnsuccessful Bills can still serve a valuable purpose. \nA private member\u2019s Bill may deal with a topic which the government opposes. The introduction of the private member\u2019s Bill will potentially force the government to debate the issue, thus raising public awareness around the issue. Sometimes the aim may be to attract media attention to the issue. Sometimes private members\u2019 Bills deal with highly controversial issues, such as same-sex marriage or euthanasia. For instance, on 12 September 2016, Adam Bandt, Cathy McGowan and Andrew Wilkie introduced the Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2016 [No. 2] into the House of Representatives. This Bill proposed to amend the Marriage Act 1961 (Cth) to \u2018allow couples to marry, and to have their marriages recognised, regardless of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or/uni00A0intersex status\u2019 . The Bill was withdrawn from the Notice Paper in 2017. Later that year the Marriage Law Postal Survey asked Australians for their views on/uni00A0same-sex marriage.\nWhere the issue is highly controversial the \ngovernment may be wary of possible electoral backlash if they endorse the Bill.\nSometimes the vote on a private member\u2019s Bill \nwill be a conscience vote. In other words, individual members of parliament will be free to vote as individuals, not according to their party policies. Therefore, private members\u2019 Bills allow members of parliament to vote according to the values of their electorates.\nOther political pressures\nOther political pressures that affect the law-making role of parliament include lobbying \nby individuals and groups in the community . In theory , parliament re\ufb02  ects the will of the majority of people. However, where there are strongly opposing views in the community , parliament may not be able to determine the will of the majority and therefore be unable to act. The impact of individuals and groups (including the media) on parliament\u2019s ability to make laws will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 10. 294  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 303": "The legislative process is dominated by government through the Cabinet. While it may \nbe argued that Cabinet, like the government, needs to act in the interests of the majority \nof the people, it may sometimes fail to act in this way due to particular electoral pressures. This is particularly evident with highly controversial issues, such as euthanasia, abortion or marriage equality . On the other hand, members of parliament who ignore the demand to change unpopular laws may suffer the consequences at election time.\nABORTION LAWS SLOW \nTO\u00a0CHANGE\nIn the 1960s, section 65 of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) clearly prohibited \u2018unlawful\u2019 \nabortion. In 1969, Justice Menhennitt interpreted \u2018unlawful\u2019 to mean any abortion that is not performed in good faith to preserve the mental or physical wellbeing of\u00a0the mother (R v Davidson [1969] VR 667). Despite an outcry from both pro- andanti-abortion groups, parliament was slow to revise or amend this legislation. It\u00a0wasn\u2019t until 2008 that the Abortion Law Reform Act (Vic) removed most provisions about abortion from the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic).Parliament may be \nreluctant to act on controversial issues due to/uni00A0electoral pressures.\nRestrictions on law-making powers\nParliament is the supreme law-making body . The Commonwealth parliament has the \npower to make laws in relation to the exclusive powers stated in the Constitution. Section 109 recognises the supremacy of the Commonwealth parliament in relation to concurrent areas of law . The State parliaments can exercise both residual and concurrent law-making powers. If a State parliament makes a law which con\ufb02  icts with a valid Commonwealth law , the State law will be declared invalid to the extent of the inconsistency .\nIn a federal system both State and Commonwealth parliaments are restricted in their \nlaw-making powers. The Commonwealth parliament is restricted to the law-making powers set out in the Constitution. Should the Commonwealth parliament make a law that is outside its constitutional powers, the law may be declared ultra vires (beyond their legal power and authority) and thus void. Provided that parliament is acting within its law-making powers, it is capable of undertaking comprehensive law reform.\nThe ability of parliament to make laws may also be affected by confusion about \nlaw-making responsibilities at the Federal and the State levels.For more information \nabout the division of law-making powers between the State and Commonwealth parliaments, see Chapter/uni00A07.\nThe ability of a parliament \nto make laws is restricted by its law-making powers under the Constitution.\nActivity 8.2  Multimedia report\nThe ability of parliament to make laws\nComplete a multimedia report on factors that affect the ability of parliament to make laws.

Legislation introduced without the support of Cabinet is unlikely to be successful.\n \u00b7The legislative process is dominated by the government, through the Cabinet.\n \u00b7Other political pressures that affect the law-making role of parliament include lobbying by individuals and groups in the community. Where there are strongly opposing views in the community, parliament may not be able to determine the will of the majority and therefore will not act.\n \u00b7Parliament may not legislate on politically sensitive issues, fearing electoral backlash.\nRestrictions on \nthe law-making powers \u00b7Parliament is the supreme law-making body, provided that it is making laws within its constitutional powers.\n \u00b7Parliament can make laws to comprehensively reform an area of law.\n \u00b7In a federal system, there may be some confusion about the law-making responsibilities of the \nCommonwealth and State parliaments.\nEnd-of-chapter questions\nRevision questions\n1 What is the difference between a government Bill and a private member\u2019s Bill?\n2 What is the role of the Parliamentary Counsel?\n3 Explain the role of Cabinet in the legislative process.\n4 How does the process used by parliament to make laws re\ufb02  ect the representative nature of parliament?\n5 Explain four factors that affect the ability of parliament to make laws.\nPractice exam questions\n1 Suggest one reason for most Bills being fi  rst introduced in the lower house.

It traces the development of judge-made law, the operation of the doctrine of precedent and the interpretation of statutes by judges. The roles of the Victorian courts and the High Court in law-making are examined, as are the reasons for, and the effects of, statutory interpretation. Factors that affect the ability of courts to make law are discussed.

  "Page 308": "9.1   What is the doctrine \nof\u00a0precedent?\nOne of the most important ways that the legal system achieves fairness is by making sure \nthat like cases are treated alike. The idea here is simple, and we see examples of it in everyday life. For example, imagine a teacher states that there will be no talking during class time, and enforces that rule with all students \u2013 except one. Allowing one student to talk while everyone else in the class may not is inconsistent, and unfair, and should not happen. Once a rule is set up, it should be applied to all students.\nIn the same way , it would be grossly unjust if the law about murder was applied to most \npeople, but not all. Those people who avoided a murder conviction might feel happy , but those who did not would be outraged \u2013 and society would be confused about whether murder was illegal or not. Instead of social cohesion, there would be disintegration.\nThe doctrine of precedent is simply a system used by courts to make sure that similar \ncases are dealt with in similar ways, in the interests of consistency and fairness.\nWhen a legal dispute arises, the courts are the place where it must be resolved. In \norder to make sure that each case is dealt with fairly (and consistently), courts will look to see if any previous case (that is, a precedent) has dealt with the same fact situation, and will apply that precedent to ensure consistency . (To enable courts to fi  nd precedents, judgments of courts are recorded in written reports called law reports.)\nThe doctrine (that is, system) of precedent grew out of the courts\u2019 role of adjudicating \ndisputes, and their desire to be fair in doing so.\nLaw created by courts using the doctrine of precedent is referred to as \u2018common law\u2019, \nprecedent or judge-made law .\n9.2   How did common \nlaw\u00a0develop?\nThe evolution of the common law can be traced back to the days of Anglo-Saxon England. \nBefore 1066, when the Normans under William the Conqueror invaded England, the \nSaxons had established a system of local courts throughout the country . These courts applied laws that consisted of a combination of local customs and laws made by the kings.\nA system of courts\nAfter the Norman Conquest, the Norman kings introduced a more centralised structure for government and the administration of justice. This evolved over many centuries. At fi  rst the Norman kings relied on the existing courts to administer justice, but they sent out their own offi  cials to preside over cases.\nThe role of these justices was mainly to collect taxes. They also had the responsibility \nfor settling minor disputes. They travelled around England collecting taxes and hearing disputes. These travelling justices became known as \u2018circuit\u2019 judges. Today , judges travelling to regional centres to hear cases are still referred to as being \u2018on circuit\u2019.\nBy the 12th century a network of king\u2019s courts had developed and the local courts \nbecame less important. A major advantage of taking a case to the king\u2019s court was that the decisions were more effectively enforced. The decisions of the king\u2019s court had the backing of the king\u2019s power.\nReferring to past decisions\nThe rulings and principles established by judges developed into a uniform system of law . The circuit judges would meet and compare the cases that they had heard throughout the country . They would discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the various local customs that they had experienced. Gradually , the judges began to replace the local customs they considered to be unfair with the customs applied in similar cases from Common law evolves from \ndecisions made by courts. 300  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 309": "other areas. As a result, a body of \u2018common customs\u2019 evolved. This provided for greater \nconsistency and certainty throughout England.\nThe law that was common throughout England became the law declared by judges. \nThe judges would look at previous cases to decide what the law should be. This process is known as precedent. The operation of the doctrine of precedent is a feature of the common law system.\nCommon law evolved from judges looking at previous cases to determine what \nthe law\u00a0should be. Each time a judge decides that an established rule applies to a new situation, the judge is using precedent. Other judges would apply the same legal principles in similar cases. This is different from the law made by parliament, which is found in Acts or\u00a0statutes.\nCommon law and statute law\nToday , many of the common law principles have been rewritten in statutes. Where there \nis a confl  ict between common law and statute law , statute law prevails. In other words, if common law says one thing and the statute law states something different, you must obey the statute law .\n9.3  Precedents\nA precedent is a reported judgment of a court that establishes a point of law . A judgment \nis a court decision. The judgment will include the reasons for the decision. The reasons for\u00a0the decision are known as the ratio decidendi. The judgments of courts are published in law reports.\nThe ratio decidendi forms the legal principle. These legal principles are used to \ndetermine later cases. The doctrine of precedent refers to rules used by the court to decide when they should use the legal principle established in a past case.\nNot all court judgments are reported. Only the decisions of the higher courts (known \nas \u2018courts of superior record\u2019) that involve new or signifi  cant issues of law are published in law reports. To determine what the law should be, lawyers and judges refer to the reports of past similar (or like) cases. In Australia, all courts in the court hierarchy from the\u00a0Supreme Court and above are courts of superior record.\nReported judgments\nTo understand how lawyers and judges use precedent, it is important to understand how \nto\u00a0read a reported case. When a case is reported, a full statement of the case is printed. This statement will include:\n\u2022 the names of the parties involved in the dispute\n\u2022 the name of the court and the year the case was heard\u2022 a summary of the facts\u2022 the arguments presented by both sides\u2022 the judgments of the judge/s \u2013 the reasons given by a judge, explaining and\njustifying the decision made\n\u2022 a decision inter partes \u2013 a decision in favour of one of the parties, specifying which\nparty won the case.\nRatio decidendi\nNot everything said by a judge (or judges) in the course of reaching a decision is a \nprecedent. Only the ratio decidendi forms the legal principle to be used in future cases.\nThe term ratio  decidendi means literally \u2018the reason for deciding\u2019. The ratio decidendi \nis the rule of law stated by the judge as the reason for deciding. According to the doctrine of precedent, in cases that have similar circumstances, the ratio decidendi of higher courts will be binding on all lower courts (in the same court hierarchy), when there are similar fact circumstances.Common law evolves \nthrough the application of the doctrine of precedent.\nIf common law and statute law con/f_l  ict, statute law prevails.\nA precedent is a reported judgment of a court that establishes a point of law.\nOnly reported decisions can form a precedent.\n Go to the Library \nsection of the High Court of Australia\u2019s website (http://www.hcourt.gov.au/library/about-the-library) for examples of recent judgments.\nThe ratio decidendi, or reason for deciding, forms the legal principle.Chapter 9 The role of the courts in law-making  301\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 310": "Obiter dictum\nA comment made by a judge that is on a question of law , but not directly relevant to \ndeciding the case, is an obiter dictum: a statement made \u2018by the way\u2019. A judge\u2019s statement \nor opinion in a judgment that is not part of the ratio decidendi (precedent) may be used as a persuasive argument in later cases.\nStare decisis\nStare decisis means \u2018to stand by what has been decided\u2019. Lower courts stand by , or follow , the decisions of the higher courts in \u2018like cases\u2019.\nThe rules relating to stare decisis can be summarised as follows:\n\u2022 Precedents can be set only by a higher court (usually when exercising an appellate \n\u2013 appeal \u2013 jurisdiction).\n\u2022 All lower courts are bound by the decisions of higher courts in the same hierarchy .\nFor instance, the Victorian County Court is bound by the decisions of the Victorian \nSupreme Court. Both courts are part of the Victorian court hierarchy . The Victorian County Court does not, however, have to follow a decision of the South Australian Supreme Court \u2013 the South Australian Supreme Court is not part of the Victorian court hierarchy . (A decision of a court from outside the hierarchy is \u2018persuasive\u2019 \u2013 it can be used as a convincing argument about what the law should be \u2013 but it is not\u00a0binding.)\n\u2022 Decisions of courts at the same level, or equal standing, are not binding. For \nexample, a judge of the Supreme Court may disagree with previous decisions of other judges in the Supreme Court. The previous decisions are seen as highly persuasive. By convention, a judge will follow a decision by an earlier judge in the same court. This convention is seen as providing for certainty and consistency . One\u00a0exception to this convention is the High Court (the highest court in Australia): it\u00a0is not bound by its own past decisions.\nBinding precedent\nA binding precedent is a legal principle that must be followed. The doctrine of precedent \ndepends on lower courts following the decisions of higher courts. The general rule is that a decision of a higher court in the same hierarchy is binding or must be followed by lower courts in the same hierarchy when deciding similar or \u2018like\u2019 cases. For instance, in Victoria a judge of the County Court must follow the decisions of judges in the Supreme Court. A\u00a0decision of the High Court is binding on all other Australian courts.\nObiter dicta, the plural \nof obiter dictum, are statements made that do not form a ratio decidendi but may be persuasive.\nStare decisis means to stand by what has been decided.\nA precedent made by a higher court that must be followed is a binding precedent. 302  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

On a day in late September 2004 at approximately 12.30pm, the appellant, Kathryn Strong, slipped and fell on a hot chip outside the Big W store, in an area for which Woolworths was responsible and close to a food court. Strong suffered a serious spinal injury as a result of her fall. At the time of the injury, Strong was already disabled, having had her right leg amputated above the knee, and walked with the aid of crutches. Strong\u2019s injury occurred when one of her crutches made contact with the hot chip.\nStrong brought proceedings for negligence against Woolworths in the District Court of NSW. \nAt /f_i  rst instance, Robison DCJ awarded Strong over $580,000 damages. On appeal, the NSW Court of Appeal (Campbell JA, Handley AJA and Harrison J) found that Strong had failed to prove that Woolworths\u2019 negligence was a cause of her injury: see Woolworths Ltd v Strong [2010]  \nNSWCA/uni00A0282.\nStrong appealed to the High Court of Australia.Held, per French CJ, Gummow, Crennan and Bell JJ (Heydon J dissenting), allowing the appeal:Per French CJ, Gummow, Crennan and Bell JJ:(i)   It was not necessary for Strong to point to evidence permitting an inference as to when the \nhot chip had been deposited on the /f_l  oor. It was suf/f_i  cient for Strong to prove that it was more \nprobable than not that Woolworths\u2019 negligence was a necessary condition of her fall.

The cleaning \ncompany did not increase the frequency of inspections during this time and the full-time cleaner took a lunchbreak during this time. Both of these facts tend against a /f_i  nding of an increased risk of injury during this period: at [36].\n(iii)   There was no evidentiary basis for the /f_i  nding that the hot chip was dropped shortly before \nStrong\u2019s accident. There was no evidentiary basis for the /f_i  nding that hot chips are more likely to be consumed at lunch rather than for breakfast or for a mid-morning snack.

They give an indication of what other judges think the law should be.\nPrecedent in action\nThe operation of the doctrine of precedent is\u00a0easier to understand by looking at examples. The case of Donoghue/uni00A0v/uni00A0Stevenson [1932] AC 562 is a signifi  cant case. In this case the fundamental legal principle of negligence\u00a0was\u00a0established.\nDonoghue v Stevenson\nA friend of Mrs Donoghue bought her a bottle of ginger beer. The beer was served in a dark, opaque bottle. Mrs\u00a0Donoghue had drunk about half the bottle of ginger beer before emptying what remained onto her ice-cream. As she did this, a partly decomposed snail fl  oated out of the bottle. Mrs Donoghue became ill. She suffered gastroenteritis and shock. She claimed that her illness was a direct result of consuming the ginger beer and seeing the decomposed snail.\nMrs Donoghue sued the manufacturer of the ginger beer. She claimed that they \nhad been negligent. Mrs\u00a0Donoghue could not bring an action under the law of contract because she was not a party to the contract. The\u00a0contract for the sale of the ginger beer had been formed between the manufacturer and Mrs Donoghue\u2019s friend. The defence counsel argued on behalf of the manufacturer that there was no duty of care because there was no contract between the manufacturer and Mrs Donoghue. A duty of care only applied to \u2018dangerous things\u2019. The ginger beer could not be considered a \u2018dangerous thing\u2019.A persuasive precedent \ndoes not have to be followed.

  "Page 313": "However, the House of Lords decided that Mrs Donoghue was entitled to be \ncompensated by the manufacturer. This case was the fi  rst case in which the House of \nLords decided that the manufacturer owed a duty of care to the ultimate consumer.\nThe basic legal principle of negligence is based on Lord Atkin\u2019s ratio decidendi:\nYou must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can \nreasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who, then, in law , is my neighbour? The\u00a0answer seems to be \u2013 persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or\u00a0omissions which are called into question.\nNEWSREPORT  9.1\nM\u2019Alister (or Donoghue) [Pauper] v Stevenson\nHouse of Lords [1932] AC 562\nTHE APPEAL WAS HEARD BY FIVE JUDGES OF THE  \nHouse of Lords. Lord Atkin summed up the majority/uni00A0view:\nThe liability for negligence, whether you style it \nsuch or treat it as in other systems as a species of  \n\u2018culpa\u2019  [blame], is no doubt based upon a general \npublic sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the o\ufb00  ender must pay \u2026 The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes, in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the lawyer\u2019s question, who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who, then, in law, is my neighbour? The answer seems to be \u2013 persons who are so closely and directly a\ufb00  ected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so a\ufb00  ected when I/uni00A0am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called into/uni00A0question. \n... [A] manufacturer of products, which he sells in \nsuch a form as to show that he intends them to reach the ultimate consumer in the form in which they left him, with no reasonable possibility of intermediate examination, and with the knowledge that the absence of reasonable care in the preparation or putting up of the products will result in an injury to the consumer\u2019s life or property, owes a duty to the consumer to take reasonable care \u2026 It is a proposition that I dare to say no one in Scotland or England who was not a lawyer would for one moment doubt. It will be an advantage to make it clear that the law in this matter, as in most others, is/uni00A0in accordance with sound common sense. I think that this appeal should be/uni00A0allowed.\nThe result was that by a \nmajority of 3:2, the Lords held that there was a valid cause of/uni00A0action.\nGrant v Australian Knitting Mills\nA later Australian case heard in the Privy Council, Grant v Australian Knitting Mills \n[1936] AC 85, involved similar circumstances. In this case the plaintiff, Dr Grant, bought some woollen underwear from a store. The underwear had been manufactured by the Australian Knitting Mills Ltd. Dr Grant suffered dermatitis as a result of wearing the woollen underwear. It was later discovered that the condition was caused by the excessive use of chemicals in the process used to make the underwear. Although not identical, this case can be seen as having similar circumstances to the earlier case of Donoghue v Stevenson.\nAccording to the doctrine of precedent, the court would have applied the rule of law \nstated in Donoghue v Stevenson to the case of Grant v Australian Knitting Mills. Like Mrs Donoghue, Dr Grant was deemed to be a \u2018neighbour\u2019. He was a person who was closely and directly affected by the act of the manufacturer and the manufacturer ought to have had him in mind as being affected when preparing the underwear. The manufacturer had a duty to take reasonable care to avoid acts that they could reasonably foresee would be likely to injure consumers such as Dr Grant.

An example is the case of Fuller-Lyons v New South Wales [2015] HCA 31.\nIn this case the State of New South Wales, as the \nlegal entity responsible for the operation of the rail network in NSW , was sued for negligence. In 2011, 8-year-old Corey Travis Fuller-Lyons fell from a train about 2 minutes after it had left the station. Although there was no evidence about how he fell from the train, he must have fallen through the front doors of the train carriage. These doors were fi  tted with locks that were centrally operated by the guard on the train. When these doors were locked, they could not be forced open. The primary judge found that the most likely explanation for the boy\u2019s having fallen out of the carriage was that he had been caught in the doors as they closed. This would have left at least part of his body out of the train as it left the station. The facts indicate that the boy fell from the train as it negotiated a bend at about 100 kilometres per hour.\nThe appellant successfully argued that the failure of \na railway employee to keep a proper lookout before signalling the guard that it was safe for a train to depart from a station was negligence. This left young Corey vulnerable to falling out of the moving train because the carriage door was not properly closed.\nThe State appealed to the Court of Appeal of \nthe Supreme Court of New South Wales against the fi  nding of liability . This case was successful but the subsequent appeal by Fuller-Lyons to the High Court of Australia reversed that decision.Hedley Byrne v Heller\nThe principles of Donoghue v Stevenson have been applied and extended to many other \ncases. For example, in the case of Hedley Byrne v Heller [1964] AC 465, the principles were extended to include liability for providing information and advice.\nIn this case a banker was asked by a creditor to provide information about the \ncreditworthiness of another person. The banker provided the information, stating that the individual in question had a good credit rating. On the basis of this information, credit was given. However, the loan was not repaid and the information supplied by the bank was found to be incorrect. The creditor sued the banker but was unsuccessful. Although the court agreed that a duty of care was owed, the banker had clearly stated that the advice was given \u2018without responsibility on the part of the bank or its offi  cials\u2019.\nThe court found in favour of the banker. The court also stated that if the banker had not \nmade the disclaimer, the banker would have been found liable. (A disclaimer is a statement that you will not be responsible. In this case, the disclaimer stated that the bank would not be responsible for the information.) The court based this decision on the fact that a \u2018special relationship\u2019 existed between the person giving the statement and the person relying on the statement. The banker owed a duty of care to the creditor. This case provided the basis for many cases about the giving of special expert advice in a particular area. It applies to advice given by doctors, lawyers, fi  nancial advisers and other\u00a0professionals. 306  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 315": "9.4  Flexibility and precedents\nAs we have already discussed, the doctrine of precedent means that lower courts rely \non the decisions of higher courts to decide what the law should be. This may give the \nimpression that the law , once stated by a court, can never be changed or modifi  ed. This is not true. There are a number of approaches that judges can take to ensure that the law avoids injustices and keeps pace with the changing needs and values of society .\nFollowing\nWhen a subsequent court uses a precedent, it is said to be \u2018following\u2019 the previous decision. Lawyers also refer to this as seeing a precedent being \u2018applied\u2019 to a later case.\nReversing\nWhere a higher court hears a case on appeal and decides that the lower court which had heard the case had decided the case wrongly , it will reverse the decision. The ratio decidendi of the lower court is no longer valid. It is replaced by the ratio decidendi of the higher court. Examples of reversing are Strong v Woolworths and Fuller-Lyons v New South Wales.\nCAR THEFT  \u2013 \nA JOINT ENTERPRISE?\nAnother example of a decision being reversed on appeal occurred in a case \ninvolving the theft of a motor vehicle and subsequent accident. In this case, it was claimed that the driver owed a duty of care to the passenger who had jointly stolen the car that had been driven.\nIn Miller v Miller [2011] HCA 9, 16-year-old Danelle Miller had been drinking, \nand unsuccessfully tried to enter a nightclub. Having been refused entry , she decided to steal a car to get home. She did steal a car, and then she asked her older sister, Narelle (who was unlicensed and had also been drinking), to drive her younger cousin and herself home. Maurin (aged 27), Narelle\u2019s uncle, was at a taxi rank and saw Narelle begin to drive off. He stopped her and said he would drive. Some of Maurin\u2019s friends also got into the car. In total, there were nine passengers crammed in the car, with Maurin driving. When Maurin began to speed and drive erratically , Danelle asked him to stop and let her out. He did not. Later, when the car slowed down, Danelle again asked Maurin to stop and let her out. Maurin ignored her requests to get out of the car.\nShortly afterwards Maurin lost control of the car and it struck a pole. One \npassenger was killed. Danelle was very seriously injured. She sued Maurin in the West Australian District Court for negligence, and won that case. However, on appeal to the Court of Appeal of Western Australia, the court concluded that Maurin did not owe Danelle a duty of care because Maurin and Danelle had engaged in a joint illegal enterprise, being the illegal use of a motor car. On appeal to the Full Court of the High Court, the Court reversed this decision. It held that Danelle had withdrawn from that joint enterprise when she asked to be allowed to get out of the\u00a0car:\nBecause Danelle had withdrawn from, and was no longer participating in, the \ncrime of illegally using the car when the accident happened, it could no longer be said that Maurin owed her no duty of care. That he owed her no duty earlier in the journey is not the point. When he ran off the road, he owed a passenger, who was not then complicit in the crime which he was then committing, a duty to take reasonable care.\nThe High Court concluded, therefore, that the orders of the Court of Appeal of the \nSupreme Court of Western Australia be set aside, and the appeal to the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court be dismissed.The processes of \nreversing, overruling, distinguishing and disapproving allow for /f_l  exibility in precedent.

  "Page 316": "Overruling\nA case may come before a higher court that relies on a legal principle that has been set \nin an earlier (and different) case decided in a lower court. The judge presiding in the higher court may believe that that other earlier case has been wrongly decided and the higher court would not follow the decision made by the lower court. When a higher court decides not to follow the decision of a lower court in a previous case, the higher court is overruling the earlier decision.\nReversing and overruling are different processes in that overruling a case requires two \nseparate cases. (A decision being reversed involves one case that is subject to an appeal to a higher court.)\nDisapproving\nCourts at the same level are not bound by each other\u2019s decisions. Where a judge in a court refuses to follow an earlier decision of another judge at the same level, that judge are said to have disapproved the other decision. In other words, they have demonstrated that their opinion of the law differs from that of the judge in the earlier case. This may result in an appeal to a higher court to determine what the law should be.\nDistinguishing\nCourts are bound only by the decisions of higher courts in similar cases. Where the facts of a case are suffi  ciently different from those in a previous case, the decision in the previous case will not be considered binding. Of course, no two cases are exactly the same. Provided a judge is satisfi  ed that the facts of the new case are suffi  ciently different from the earlier one so that it would be unjust to apply the earlier precedent, then the precedent will be \u2018distinguished\u2019. This is an appropriate way to avoid using the earlier precedent. The judge may decide the new case by formulating a new precedent. This process allows for the continued development of the common law to meet new situations.Lower courts can also \ndisapprove a binding precedent. However, they are bound to apply the precedent.\nActivity 9.1  Folio exercise\nExplaining the doctrine of precedent\n1 De/f_i  ne precedent.

  "Page 317": "  Legal brief 9.1 \nThe chip, the slip and the trip to court\nAt about 12.30 pm on 24 September 2004, the plaintiff, \nMs Strong, was browsing at a shopping centre with her daughter and a friend. The plaintiff walked with the aid of crutches after having had her right leg amputated above the knee a number of years earlier. Unfortunately for her, as she browsed an area out the front of the local Big W store (owned by Woolworths, the defendant), her right crutch lost its grip when it came into contact with a greasy chip on the ground. The plaintiff slipped and fell heavily, injuring her spine severely.\nThe plaintiff sued the defendant for negligence in the \nDistrict Court of NSW, arguing that she fell because the defendant failed to have a system to regularly clean the area, causing the chip to become a hazard. The District Court found for the plaintiff and awarded over $580,000 in damages.\nThe defendant appealed to the NSW Court of Appeal. \nThe defendant did not deny that reasonable care required that they inspect and clean the area at regular intervals \u2013 say every 20 minutes. But the defendant then argued that the plaintiff had not proved that the defendant\u2019s failure to have such a system had caused her injury. The reason? The plaintiff had not proved the chip had been on the ground longer than 20 minutes.\nThe Court of Appeal agreed with the defendant, \nholding that there was no evidence the chip had been on the ground long enough for the defendant to have removed it if the defendant had been inspecting the area every 20 minutes. The evidence that would have helped the plaintiff here included things like the chip being dirty, or no longer hot.\nThe plaintiff appealed this decision to the Full Court \nof the High Court.\nThe facts in detail\nThe defendant\u2019s store was very close to a food court in a shopping centre, similar to many other shopping centres. The defendant was running a pot plant sale in the area just outside the entrance of its store, with two racks of plants on display. The plaintiff, her daughter and her friend were browsing in this area, and as the plaintiff approached the pot plants on her right, the tip of her crutch slipped out from underneath her after coming into contact with the chip.\nAs noted above, the defendant had no speci/f_i  c system \nin place to ensure inspection and cleaning of the pot plant sale area. However, the defendant did not deny that it was responsible for ensuring the safety of those in the area.\nThe defendant\u2019s argument: the plaintiff hasn\u2019t \nproved our failure to clean caused the injury\nElsewhere in the centre, the owner of the centre was \nresponsible for inspecting and cleaning. It had hired a cleaning company to ensure that common area /f_l  oors were kept clean of rubbish, and inspected and cleaned at intervals of no more than 15 minutes. The defendant admitted that the system used by the owner of the centre could be used as evidence of what was reasonable care.\nBut the defendant argued that the plaintiff had not \nproved that the failure to clean regularly had caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury. Lawyers call this \u2018proving causation\u2019. The defendant said that in order to prove causation, the plaintiff needed to provide some proof that the chip had been on the ground for longer than 15 minutes, which was the maximum wait between cleanings that the defendant should have provided. Since the accident happened at about 12.30pm, the defendant effectively argued that the chip had most likely been dropped less than 15 minutes earlier. Even if the defendant had been cleaning the area every 15 minutes, this newly dropped chip would still have been there. Thus, the defendant\u2019s breach was not the cause of the injury to the plaintiff.\nThe decision\nA majority of the High Court (French CJ, Gummow, Crennan and Bell JJ) rejected the defendant\u2019s argument, and decided in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe majority spent some time considering the correct \ninterpretation of NSW legislation on the question of causation, but concluded that the real question in the case was about whether the plaintiff had provided enough proof to show the defendant\u2019s breach had caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury.\nOn that point, the majority rejected the defendant\u2019s \nargument that the plaintiff had to prove the chip had been put on the ground earlier than 20 minutes before her fall. Instead, the matter depended on considering the probabilities. If there was no evidence that the chip had been dropped at a particular point in time, the probability was that it was dropped in the /f_i  rst half of the/uni00A0day, rather than the 20 minutes before the plaintiff/uni00A0fell.\nThere was no evidence that the chip had been \ndropped less than 20 minutes before the accident, or at any other particular time of day. Although the incident had occurred at lunchtime, the Court felt the evidence pointed to the chip having been dropped much earlier:\nReasonable care required inspection and removal \nof slipping hazards at intervals not greater than 20 minutes in the sidewalk sales area, which was adjacent to the food court \u2026 The probabilities favoured the conclusion that the chip was deposited in the longer period between 8.00am and 12.10pm and not the shorter period between 12.10pm and the time of/uni00A0the fall \u2026\nOn that basis, the Court reversed the decision of the \nCourt of Appeal and restored the damages awarded to the plaintiff in the District Court.

  "Page 319": "9.5  Interpreting past decisions\nFollowing the development of legal principles through the decisions of judges in earlier \ncases can be diffi  cult. Determining which precedent, if any , applies in a particular case is part of the expertise and analytical skill required of the legal profession. It is the role of lawyers to present to the court the principles which they believe support their arguments and case. It is the role of the judge to determine how these arguments apply to the facts of\u00a0the case.\nThere are several reasons for it being diffi  cult to determine how a precedent \u2013 or \nwhich precedent \u2013 will apply to a case. As we have already seen, precedent is based on the concept that judges will follow the past decisions of judges in higher courts in reported cases. However, fi  nding the relevant cases from the large number of reported cases can be diffi  cult.\nProblems in interpreting past decisions include the following.\n\u2022 Locating relevant cases: Over time, there may have been numerous cases relating \nto a particular area of law . A lawyer may have failed to fi  nd all the relevant cases or a particularly signifi  cant case where the facts in question are crucial.\n\u2022 Identifying relevant ratio decidendi: Even when the relevant cases have all been located, identifying the ratio decidendi can also be problematic. Reported cases often involve complex arguments. The judgment may contain many comments about the facts of the case, references to other cases, and statements about general propositions of law as well as the reasons for deciding. It may be diffi  cult to determine what is obiter dictum and what is the ratio decidendi.\n\u2022 Cases with more than one ratio decidendi: Precedents are often established by courts hearing appeals. In these cases, the court will be presided over by three, fi  ve or even seven judges. While the judges may agree on the fi  nal outcome of the case, each judge may have a different reason for deciding. In such cases each judge prepares a statement of their own reasons for deciding and there may be multiple rationes decidendi. This makes it very diffi  cult to decide which fundamental principle of law in the reported case will apply to future cases.\nMANY REASONS \u2013 SAME\u00a0CONCLUSION\nThe case of Smith v Jenkins [1970] HCA 2 was \nreferred to in the High Court case of Miller v Miller [2011] HCA 9. Both cases concerned a driver and passenger in a car accident and the illegal use of a vehicle, and negligence was an issue. In Smith v Jenkins the High Court concluded, unanimously , that the plaintiff could not recover damages from the driver of the motor vehicle where both plaintiff and driver were illegally using a motor vehicle at the time of the accident. Each member of the Court gave\u00a0separate reasons.In this case three of the fi  ve Justices commented:\n \u00b7Chief Justice Barwick rested his conclusion on there being no duty of care owed by one illegal user to\u00a0another.\n \u00b7In the opinion of Justice Kitto, the important consideration was that the actual act done negligently was itself the criminal act in which both plaintiff and defendant were engaged.\n \u00b7Justice Owen stated that the relationship between two criminals engaged in carrying out a criminal venture gave rise to no duty of care owed by one to the other \u2018in the execution of the\u00a0crime\u2019.\n\u2022 Dissenting judgments: In some instances, one or more judges may dissent or \ndisagree with the fi  nal decision. The dissenting judges prepare a statement of their reasons for dissenting. Where there is more than one judgment it is even more diffi  cult to determine what the relevant law is.\n\u2022 Determining what is a like case: Of course no two cases are exactly alike. There may be a number of factual and legal similarities between a case currently being considered and past cases, but each case also has things that distinguish it from earlier cases. It may be diffi  cult to determine the extent to which the specifi  c facts of a case can be generalised to fi  t a category that would give rise to a Problems in using \nprecedent include locating the relevant cases, identifying the ratio/uni00A0decidendi, determining what is a like/uni00A0case and checking for/uni00A0con/f_l  icting decisions.

  "Page 321": "9.6  Statutory interpretation\nThe role of a court is to apply the law to resolve disputes. As well as applying common \nlaw to resolve a case, courts may also need to apply statutes, or Acts of Parliament. \nJudges\u00a0must interpret the words of an Act when a case comes before the court in which the intention or the meaning of words used is disputed. This is called statutory interpretation. By doing this, judges are often involved in clarifying what is the law .\nThe English language is very complex. This is particularly true of its legal terminology . \nActs of Parliament can be diffi  cult to understand. Attempts are being made to simplify the language used so that the average person can more easily understand it. However, judges may still need to interpret Acts of Parliament. Even lawyers and judges fi  nd that the\u00a0language used in Acts is confusing. In many instances there is argument about what the words and phrases mean. The easiest way to understand how judges interpret statutes is to look at an example. Consider the following case.Statutory interpretation \nis when judges decide on the meaning and application of the words or terms in an Act to resolve a dispute before the court.\n  Legal brief 9.2 \nSearching for meaning\nIn March 2014 police investigating the alleged fraud and \nsale of works by Australian artist Brett Whiteley applied for two search warrants. The search warrants were issued under the Crimes Act 1956 (Vic) s 465(1). The warrants allowed the police to break, enter and search for:\nAny paint, frames, solvents, sketches, notebooks \nor any other item used in the manufacturing of the fraudulent WHITELEY paintings. Evidence of /f_i  nancial transactions, photographs and/or digital images relating to fraudulent WHITELEY paintings.\nThe place named in the /f_i  rst warrant was the private \nhome of suspect Mohamed Siddique. The second was his business premises.\nA total of 36 items were seized in Siddique\u2019s home and \n23 items were seized from his business premises. Some of the items seized were named or described in the warrant. Others were not, including paintings attributed to Australian artists Charles Blackman and Howard Arkley.\nThe police documents listing the items seized did not \ndistinguish between items named or described in the warrant and other items. The police also requested that some items be analysed or examined and retained as evidence. The police lodged the relevant documentation with the Magistrates\u2019 Court.\nOn 16 May 2014 Siddique /f_i  led an application with \nthe Magistrates\u2019 Court, in accordance with s 78(6) of the Magistrates\u2019 Court Act 1989 (Vic) for the return of all items seized.\nSection 78(6) says:\nThe Court may direct that any article, thing or \nmaterial seized under a search warrant be returned to its owner, subject to any condition that the court thinks /f_i  t \u2026\nSome goods were returned; others were not.\nOn 27 August 2014 Siddique\u2019s application under \ns 78(6) for the outstanding goods came before the \nMagistrates\u2019 Court. The court decided that it did not have jurisdiction to order the return of the items not speci/f_i  ed on the warrants. The magistrate accepted the submission that the property had been seized under common law and not under s 78(6) of the Magistrates\u2019 \nCourt Act. The magistrate concluded that Siddique needed to commence a separate civil proceeding against the police.\nOn 20 June 2014 Siddique /f_i  led a writ in the Victorian \nSupreme Court Trial Division, claiming damages for trespass on grounds including that some of the goods seized were seized unlawfully because they were not goods described in the warrants. He also lodged an application to appeal to the Trial Division of the Supreme Court challenging the magistrate\u2019s interpretation.\nThe issue for deliberation by Justice Bell of the \nSupreme Court was whether the paintings were \u2018seized under a search warrant\u2019 within the meaning of s 78(6). The question of whether the paintings were \u2018unlawfully seized\u2019 was to be decided by the trial judge in a separate civil case.\nJustice Bell decided that an:\ninterpretation of the word \u2018under\u2019 in s 78(6) that \nrequires the relevantly seized item to be joined up with the authority to seize in the subject warrant is supported by the context of s 78 as a whole \u2026\ns 78(6) is a provision that, properly interpreted, \nconfers discretion upon the court to order the return of seized property as speci/f_i  ed in the warrant concerned. It is not a provision that confers discretion to order the return of other items seized, whether lawfully or unlawfully, during the execution of the warrant. That may be a pity because it forces individuals to seek separate recovery of property seized during the execution of, but not under, a warrant when, in most cases, the discretionary procedure in s 78(6) might conveniently cover both situations.

  "Page 322": "Siddique sought leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. \nThe question was whether s  78(6) covers items seized \n\u2018under a search warrant\u2019 but not named or described in \nthe search warrant. Justice Bell also noted that:\nThe matter depends principally on the proper \nconstruct of s 78(6). That in turn requires that attention be focused on the statutory text, context and purpose.\nInterpreting the search warrant case\nWhen interpreting the words or terms used in an Act \nthe court will consider the purpose of the provisions. In deciding this question the court considered the purpose of s 78(6) to be to facilitate the recovery of a person\u2019s property when it has been taken by the state against their will or without their consent.\nCourts can refer to a range of intrinsic and extrinsic \nsources to assist in the interpretation of legislation. They may also refer to precedent.\nReferring to extrinsic material\nThe word \u2018under\u2019 requires context. The court considered the de/f_i  nition of \u2018under\u2019 according to various dictionaries, where it was de/f_i  ned as \u2018in accordance with\u2019, \u2018pursuant to\u2019, and \u2018by virtue of\u2019, and concluded that the use of \u2018under\u2019 in a statutory provision:\nsets up a convenient, summary method for citizens \nto obtain the return of their own property after it has been taken from them against their will\nand so protects individuals from intrusion by the state.\nReferring to precedent\nThe court referred to a number of past cases. These \ncases considered the rights of individuals in relation to the execution of search warrants. They considered both common law and statutory protections. The court referred to a number of past decisions. Referring to the case of Southam v Smout [1964] 1 QB 308, at 320:\nLord Denning MR said, adopting a quotation from \nthe Earl of Chatham:\nThe poorest man may in his cottage bid de/f_i  ance \nto all the forces of the Crown. It may be frail \u2013 its roof may shake \u2013 the wind may blow through it \u2013 the storm may enter \u2013 the rain may enter \u2013 but the King of England cannot enter \u2013 all his force dares not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement. So be it \u2013 unless he has justi/f_i  cation by law \u2026\nIn Trans Nominees Pty Ltd v Scheffler (1986) 42 SASR \n361, at 369, it was noted that:\nthe court will construe such statutes strictly, resolving any ambiguity in favour of the subject, and insist upon strict compliance with the statute and the conditions by which the warrant is authorised.\nThe court indicated that there was not:\nany reason why parliament would have intended to distinguish between seized items that have been named and described in the relevant warrant and other items seized in the course of executing the self-same warrant.\u2018Under a warrant\u2019\nThe court found that the items were seized \u2018under the \nwarrant\u2019. The court referred to the case of Ghani v Jones [1970] 1 QB 693, at 706, in which Lord Denning stated, in relation to the execution of a search warrant by police/uni00A0of/f_i  cers:\nIf in the course of their search they come upon \nother goods which show him to be implicated in some other crime, they may take them provided they act reasonably and detain them no longer than is necessary.\nThe court concluded that:\nnone of the items was seized under purely common law powers and all of them were seized \u2018under\u2019 a search warrant within the meaning and for the purpose of s 78(6).\nand, later, that:\nwithout a warrant the police of/f_i  cers would be trespassing on private property and invading the occupier of the house. In those circumstances the of/f_i  cers would need to reply upon purely common law powers, if available, to justify seizure of property.\nThe court stated that a strict interpretation of the \nprovision:\nmay be mandated with respect to the authorisation \nof State interference with private property, [and] a broad construction is to be preferred with respect to a statutory provision that alleviates that interference. Nor does there seem to be any reason why parliament would have intended to distinguish between seized items that had been named and described in the relevant warrant and other items seized in the course of the execution of the self-same warrant.\nDecision\nThe Court of Appeal decided that goods not named \nor described in the warrant but lawfully seized in the execution of the warrant should be treated as goods \u2018seized under the search warrant\u2019 for the purposes of s\n 78(6). Therefore, the Magistrates\u2019 Court could order \nthe return of the items seized by the police. In reaching this decision the court stressed the importance of the purpose/uni00A0of s\n 78(6) as a means for individuals to obtain \nthe return of their property and a protection to lessen the/uni00A0 effect of interference with private property by the/uni00A0state.\nThe Court of Appeal quashed the decision of the \nmagistrate to dismiss the application for the return of the property. The Court of Appeal did not decide if Siddique\u2019s property should be returned to him. The case was returned to the Magistrates\u2019 Court to be reheard and redetermined.\nIn May 2016 a Supreme Court of Victoria jury found \nSiddique guilty on two counts of obtaining /f_i  nancial advantage by deception and one count of attempting to do so.

How were some of these approaches used in the case of Siddique v Martin?\n3 To what extent do you think that the Court of Appeal in the Siddique v Martin case created law? Explain.\n9.7   Reasons for interpreting \nstatutes\nThere are several reasons why it is necessary for the courts to interpret a statute. One of \nthe problems in drafting legislation is that legislation attempts to cover every situation that \nhas happened (or that might arise). But Acts of Parliament often set out the law dealing with a specifi  c area only in broad terms. The courts will need to interpret whether the broad terms set out in the Act include the specifi  c circumstances in the case before them.\nTable 9.2 Why legislation may need to be interpreted\nThe intention of the \nAct is not clear \u00b7Parliament\u2019s intention may not be clear enough. Accurate instructions and \ndirection may not have been given to the Parliamentary Counsel.\nThe Act is about a \ncomplex and technical topic \u00b7Parliamentary Counsel may not be familiar with specialist areas, such as \nareas of technology.\nDif/f_i  culty in foreseeing \npossible future applications of the Act \u00b7It is dif/f_i  cult to consider all future applications of an Act. In our rapidly \nevolving society it is almost impossible to predict changes in technology and science, or social and environmental conditions.\nInconsistencies within \nan Act or between Acts \u00b7Lengthy Acts, or Acts that have been amended a number of times, may \ncause problems in that there may be inconsistencies. Various provisions within an Act may vary slightly, as the same word may be used in more than one context within the Act, resulting in confusion.\nTime pressures in \ndrafting legislation \u00b7There may have been pressure to draft the Act in a hurry, resulting in \nclumsy, vague or ambiguous wording within the Act.\n \u00b7Due to time pressures in drafting legislation, there may not have been suf/f_i  cient communication between the instructing minister and the Parliamentary Counsel.\n \u00b7There may have been little opportunity to check the legislation after drafting. This may result in loopholes.\nProblems relating to \nde/f_i  ning words \u00b7The words used in an Act may attempt to cover a broad range of \nsituations, but the courts have to interpret whether a speci/f_i  c situation comes under this broad de/f_i  nition.\n \u00b7Words may not be de/f_i  ned within the Act.\n \u00b7Often Acts need to be interpreted to limit con/f_l  ict between Acts within a/uni00A0State or between a State and the Commonwealth.\n \u00b7Language is by its nature imprecise \u2013 words may change meaning over/uni00A0time.\nWords used may not \ncover recent changes \u00b7Legislation may have become outdated and need to be revised. The \nwording of an Act may not cover recent changes. For instance, a statute may refer to records and tape recordings but not speci/f_i  cally refer to other forms of recording technology, such as DVDs or the downloading of/uni00A0music from the internet.An Act may need to be \ninterpreted because it was written in broad terms or there were problems interpreting the Act.\nAn Act may need to be interpreted because there are problems relating to de/f_i  ning terms, or the meaning of terms has changed over time. When interpreting an Act judges must interpret the intention of parliament.

  "Page 324": "9.8   How judges interpret \nlegislation\nWhen interpreting the words or phrases in Acts of Parliament, courts consider what \nparliament had in mind when making the legislation in question \u2013 that is, what parliament\u2019s intent or purpose was.\nThere are a number of sources or aids used by judges to help them arrive at the \nintention of the legislation. These sources may be either intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic sources are those that are contained within the Act. Extrinsic sources are sources that are\u00a0not contained in the Act.\nIntrinsic sources\nJudges will refer to other sections of the Act to interpret the meaning of terms or words in an Act. For instance, judges will refer to the words in the Act, the margin notes, the footnotes, the long title and the object or purpose clauses. Most Acts contain a section where words used commonly throughout the Act are defi  ned. For example, the Transport Accident Act 1986 (Vic) defi  nes a \u2018transport accident\u2019 as \u2018an incident directly caused by , or arising out of, the driving of a motor car, railway train or tram\u2019. Some Acts also have schedules that may help. Schedules appear after the main sections in the text of the Act. They are often used to spell out in more detail how the provisions of the Act are to work in practice. The Road Safety Act 1986 (Vic), for instance, contains a schedule that links a \ndriver\u2019s blood alcohol content to the maximum period of licence cancellation.\nExtrinsic sources\nJudges may also refer to sources outside the Act to guide them in the task of interpretation. These include dictionaries, legislative guidelines, second reading speeches and previous decisions.\nDictionaries\nCourts may refer to authoritative legal dictionaries, such as Jowitt\u2019s Dictionary of English Law, or to standard English dictionaries, such as the Oxford English Dictionary.\nLegislative guidelines\nThere is legislation passed by both the Commonwealth and State parliaments specifi  cally\u00a0to guide courts. It sets out what other sources judges can use when interpreting legislation.Judges can refer to \nintrinsic sources. These include looking at sections within an Act to determine its meaning: margin notes, footnotes, the de/f_i  nition sections and the object or/uni00A0purpose/uni00A0clause.\nJudges can refer to extrinsic sources. These include dictionaries, second reading speeches, legislative guidelines and previous decisions.\nTable 9.3 Legislation provides guides for interpretation\nActs Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) Interpretation of Legislation Act 1984 (Vic)\n \u00b7Commonwealth Acts must be read or interpreted in accordance \nwith the purpose or spirit of the legislation.\n \u00b7Since 1981, all Acts of the Commonwealth parliament contain object clauses. These clauses are sections within the body of the/uni00A0Act setting out the general aims of the legislation.\n \u00b7Courts are permitted to refer to any reports prepared before the provisions were enacted. This includes reports by a Law Reform Commission, and treaties and international agreements referred to in the parliamentary process.\n \u00b7Courts are required to consider explanatory materials when interpreting legislation. \u00b7Courts are required to interpret legislation according to the purpose and intention of the statute.\n \u00b7Courts may refer to the following materials in interpreting legislation: parliamentary debates; reports of parliamentary committees, royal commissions, law reform commissioners and commissions, boards of inquiry and other similar material.\n \u00b7The Act allows courts to refer to headings, schedules, marginal notes, footnotes, and other parts, divisions or subdivisions within the Act.\n \u00b7Commonly used terms that regularly appear in most Acts of Parliament or are explained or de/f_i  ned within the Interpretation of/uni00A0Legislation Act.\nSecond reading speeches\nThe second reading speech is where the relevant minister explains the reasons for \nputting\u00a0the proposed law to parliament. This helps make clear what the intent of the proposed legislation is. All parliamentary proceedings are recorded in Hansard. 316  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 325": "Previous decisions\nIt is possible that words requiring interpretation have already been interpreted by a court \nin an earlier case. The court may look at that earlier decision to interpret the legislation. Where the interpretation was made in a higher court, and the case involves the same Act, then the previous decision is a binding precedent.\nCommon law principles of interpretation\nBefore the passing of the Commonwealth and State legislation described above, judges used traditional common law principles as a guide when interpreting statutes. These traditional approaches were referred to as rules or legal maxims. Although these rules have been largely replaced by the guidelines set out by parliament, it is still important to understand some of the maxims referred to by judges.\nThe maxim of ejusdem generis is particularly important. This term literally means \u2018of the \nsame kind\u2019. This rule of interpretation applies when judges are faced with interpreting the meaning of a section of an Act in which a number of specifi  c terms are followed by a general term. This may sound a little confusing. Consider the following hypothetical example.\nParliament passes a law that requires a fl  agpole to be installed on every \u2018house, fl  at, \nbungalow or other dwelling\u2019. Mr W owns a caravan that is his permanent home. He refuses to install a fl  agpole. In deciding whether Mr W has committed an offence the court would need to consider whether a caravan is a \u2018dwelling\u2019, as referred to in the Act.\nAccording to the ejusdem generis maxim, where specifi  c words have been used to form \na class, the general words immediately following that class should be given a meaning confi  ned to that class. In this instance, the specifi  c words are \u2018house, bungalow , fl  at\u2019. The meaning of the term \u2018other dwelling\u2019 should be confi  ned to dwellings used for the same purpose. A house, bungalow and fl  at are residential dwellings. Therefore, the term \u2018other dwelling\u2019 could be seen as applying to buildings used for residential purposes. Mr W\u2019s caravan is used for residential purposes. It could therefore be argued that his caravan is an\u00a0\u2018other dwelling\u2019 for the purposes of this Act.\nTable 9.4 Other maxims\nexpressio unius est \nexclusio/uni00A0alteriusThe express mention of one term is to the exclusion of others.\nut res magis valeat quam pereat It is preferable to preserve a piece of legislation than to destroy it.\nnoscitur a sociis A word is known by \u2018the company it keeps\u2019 \u2013 or, as some legal texts say, \u2018words of a feather /f_l  ock \ntogether\u2019! The meaning of a word is limited by the words immediately preceding it.\nlex non cogit ad impossibilia The law does not expect a person to do that which is impossible (not merely dif/f_i  cult or inconvenient).\n9.9   What effect does statutory \ninterpretation have?\nStatutory interpretation does not amend or change the printed words of an Act. The \nimmediate effect of statutory interpretation is that the meaning of the words in the Act is determined in order to settle a dispute.\nHowever, statutory interpretation can also have a number of other effects. Among \nother\u00a0things, statutory interpretation can do the following.\n\u2022 Form a precedent: If the decision has been made by a higher court, the reason for\u00a0that decision will form a binding precedent to be followed by lower courts in the\u00a0same court hierarchy in similar cases.\n\u2022 Limit the scope of the legislation: If the court gives a narrow or limited interpretation to words or terms, the interpretation may limit the range of circumstances that the Act may apply to.\n\u2022 Increase the scope of the legislation: If the court gives a broad interpretation to words or terms, the interpretation may extend the range of circumstances that the Act may apply to.Statutory interpretation \ngives meaning to terms but does not alter the written words in an Act.\nStatutory interpretation can form a precedent for future cases.\nStatutory interpretation can either broaden or limit the scope of an Act.

He referred to the case of Wilson v Kuhl; Ryan v Kuhl [1979] VR 315, in which the meaning of the term \u2018offensive weapon\u2019 was considered. In that case the judge said that:\nAny physical article is an offensive weapon if it is \nan article of a kind normally used only to in/f_l  ict or threaten injury. A knuckleduster is an article of this kind.

What constituted a \u2018weapon\u2019 was not de/f_i  ned in the Act, although objects that may be/uni00A0 considered to be weapons were listed in the Regulations.\nUsing dictionaries\nAs the word \u2018weapon\u2019 was not de/f_i  ned in the Act, the judge had to use other references to determine the meaning: the Oxford English Dictionary and the legal encyclopaedia Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England. In Deing v \nTarola [1993] 2 VR 163, Justice Beach stated:\nThe Oxford English Dictionary de/f_i  nes \u2018weapon\u2019 \nas \u2018An instrument of any kind used in warfare or in combat to attack and overcome an enemy\u2019.\nThat would seem to me to be a particularly \nwide/uni00A0de/f_i  nition; not one which gives great assistance when construing the provisions of the/uni00A0Act and regulations made under it. Given a literal interpretation it could encompass such things/uni00A0as pieces of timber, lengths of piping, brickbats and the like. Indeed, in one view of the matter, it could include almost any physical object.\nIt would seem to me that a more appropriate \ninterpretation of the word \u2018weapon\u2019 is that \nappearing in Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England \n(3rd/uni00A0edition, Volume 10 at page 653). Then, when dealing with the phrase \u2018offensive weapon\u2019, the learned author says: \u2018Large clubs or sticks are offensive weapons. The expression includes anything that is not in common use for any other purpose but that of a weapon. But a common whip is not such a weapon; nor probably is a hatchet which is caught up accidentally during the heat of an affray.\u2019 318  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law Chapter 9 The role of the courts in law-making 319\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

What constituted a \u2018weapon\u2019 was not de/f_i  ned in the Act, although objects that may be/uni00A0 considered to be weapons were listed in the Regulations.\nUsing dictionaries\nAs the word \u2018weapon\u2019 was not de/f_i  ned in the Act, the judge had to use other references to determine the meaning: the Oxford English Dictionary and the legal encyclopaedia Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England. In Deing v \nTarola [1993] 2 VR 163, Justice Beach stated:\nThe Oxford English Dictionary de/f_i  nes \u2018weapon\u2019 \nas \u2018An instrument of any kind used in warfare or in combat to attack and overcome an enemy\u2019.\nThat would seem to me to be a particularly \nwide/uni00A0de/f_i  nition; not one which gives great assistance when construing the provisions of the/uni00A0Act and regulations made under it. Given a literal interpretation it could encompass such things/uni00A0as pieces of timber, lengths of piping, brickbats and the like. Indeed, in one view of the matter, it could include almost any physical object.\nIt would seem to me that a more appropriate \ninterpretation of the word \u2018weapon\u2019 is that \nappearing in Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England \n(3rd/uni00A0edition, Volume 10 at page 653). Then, when dealing with the phrase \u2018offensive weapon\u2019, the learned author says: \u2018Large clubs or sticks are offensive weapons. The expression includes anything that is not in common use for any other purpose but that of a weapon. But a common whip is not such a weapon; nor probably is a hatchet which is caught up accidentally during the heat of an affray.\u2019 318  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law Chapter 9 The role of the courts in law-making 319\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 328": "9.10   The ability of judges and \ncourts to make law\nSometimes a case comes before the courts concerning a matter on which there has \nbeen no clear statement of law , or where the existing principles of law are out of date and require change. In these circumstances, having the matter resolved by the courts may result in a change in the law . Recent examples of such issues include disputes about the rights of the unborn child, surrogacy , access to reproductive technologies and the recognition of Native Title.\nHowever, not all cases which come before the courts result in \u2018law-making\u2019 by courts. \nThe factors that affect the ability of the courts to make law can be said to relate to: the limitations of the doctrine of precedent, the willingness of judges to change existing law , the costs and time involved in bringing a case to court, and the requirement for \u2018standing\u2019.\nThe doctrine of precedent\nThe courts are not free to make law in the same sense as parliament is. Unlike parliament, judges cannot make law as an immediate response to a community demand or when a general need is perceived. The courts can act only to declare the legal principles that apply to the facts of the cases before them. In the majority of cases, judges have no discretion to make law .\n\u2018Novel\u2019 cases\nBefore a court can declare a new legal principle, it must wait for a \u2018novel\u2019 case: a case concerned with a particular issue or legal question that has not been decided before in a court of superior record in the same hierarchy . A novel case is one in which the fact situation can be distinguished from the facts in previously decided cases (that is, the facts are different), and in which, therefore, no precedent applies. An example of a novel case is\u00a0Donoghue v Stevenson (above). A novel case is also called a test case.\nTEST  CASES\nTest cases are not common. First, the parties must have suffi  cient fi  nancial \nbacking to bear the costs involved in taking a court action. As such a case is res integra (a case of fi  rst impression) there are no guarantees that their claim will be successful. If the party bringing the case to court is unsuccessful, they risk having to meet not only their own legal costs, but also the costs of the other party .\nHigher courts\nThe operation of the doctrine of precedent may mean that lower courts are not in a \nposition to develop a new legal principle. The operation of stare decisis means that, in \neffect, only higher courts can make or change a binding precedent. For a change to occur, the case presented before the higher court must concern a new fact situation to which no existing binding precedent applies. Even so, the court can only reach a decision in relation to the information presented in that individual case. It cannot change entire areas of law in the same way that parliament can.\nJudicial conservatism or activism\nFor a court to change the law , a case must come before a court in which the judges are prepared to adopt a law-making role. A conservative judge may declare that the plaintiff has no cause of action under common law and dismiss the case. But another judge may decide that there is nothing to prevent the court from deciding the case. Such a judge may be aware of the need to develop the law \u2013 this is sometimes referred to as judicial\u00a0activism.Courts can set a new \nprecedent when they hear a case on which there is no clear statement of law.\nCourts need a \u2018novel\u2019 or test case before a new precedent can be made.\nFor a new legal principle to develop, the case must/uni00A0be heard by a higher/uni00A0court.\nThe judge must be prepared to adopt a/uni00A0law-making role. 320  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 329": "WHAT IS JUDICIAL ACTIVISM ?\nChief Justice RS French, in \u2018Judicial Activism \u2013 \nThe\u00a0boundaries of the judicial role\u2019, writes:\nAustralian constitutional law academic, Professor \nCraven, has offered three defi  nitions which are really one, relating respectively to the common law , the statute law and to the Constitution. Judicial activism in his view involves the conscious development of the common law according to the perceptions of the court as to the direction the law should take in terms of legal, social or other policy . It exists in relation to statute law where a court consciously adopts an interpretation of statutory language which goes well beyond the ordinary import of the words because the court believes that an extended interpretation is necessary to give effect to the true legislative intention or because it wishes to frustrate an unpalatable legislative intention. In connection with constitutional interpretation he appears to equate activism with \u2018progressivism\u2019. This he describes as an approach to constitutional interpretation which requires continual updating of the Constitution in line with the perceived community and social expectations rather than according to its tenor or [in] conformity with the intentions of those who wrote it.\nOver the years, the role of judges as law-makers has been debated at length. The degree \nto which judges are prepared to distinguish one case from previous cases will depend in part on the judges\u2019 view of their role in the law-making process, and some judges are reluctant to be seen as law-makers. In order for the courts to be properly involved in the law-making process, they must assert their power to bring about a change in the law .\nThe case of Donoghue v Stevenson ultimately resulted in judges looking beyond the \ncontractual relationship between parties and considering the scope of the duty of care owed by one party to another. This case is a good example of judicial activism (but in the Australian context, it did rely on the judges in the Grant v Australian Knitting Mills case being prepared to follow the House of Lords\u2019 departure from the \u2018norm\u2019).\nCourts can also be very conservative. In 1985, the Victorian County Court, hearing a \nmarital rape case, applied an English precedent from the 1700s. This precedent stated that a \u2018husband cannot be guilty of rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife, for by their mutual matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband, which she cannot retract\u2019.\nIt took less than a month for parliament to step in and amended the Crimes Act to \nremove the marital exemption to rape.\nThe case of State Government Insurance Commission v Trigwell 1979 CLR 617 is \nanother example of judicial conservatism. In this case a 1947 English precedent that farmers did not owe a duty of care to road users if their stock strayed onto roads was upheld (see Legal brief 9.4, below).

  "Page 331": "A decision by a court about what the law should be is not always reached quickly . \nCourts cannot reach a decision before they hear all the arguments put by both parties. \nIn\u00a0complex cases, this can take a considerable amount of time. A fi  nal determination as to what the law should be, may not be reached until after a case has been heard on appeal. This may take years \u2013 which means the law can be slow to change.\nStanding\n\u2018Standing\u2019 (locus standi) is the right of a party to start a legal action in a court. A party will have standing if they have what is considered suffi  cient connection to, and interest in, the court action. To put it another way , a person has \u2018standing\u2019 if they are directly affected by an action which would continue unless relief is granted by an order of damages. That is, if\u00a0the person does not stand to lose something, they do not have \u2018standing\u2019.\nDEMONSTRATING A \nSPECIAL\u00a0INTEREST\nGenerally , a person\u2019s standing is clear and not in dispute. The common law test \nfor standing is that the person has either a private right that is affected (such as a property right) or can demonstrate that they have a \u2018special interest\u2019 in the matter. When the standing of a party is disputed, the parties need to demonstrate that they have a special interest. The most common examples of a party claiming a special interest are:\n \u00b7a public interest group challenging a policy of a government which is a concern for the group\n \u00b7a trade union or association challenging a government decision that affects their members\n \u00b7a commercial entity challenging a government decision that they claim is to the benefi  t of a competitor\n \u00b7a person challenging a government decision that is a concern to them even though it does not affect their rights.\n\u2018Standing\u2019 is crucial in both common law and statute in Australia. The relevant statute law is \nthe Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth), and the common law relating to standing is found in decisions of the High Court of Australia. When a party\u2019s standing is denied, the party may appeal, but this will happen only if the party is again prepared to risk the costs of such an action. As already mentioned, for any change to occur, the case may need to come before a judge who is willing to adopt a new direction in precedent.\nThe leading case in this area is Australian Conservation Foundation v Commonwealth \n1980 HCA 53. In this case the Australian Conservation Foundation objected to the approval of a proposal for a company to establish and operate a resort and tourist area at Farnborough, in Central Queensland. The case went all the way to the High Court, and the fi  rst issue for them was whether the Foundation had locus standi.\nGibbs J, in his judgment, indicated that the common law test for standing is whether \nthe\u00a0plaintiff has a \u2018special interest in the subject matter of the action\u2019. He later concluded:\nI would not deny that a person might have a special interest in the preservation \nof a particular environment. However, an interest, for present purposes, does not mean a mere intellectual or emotional concern. A person is not interested within the meaning of the rule, unless he is likely to gain some advantage, other than the satisfaction of righting a wrong, upholding a principle or winning a contest, if his action succeeds or to suffer some disadvantage, other than a sense of grievance or a debt for costs, if his action fails. A belief, however strongly felt, that the law generally , or a particular law , should be observed, or that conduct of a particular kind should be prevented, does not suffi  ce to give its possessor locus standi. If that were not so, the rule requiring special interest would be meaningless. Any plaintiff who felt strongly enough to bring an action could maintain it. It is quite clear that when the rule is thus understood, the Foundation has no special interest in the preservation of the environment at Farnborough \u2026For more information \nabout civil procedures see/uni00A0Chapter 5.

  "Page 332": "  Legal brief 9.4 \nAre farmers responsible for animals that stray?\nAustralian law about the liability of farmers for animals straying onto highways was based \non a long-standing British precedent. This precedent dated back to the times when farms did not have fences, before the invention of cars or the development of major roads and highways. The legal principle was that owners of land adjoining a road were under no legal obligation to fence in animals to avoid their straying onto the road. Farmers did not \u2018owe a duty of care\u2019 to road users. This rule was upheld in the English case of Searle/uni00A0v/uni00A0Wallbank [1947] 1 All ER 12.\nThis law applied to all Australian States that had not passed legislation on the rights of \nfarmers and road users. The application of the legal principles of Searle v/uni00A0Wallbank was challenged in State Government Insurance Commission v Trigwell (1979) 142 CLR/uni00A0617.\nTrigwell\u2019s case\nIn this case, a woman was travelling at night along a road in rural South Australia. When she saw a car approaching from the opposite direction she dipped her car headlights. However, as her headlights were on low, she did not see two sheep that had strayed onto the road from a nearby farm. In the collision with the sheep, the car swerved across the road and collided with the oncoming car, in which the Trigwell family was travelling. The woman driving the car was killed and members of the Trigwell family were seriously/uni00A0injured.\nThe Trigwells sued for the damages caused by the accident. They claimed that the \naccident was caused by the negligence of:\n\u00b7the farmer in failing to ensure that his sheep did not escape through broken fences,\nand\n\u00b7the driver of the other car.\nThe State Government Insurance Commission was the deceased driver\u2019s insurance company. They would be responsible for paying for any damages caused by the negligent actions of the driver. The Supreme Court of South Australia decided that the State Government Insurance Commission had to pay the Trigwells for the damages resulting from the negligent actions of the driver.\nEvidence was presented to the court that indicated that the driver had not tried to slow \ndown after hitting the sheep. This evidence was suf/f_i  cient to convince the judges that there had been a failure on the part of the driver to exercise reasonable care. However, the court decided that the farmer, who had not repaired his fences and had thereby failed to stop the sheep from straying onto the road, was not liable, under the legal principles established in Searle v Wallbank.\nThe State Government Insurance Commission appealed to the High Court against the \ndecision of the Supreme Court of South Australia.\nThe High Court decision\nThe High Court decided that the legal principles developed in Searle v Wallbank applied in Australia, and their decision in this case was a binding precedent on all State courts. Unless a State had legislated to override the common law relating to stray animals, the courts were bound to apply this precedent. To overcome this problem, the Victorian parliament later passed the Wrongs (Animals Straying on Highways) Act 1984 (Vic). Similarly, the South Australian parliament legislated in 1983 to limit the application of the precedent in that State.\nAre courts law-makers?\nThe statements made by the judges in Trigwell\u2019s case reveal the attitudes that some judges have to the role of the courts in changing the law.\nThe court is not a legislator\nJustice Mason (who represented the majority view) stated:\nI do not doubt that there are some cases in which an ultimate court of appeal can \nand should vary or modify what has been thought to be a settled rule or principle of common law on the ground that it is ill-adapted to modern circumstances.

  "Page 334": "9.11   The relationship between \ncourts and parliament\nIn contemporary Australian society , there is a complex range of laws. These laws are \nnecessary to protect the rights of individuals and to achieve social cohesion. The dynamic relationship between parliament and the courts in law-making is crucial to maintaining the effectiveness of these laws.\nSupremacy of parliament\nAs stated earlier, parliament is the supreme law-making authority , answerable to the people. It should be remembered that courts only exist because they were created by Acts of Parliament. For example, the High Court of Australia is provided for by the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (UK), and the Victorian Supreme Court, founded in 1852, derives its authority from the Victorian Constitution. A court\u2019s authority , including its jurisdictional limit, has been set by parliament. Since parliament can make or unmake any of its own laws (subject also to the relevant Constitution) it follows that, other than the High Court, a parliament can both limit the authority of a court and abolish it.\nParliament can pass a law to override the common law made by the courts. The \ncourts can declare a law made by parliament ultra vires when it exceeds the law-making authority set out in the Constitution.\nThe codifi  cation of common law\nParliament may decide to bring common law principles within statute law . This process is known as \u2018codifi  cation\u2019. This means that the common law is restated in Acts and becomes statute law .\nThe abrogation of common law\nParliament may also abolish common law principles it disagrees with. This is referred to as \u2018abrogation\u2019.\nJustice Gibbs, in The Australian Conservation Foundation v Commonwealth [1980] HCA \n53, clearly stated that it is the responsibility of parliament, not the courts, to abrogate:\nIn any case, if the law is settled, it is our duty to apply it, not to abrogate it. It is for \nthe Parliament, whose members are the elected representatives of the people, to change an established rule if they consider it to be undesirable, and not for judges, unelected and unrepresentative, to determine not what is, but what ought to be, the\u00a0law .\nParliament\u2019s ability to codify and abrogate common law is an important aspect of the \nrelationship between courts and parliaments as law-makers. The Mabo case and the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (see \u2018Eddie Mabo\u2019s epic fi  ght for land rights changed Australian law and history\u2019, on p.329) is an example of codifi  cation, and the Victorian parliament\u2019s response to Trigwell\u2019s case and the Widow\u2019s discount case are examples of\u00a0abrogation.\nANIMALS STRAYING ON \nHIGHWAYS \u2013 ABROGATION IN\u00a0ACTION\nAfter Trigwell\u2019s case (above) held that farmers were not responsible for the \ndamage done by their animals that strayed onto roads, the Victorian parliament \nacted to abrogate (that is, legislatively abolish) this decision. It passed the Wrongs (Animals Straying on Highways) Act 1984, which altered the law so that farmers were responsible for the actions of their animals on the roads.Parliament can pass \nlaws to either abrogate (override) or codify (restate) common law.If parliament passes a law/uni00A0outside its constitutional power, the/uni00A0courts may declare it/uni00A0ultra vires: outside that/uni00A0body\u2019s law-making power. 326  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

This Act gave widows access to compensation for economic or material disadvantage caused by the death of their spouse. In 2000, the WA District Court reduced the original compensation awarded to her by 5%. In an appeal to the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia, this reduction was increased to 20%. The Full Court cited \u2018remarriage contingency\u2019, known as the widow\u2019s discount, as the basis for the reduction.\nThe Full Court decision was based on a precedent \nset by an 1863 ruling in England and Australian legal precedents in the 1930s. England changed its law in 1971 to make remarriage prospects irrelevant in calculating compensation, but the precedent remained in Australia. Early last century , most women were fi  nancially dependent on their husbands and widows were expected to remarry to survive economically . Today , most people would see these assumptions as sexist and not consistent with our community values.\nAn appeal to the High Court in November 2002 \nreversed this decision, but there was still concern that the widow\u2019s discount could apply to other women in future cases. The Victorian parliament responded in 2004 by passing the Wrongs (Remarriage Discount) Act to clarify the law in Victoria.\nTeresa de Sales outside the High Court\n Chapter 9 The role of the courts in law-making 327\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 336": "9.12   The ability of courts to \ninfl  uence parliament\nThe courts are responsible for determining the day-to-day application of the law . \nCourts will do this in two ways. First, if a case comes before the court, the court will \nlook at statute\u00a0law to determine what the law is. In order to do this, the court will need to interpret or give meaning to the words used in Acts. Through interpretation of words in statutes challenged in court cases, courts are able to ascertain what parliament meant when passing that legislation, and then apply either a literal (narrow) or liberal (wide) interpretation. A\u00a0court\u2019s reason for deciding the meaning of words or phrases in an Act also forms a ratio/uni00A0decidendi.\nThe decision of a court about the interpretations that should be applied to words or \nphrases in an Act therefore becomes a precedent, which will be used for later cases. Then\u00a0the legislation and the precedent must be read together. In many instances, the court\u2019s interpretation may result in the need for amendment to the Act in question.\nAt times, the interpretation given to legislation may not be that foreseen by the \nparliament, or at least the government, when the legislation was introduced. However, parliament is the ultimate law-making body . If parliament does not agree with a court\u2019s interpretation of a statute, it can amend the statute to overrule the court\u2019s interpretation.\nSecond, judges make \nlaw when deciding on a case for which there is no existing statute or common law . At these times, courts break new ground. The reason for the court\u2019s decision, the ratio decidendi, is then binding on lower courts in future cases. In some circumstances, parliament may have failed to legislate on an issue because of the issue\u2019s complexity or because it is controversial. Since courts are independent of the political process, they may be able to make laws that parliament fi  nds diffi  cult. Courts thus have an important role of \u2018fi  lling the gaps\u2019 left by parliament. Parliament may later decide to legislate to fi  ll the gaps.

Told the government to \nshove it.\u2019 Darryl Kerrigan, in The Castle.\nEddie Koiki Mabo was born on Murray Island, in the Torres \nStrait, on June 29, 1936.\nA member of the Meriam people, who know the island \nas Mer, Mabo was adopted and raised by his uncle, from whom he took his name, after his mother\u2019s death.\nHe was expelled from the island for breaking customary \nlaws when he was 16, and travelled around northern Queensland working various jobs.\nHe eventually settled in Townsville, where he married \nBonita Nehow at age 23.\nBonita was a traditional owner of nearby Palm Island, \nand together they would have ten children.\nSpeaking in 1993, she said her husband started to \nquestion his rights in 1969, when he tried to return to Murray Island to visit his dying father, only to be refused entry by authorities who feared he was a troublemaker.\n\u2018That\u2019s when he started talking about \u201chis land\u201d\u2019 ,\u2019 she said.Mabo started work as a gardener at James Cook \nUniversity when he was 31, and it was here a chance conversation would shake his understanding of his people\u2019s land to the core.\nHaving lunch in 1974 with historian Henry Reynolds \nand academic Noel Loos, Mabo was shocked when they explained that his people\u2019s traditional ownership of the island was not recognised by Australian law.\nThe courts worked on the principal that Australia \nwas terra nullius \u2013 \u2018land belonging to no one\u2019 \u2013 prior to European settlement.\nThe State of Queensland annexed Murray and other \nTorres Strait islands in 1879, and according to terra nullius, owned that land.\nSpeaking to The Australian last year, Professor Reynolds \nremembered Mabo\u2019s reaction.\n\u2018He said, \u201cEverybody knows it\u2019s Mabo land, it\u2019s been \nMabo land for generations \u2013 no one would dream of trying to move in on it\u201d ,\u2019 he said.\nProfessor Reynolds said the revelation \u2018struck the spark\u2019 \nfor Mabo\u2019s legal battle.\nIn 1982, Mabo and four other Torres Strait Islanders \u2013 \nCeluia Mapo Salee, Sam Passi, Father Dave Passi and James Rice \u2013 started legal action against the State of Queensland to establish who owned the island.Queensland\u2019s Bjelke-Petersen Government was so \nconcerned by the case, [that] it passed laws to cement ownership of the Torres Strait Islands.\nThose laws were squashed by the High Court in 1988 \nin/uni00A0what become known as Mabo I \u2013 the /f_i  rst step towards his ultimate victory.\nIn 1990, Justice Martin Moynihan of the Queensland \nSupreme Court handed down /f_i  ndings on a series of disputed facts involved in the case.\nJustice Moynihan was highly critical of Mabo and \nrejected his claim to land on Murray Island.\nHe did conclude, however, that the Meriam people lived \non the island prior to European settlement, in a society where land was divided and owned by individuals and families.\nThose /f_i  ndings were then used in Mabo\u2019s favour when \nthe case went to the High Court.\nOn June 3, 1992, ten years after the epic legal saga \nbegan, the High Court ruled by a six-to-one majority that the Meriam people held native title over Murray Island.\nThe decision ended the legal /f_i  ction of terra nullius, and \nwas the /f_i  rst time Native Title was recognised in Australia.\nThe Prime Minister at the time, Paul Keating, applauded \nthe decision, saying it removed the greatest barrier to reconciliation.\n\u2018By doing away with the bizarre conceit that this continent \nhad no owners prior to the settlement of Europeans, Mabo establishes a fundamental truth and lays the basis for justice,\u2019 Mr Keating said in his historic speech at Sydney\u2019s Redfern Park.\n\u2018There is nothing to fear or to lose in the recognition \nof historical truth, or the extension of social justice, or the deepening of Australian social democracy to include indigenous Australians.\u2019\nIn 1993 the Federal Parliament passed the Native Title \nAct, which established a legal framework for Native Title \nclaims throughout the country.\nBut Mabo was not there to see his victory.

  "Page 338": "NEWSREPORT  9.3\nWhy has the law about abortion been so slow to develop?\nUNTIL 2008, SECTION 65 OF THE CRIMES ACT 1958  /parenleft.capVIC/parenright.cap  \nstated that procuring an \u2018unlawful\u2019 abortion was a serious \ncrime. However, the Victorian parliament did not de/f_i  ne when an abortion was \u2018unlawful\u2019 . It left the determination of this (that is, when an abortion was unlawful, and when it would be legal) to the courts. The/uni00A0courts came to hold that in Victoria, abortion was legal only in certain conditions \u2013 generally, where the health of the mother is/uni00A0\u2018in danger\u2019 . Thus, the real application of the law was set/uni00A0in precedent rather than in statute.\nMenhennitt case\nIn a test case decided in 1969 (R v Davidson [1969] VR 667), \nJustice Menhennitt of the Victorian Supreme Court ruled that an abortion was lawful if the doctor \u2018honestly believed on reasonable grounds that the act done by him was \u2026 necessary to preserve the woman from a serious danger to her life or her physical or mental health\u2019 . Although in theory a higher court could overturn the ruling in this case at any time, it remained unchallenged for over 30 years.\nFollowing the Menhennitt ruling, abortions were \npermitted where a doctor honestly believed that it was necessary to preserve the woman from serious danger to her life, or to her physical or mental health.\nHigh Court appeal\nIn 1996, the High Court faced a potential test case on abortion when an appeal was lodged from a NSW medical negligence case. The case concerned a woman who became pregnant in the 1980s and gave birth to a healthy child. The single mother\u2019s pregnancy was not diagnosed by her clinic until it was too late for her to have an abortion. This, she claimed, deprived her of the right to have an abortion and forced her to have a child.\nThe woman sued for the costs relating to having and \nrearing a child. The NSW Supreme Court dismissed the case, ruling that the woman had no right to claim damages because abortion was illegal in that State. This decision was overturned by the NSW Court of Appeal.\nA subsequent appeal was lodged with the High Court. The \nemergence of a High Court test case on abortion again fuelled community debate about the legal status of abortion.\nThe community debate\nIt has been suggested that it is not appropriate for the courts to decide cases such as this, which involve complex moral issues. The courts are not in a position to assess community attitudes and it is inappropriate for judges to impose their own personal standards on the community as law.\nOthers suggest that it is better that the courts interpret \nlaws on abortion. It would be di\ufb03   cult to legislate to ensure that the law re/f_l  ects the values of all sections of the community and adequately covers all circumstances.\nPossible impacts\nThese di\ufb03   culties are borne out by the events leading up to the High Court appeal. The Australian Catholic Health Care Association was given legal advice that the case could establish a precedent requiring the 57 Catholic hospitals throughout Australia to advise women about termination. This is something that Catholic hospitals are not required to do at the moment \u2013 and a legal condition they may /f_i  nd di\ufb03   cult to ful/f_i  l. The association applied to argue their position as a \u2018friend of the court\u2019 in the case. They argued that the court should not recognise a claim for the loss of an opportunity to terminate a pregnancy because it is not lawful to terminate.\nThe Abortion Providers Federation of Australasia also \napplied for status as a \u2018friend of the court\u2019 . They argued that \u2018if the status quo is to be disturbed it should be done by parliament, not judicial decision\u2019 .\nSo with powerful interest groups involved, a medical \nnegligence case was poised to bring the whole abortion issue to a head in the High Court. The High Court was spared the di\ufb03   cult decision when the parties decided to settle the case out of court. However, for the medical profession the law was still unclear. Abortion remained a criminal o\ufb00  ence except in the circumstances de/f_i  ned by the/uni00A0common law that made it lawful.\nReview and reform\nIn 2007 Victorian MP Candy Broad proposed a private member\u2019s Bill to decriminalise abortion. The private member\u2019s Bill was withdrawn when the Victorian Premier, John Brumby, announced moves to refer the issue of abortion to the Victorian Law Reform Commission for investigation. The Victorian government undertook to act on the advice of the Victorian Law Reform Commission, which eventually reported back recommending its decriminalisation. On 10/uni00A0October 2008 the Victorian parliament passed the Abortion Law Reform Act 2008 (Vic), which gives women the right to an abortion, free from fear of criminal charge, until 24 weeks\u2019 gestation. After that, the Act states that abortions may still be performed, but that two doctors must believe it appropriate on medical grounds. Doctors with conscientious objections may refer women to another doctor who does perform abortions. There was strong pressure both for and against change in the law, with both pro-choice and anti-abortion protesters attempting to in/f_l  uence parliament.\nWhile public protests continue \u2013 for example the annual \n\u2018March for Babies\u2019\u2013 the basic tenet of the 2008 Act remains the law in Victoria. Victoria has the most liberal abortion laws in/uni00A0Australia.\nA 2015 Bill \u2013 the Infant Viability Bill \u2013 proposed that \nabortions except for medical emergency be prohibited after 24 weeks and that abortions after 20 weeks only be performed in such a way as to give the preborn child the strongest chance of survival. Parliament did not pass this Bill.\nIn 2016 a successful amendment to the Public Health and \nWellbeing Act 2008 provided for safe access zones of 150 metres outside places where abortions are conducted. This change was brought about in response to long-standing harassment from protesters outside abortion clinics. 330 Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

  "Page 346": "10.1  Why laws need to change\nThere has never been a time in the history of Australia\u2019s legal system when the law has \nremained completely static. The legal system consists of institutions that interact with \nsociety as a whole. As society changes, it needs new and different laws. The law can operate effectively only if it re\ufb02  ects the needs and values of the community it seeks to serve. Therefore, the law must change as society\u2019s needs and values change.\nOver the past century we have witnessed rapid change in the structure of our society . \nThe legal system sometimes fi  nds it diffi  cult to keep pace with the pressure for change. Every year, Commonwealth and State parliaments pass more than 1000 Acts. In addition, subordinate bodies make regulations that affect us all. The volume of law grows and the substance of the law changes.\nThere are several factors that tend to create a need for law reform:\n\u2022 changing community attitudes and values\n\u2022 changing expectations of the legal system\u2022 community awareness around particular issues\u2022 the changing needs of government departments\u2022 the changing nature of business\u2022 changing technology\u2022 changes in our international relationships.Laws need to change \nto re/f_l  ect the needs and values of the community.\n 338 Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 347": "Changing community attitudes \nand\u00a0values\nChanges in society and community attitudes can result in a need to change the law . There \nhave been signifi  cant changes in the community over the past 100 years, including those listed in the table below .\nTable 10.1 Some signi/f_i  cant changes in the community over the past 100 years\nThen Now\nAverage life expectancy: 47 years Average life expectancy: 80 years (men) and 84/uni00A0years (women)\nHorseback Cars and aeroplanes\nGaslights Electric streetlights\nPen and paper Computers \nChalkboards Interactive whiteboards and e-learning systems\nBoard games Electronic games \u2013 Wii and X-box\nSilent movies Digital TV, DVDs, iPhones, tablets and the internet\nCompass GPS navigation systems\nWood-burning stoves Microwave ovens\nAlong with these changes, there have also been changes in community attitudes and \nvalues. For instance, 100 years ago, marriage was valued as a lifelong commitment. Under \nthe Matrimonial Causes Act 1959 (Cth), divorce was a matter of attributing fault to one of the parties.\nToday we recognise that marriage breakdown is not necessarily the fault of one \nperson. The Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) altered the law on divorce to recognise this change \nin attitude. Today a divorce can be obtained if the marriage has \u2018irretrievably broken down\u2019, as evidenced by a separation of 12 months. Changing attitudes to relationships are also re\ufb02  ected in the increasing recognition of de facto and same-sex relationships in our\u00a0laws.\nOver 100 years ago children were seen almost as the property of their parents. \nChildren could be put to work at an early age. Today we value the rights of children as being separate from, and different from, the rights of parents. Today our courts see the interests of the child as paramount in determining parenting issues. Various laws have been introduced to protect children from abuse and provide for access to education.\nIn recent years there has also been increasing concern for the protection of the \nenvironment.\nNEWSREPORT  10.1 \nEndangered species list grows\nFORTY/hyphen.capNINE PLANTS AND ANIMALS  \non the brink of extinction have been \nadded to the Federal government\u2019s endangered species list.\nThis means that they are given \nextra protection under Australian environmental laws.

We are also seeing growing community support for the concept of a Bill of Rights. In 2006, the Victorian parliament passed the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities, which recognised the basic rights of people living in Victoria.\nSometimes an event occurs which is not consistent with the values of the community . \nSuch an event can result in demands for changes in the law . For instance, the tragic events in Bourke Street in January 2017 resulted in demands to protect the community from harm.\nNEWSREPORT  10.2 \nReviewing Victoria\u2019s bail law\nIN JANUARY 2017, THE VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED THAT THE BAIL  \nlaws were being examined by a former Supreme Court judge. This review followed \nthe deaths of and injuries to a number of pedestrians who were struck by a car on Bourke Street Mall and other sections of the street.\nPolice alleged that the driver, Dimitrious Gargasoulas, 26, deliberately struck the people.Despite police objections, Gargasoulas had been granted bail by a bail justice 6 days \nearlier. For more than 20 years bail justices \u2013 a uniquely Victorian system \u2013 have been used for after-hours bail applications. They are trained volunteers who must be Australian citizens and not insolvent.\nFollowing the tragedy, the Police Association called for bail justices to be replaced by \non-call magistrates. The Herald Sun newspaper asked readers to \u2018join our /f_i  ght to /f_i  x bail \nlaws\u2019 . The government announced the establishment of a night court for magistrates to hear after-hours bail requests.\nState Coroner Sara Hinchey investigated the tragedy, including how Gargasoulas had \nbeen released on bail and the justice system.\nIt has been claimed that Victoria has one of the lowest remand-in-custody rates in \nAustralia because of the bail justice system. It has also been said that denial of bail is a factor in Australia\u2019s growing prisoner numbers. In the September 2016 quarter, the average number of full-time prisoners in Australia was almost 39,000 \u2013 of these, 32% are classi/f_i  ed as unsentenced (that is, they had been con/f_i  ned to custody or supervision awaiting the outcome of their trial).\nLaws need to change \nto re/f_l  ect community expectations that the law will regulate behaviour and protect the community from harm. 340  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 349": "Changing expectations of the \nlegal\u00a0system\nOur attitude to the role of law and government in the community is also changing. One \nhundred years ago the community expected the law to clearly regulate behaviour \u2013 that is, to set out what could and could not be done. Today we expect the legal system to take a far more active role \u2013 not only stating the rights of individuals but also protecting individuals from harm.\nAn example of this is the compulsory wearing of bicycle helmets for cyclists. The \nlaw cannot stop all road accidents; however, wearing helmets can minimise the harm. These laws are enforced by the police and are generally recognised by the community as a justifi  able intrusion on their personal liberty . However, not all countries have compulsory\u00a0helmet legislation. For instance, in the United States, only 22 States have bicycle helmet laws. Although the positive effects of wearing helmets are recognised, there is strong community resistance. This resistance re\ufb02  ects a different community attitude to the role of government. That attitude is that government (or law) should not interfere with personal liberty \u2013 that is, the personal right to decide whether or not to wear\u00a0a helmet.\nNEWSREPORT  10.3 \nTobacco in Victoria\nSINCE THE PASSING OF VICTORIA\u2019S TOBACCO ACT  \n1987, parliament has acted to increase the number \nof/uni00A0smoke-free areas in Victoria.\nIncreasing the number of smoke-free areas in Victoria \nis seen as one way to provide a healthy environment for the community. Further moves to regulate smoke-free environments recognise that there is no safe level of exposure to second-hand smoke.\nAs Ms Hennessy (Minister for Health) stated:\n\u201cLet me be clear, our objective is to strive for a smoke-\nfree Victoria to reduce the impact of smoking, which touches us all. This means we will make every e\ufb00  ort to stop Victorians taking up smoking, and to create environments that support smokers to quit and stay/uni00A0quit\u201d . \nThe Tobacco Amendment Act 2016 amended the 1987 \nTobacco Act to introduce a ban on smoking in outdoor dining areas. This means that diners in outdoor areas can now enjoy a meal without being subjected to second-hand smoke. Outdoor dining areas include:\n\u2022 restaurants\u2022 cafes\u2022 takeaway shops\u2022 licensed premises, including beer gardens\u2022 courtyards\u2022 footpath dining\u2022 food fairs\u2022 street festivals.\nThese reforms, came into force on 1 August 2017.

  "Page 350": "Changing community awareness\nPeople are better educated and informed than they were 100 years ago. Individuals \nare more aware of their legal rights and responsibilities. They are therefore more likely to question the law . Today we do not automatically comply with the law or accept the application of outmoded legal principles. Individuals now demand greater involvement in\u00a0the processes of decision-making about the law and its institutions. It is inevitable that this will result in challenges to the law and changes to the law .\nChanging community awareness of individual rights has also resulted in increased \ncommunity demand for access to the law . This can be seen in the growth in the use of alternative dispute resolution methods in areas such as neighbourhood disputes, consumer claims and tenancy . Tribunals have been introduced to meet these demands. There have also been increased demands for legal advice and assistance.Laws need to change \nto re/f_l  ect the increasing community awareness of rights and demands for access to the law.\nNEWSREPORT  10.4 \nMore than a roof over their heads\nTRADITIONALLY , ROOMING /parenleft.capBOARDING/parenright.cap HOUSES  \nhave provided shelter to some of our most \nvulnerable people.

Anyone could/uni00A0run a rooming house provided it was registered with the local council and met a range of other legal requirements.\nIn 2009 the Victorian government established the \nRooming House Standards Taskforce. The Taskforce reported serious concerns about the rooming house industry, including overcrowding, illegal modi/f_i  cations of/uni00A0buildings in order to house more people, excessive rents, inadequate repairs and squalid conditions.\nA key recommendation of the Taskforce was for \nrooming house operators to be registered. This increased regulation would make the operators more accountable.\nThe Rooming House Operators Act 2015 was passed in \n2016. It established a licensing scheme for rooming house operators. Only those people who can satisfy the \u2018/f_i  t and proper person\u2019 test are eligible to be licensed, or to have their existing licences renewed.The criteria for who is a /f_i  t and proper person excludes:\n\u2022 people who have convictions for certain serious o\ufb00  ences: for example, those convicted of o\ufb00  ences involving drugs, violence or dishonesty are not eligible to be licensed, where those convictions were recorded in the 10 years preceding an application for a licence\n\u2022 people with convictions for other serious o\ufb00  ences, \nincluding sexual and child pornography o\ufb00  ences\n\u2022 rooming house operators who have been found by a \ncourt to have contravened speci/f_i  c rooming house-related laws within the preceding 5 years.\nThose operating without a licence face signi/f_i  cant penalties.\nChanging needs of government \ndepartments\nGovernment departments are responsible for the day-to-day administration of \ngovernment policies. They have the power to make a range of important decisions that may affect the rights and responsibilities of individuals.

When you buy a printed book, it comes with all kinds of rights, such as the right to sell or give the book away. However, an eBook comes with a very small subset of rights in a \u2018licence agreement\u2019 . These conditional licences are policed and can be revoked at the discretion of the eBook retailer. A Norwegian Kindle customer discovered this when they allegedly violated Amazon\u2019s terms and conditions and had their digital library deleted. (It was later/uni00A0reinstated.)\nDo you know who owns material on the internet? \nCopyright is about the rights of authors and creators to control how material they produce is used (intellectual property rights) and about how they are attributed as authors of their works (moral rights). Traditionally, copyright is a form of intellectual property. However, technology has brought new means of quickly and cheaply downloading, copying and distributing material. Do our copyright laws adequately balance the rights of authors and creators and the rights of users of new/uni00A0technologies?\nIn 2012, the Australian Law Reform Commission \nconducted an inquiry looking at copyright and the digital economy. The inquiry looked at whether our laws allow for appropriate access, use, interaction and production of copyright material online. The ALRC report was tabled on 13 February 2014. In August, 2015 the Productivity Commission was asked to inquire into Australia\u2019s intellectual property system. The Productivity Commission report was publicly released on 20 December 2016.\nChanges in our international relationships\nOver the past century there have been dramatic changes in the relationships between \nnations. Over 40 years ago, Professor of Law CG Weeramantry wrote:\nIncreasingly nations are dependent on international agreements and cooperation to \nachieve change. It makes little sense to regulate satellite transmissions, atmospheric pollution, DNA research or nuclear proliferation nationally , when all that one nation may do can be negated by its neighbour. It makes little sense to look at global problems such as desertifi  cation or regulation of transnational corporations from the narrow standpoint of national interests. Yet legal systems are still hemmed in and circumscribed by the notion of the nation state.\nThe Commonwealth government has the power to enter into international agreements \n(or\u00a0treaties) under section 51 of the Constitution. However, these international agreements generally do not become law in Australia unless the Commonwealth parliament passes a law giving force to the agreement. The Australian Treaties Library lists over 3000 treaties in force in Australia.\nInternational affairs can also in\ufb02  uence the need to change the law in Australia. \nFollowing terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001, the Commonwealth parliament introduced laws giving police new powers to investigate suspected terrorists. In recent years there has been an increase in the number of refugees arriving by boat in Australia. This has resulted in ongoing debate about the extent to which Australian migration laws re\ufb02  ect our obligations as a signatory to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees\u2019 (UNHCR\u2019s) 1951 Refugee Convention and how our laws deal with asylum-seekers.

New laws develop or existing laws expand to meet these changing needs.\nIn some instances, the law may provide an impetus for social change. For example, \nequal opportunity and anti-discrimination legislation passed in the 1970s and 1980s changed social attitudes to equality . These laws made it an offence to discriminate against a person on the grounds of sex, race or religion: initially , the laws focused on discrimination in employment. Since these laws were fi  rst passed, the categories of discrimination have expanded as society\u2019s attitudes to discrimination have changed.\nOver the past century , increased mobility and education, and the changing nature of \ncommerce and technology , have all brought about a need to change laws and to develop new ones. For example, changes in the nature of production and the sale of goods resulted\u00a0in the need for new laws. These laws set out the rights and responsibilities of consumers, traders and manufacturers in Acts such as the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth), the Consumer Credit (Victoria) and Other Acts Amendment Act 2008 (Vic) and the Australian Consumer Law . The common law of the duty of care developed to extend the rights of consumers.\nWhen the law fails to respond to demands for change, the result is a loss of respect for \nour legal institutions. The public becomes less likely to adhere to the law , and therefore the law cannot provide for social order.\n10.2  Infl  uencing law reform\nAction that in\ufb02  uences law-making bodies to bring about a change in the law can come \nfrom a range of sources: individuals, the media and law reform bodies.\nIndividuals (as well as groups of individuals) can attempt to in\ufb02  uence law-makers \nto change the law . These groups are outside the formal structures of parliament and government. They may take a number of different types of actions to in\ufb02  uence a change: petitions, writing articles to newspapers, creating awareness of an issue using social media, or by demonstrating. Sometimes the media can create pressure by demanding that a law change. Individuals can also use the courts to try to change the law .\nThe actions of law reform bodies can also have a signifi  cant in\ufb02  uence. The Victorian \nLaw Reform Commission was established to assess the need for law reform. Parliamentary committees can be asked by parliament to review an area of law with a view to what changes are needed. Royal commissions can be appointed by the government to review issues. As a result of these reviews, changes in the law may be recommended.\nLaw reform\nIndividuals Media Law reform bodies\nPetitions Traditional media VLRC\nDemonstrations Social media Parliamentary committees\nUse of the courts Royal commissions\nFigure 10.1 In/f_l  uences on law reformIf the law does not \nadapt/uni00A0to changing demands it cannot provide/uni00A0for social order.\nIndividuals, media and law reform bodies can in/f_l  uence the law. 346  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 355": "10.3  Individuals and law reform\nIndividuals and groups can act informally to bring about a change in law in a number of \nways. For example, an individual who seeks to bring about a change in a law can raise awareness through social media, organise a petition, write letters and approach their member of parliament. Individuals or groups can also contribute to the public debate on a particular issue by writing articles, commenting on social media, or writing letters to\u00a0newspapers.\nIndividuals or groups can also act to increase public awareness of a particular \nissue. This can put pressure on individuals within the law-making process, such as members of parliament. Individuals or groups can in\ufb02  uence government policies or present submissions for consideration by formal groups. Groups of individuals who act collectively to raise awareness of the need for law reform are known as pressure groups. For example, a pressure group may present a submission to a parliamentary committee on a proposed\u00a0change.\nTo make effective laws, parliament must determine not only what is acceptable \nto individuals within society but also what is acceptable to society as a whole. As a democratically elected law-making body , parliament is more likely to respond to views that are perceived to be held by the majority of the community . Therefore, the more people there are who appear to be in favour of a particular change, the greater is the likelihood of success.\nChange is therefore likely to occur where groups of individuals take action.\nIndividuals\nAlthough individuals or groups may raise awareness of the need for change, parliament \nmust still assess whether these views re\ufb02  ect those of the majority of the community . For instance, an individual who protests outside parliament about the need for a particular law to be changed may effectively gain the attention of members of parliament. However, does that person represent the interests of the majority of people?\nWhile everyone has the right to present a reasoned argument for a change in the law , \nindividuals acting alone are likely to have a limited impact on changing the law .\nParliament responds to what are perceived to be the demands of the majority of \npeople. Therefore, the greater the number of people who appear to be in favour of a particular change, the greater the likelihood of success.\nNEWSREPORT  10.7 \nLong walk for war powers reform\nAUSTRALIA\u2019S CONSTITUTION DOES  \nnot require parliamentary approval \nto go to war or send troops overseas.\nFollowing the Westminster \ntradition, Australia\u2019s Federal executive government \u2013 the Prime Minister and Cabinet \u2013 has the ultimate responsibility for these decisions.\nThe UK has recently developed the \npractice of seeking the authorisation of the House of Commons, requiring a parliamentary debate before any decision to deploy military force is/uni00A0made.\nA Victorian man, journalist Michael \nSmith, believes Australia should review its approach to this. Representing Australians for War Powers Reform, he walked from his hometown, Chewton, to Canberra, carrying proposed legislation drafted by a team of international lawyers. It states that a resolution to go to war or deploy forces/uni00A0overseas must be approved by both houses of parliament.\nSeveral politicians greeted him in \nCanberra, with Labor\u2019s Lisa Chesters later in the day delivering a speech in parliament commending Mr Smith\u2019s e\ufb00  orts and urging discussion of the war power issue.Individuals and groups \noften act outside the formal structures of parliament to in/f_l  uence law reform.\nAn individual has a limited in/f_l  uence on changing the law, as parliament re/f_l  ects majority views.

  "Page 356": "Another diffi  culty experienced by individuals who want to change the law is knowing \nthe appropriate law-making body . For example, a person wanting to change the law on the importation of hazardous wastes would need to know who makes that law: the Commonwealth parliament or a State parliament? They would also need to be aware of the government policies in the area of law that they wish to change.\nThe standing of the person in the community may also be important. A person who \nis a recognised authority on a subject may have a great in\ufb02  uence in bringing about a change. For example, the opinions of an environmental scientist may be highly in\ufb02  uential in bringing about a reform in the law that protects endangered species. Members of the legal profession deal with the law on a day-to-day basis; they are likely to be aware of the need for law reform and may comment on the effectiveness of a particular law by writing articles in newspapers or professional journals.\nPressure groups\nChange is more likely to occur if people act together. Pressure groups can use many of the methods used by individuals. The advantage of a pressure group is that the spokesperson can claim that they represent a large proportion of the community; this may mean that it is more likely that the law-making body will take action. Pressure groups take a variety of forms. They may be small groups, or they may be large organisations. Pressure groups are sometimes called lobby groups.\nInterest groups\nThere are pressure groups that represent a particular cause or issue. An example of a single-issue pressure group is the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society , which uses direct action tactics to protect marine life. Animal Rights Victoria campaigns against the abuse of animals. Amnesty International Australia is a pressure group concerned with human rights. Amnesty campaigns for changes in Australia\u2019s anti-terrorism laws and for a Human Rights\u00a0Act.\nAMNESTY INTERNATIONAL  \nAUSTRALIA\nAmnesty International Australia is part of a global movement defending human \nrights. To do this, we mobilise people, campaign, conduct research and\u00a0raise \nmoney for our work. We\u00a0are promoting a culture where human rights are embraced, valued and protected. \n For more \ninformation \nabout Amnesty International Australia, go to https://www.amnesty.org.au.Groups of individuals acting together are more likely to in/f_l  uence a change in the law.

  "Page 357": "Industry groups\nSome pressure groups, such as Clubs Australia, representing licensed clubs, represent \nthe interests of a particular industry group. In its efforts to oppose further legal controls on gambling, the organisation ran a \u2018Part of the Solution\u2019 campaign, telling the public about the actions the industry takes to reduce problem gambling: staff training, self-exclusion programs, no credit betting and counselling services, for example.\nProfessional groups\nProfessional groups are also concerned with changes in the law in their area. For instance, the Australian Medical Association (AMA) represents the interests of doctors. It has expressed views on a range of medical issues, such as laws relating to child abuse, access to health care and health policies.\nThe legal profession also in\ufb02  uences change in the legal system. Lawyers are \nrepresented by organisations such as the Victorian Bar, the Criminal Bar Association and the Law Institute of Victoria. These associations can become aware of a need for a change in the law , and draw the attention of the government to this need. They can also act against a proposed change. Lawyers throughout Australia are also members of the Law Council of Australia, which performs a similar function at a Commonwealth level.\nTHE CLIMATE AND \nHEALTH \u00a0ALLIANCE\nThe Climate and Health Alliance (CAHA) is a coalition of health care stakeholders \nwho work together to see the threat to human health from climate change and ecological degradation addressed through prompt policy action.

  "Page 358": "NEWSREPORT  10.8 \nHow e\ufb00  ective are pressure groups?\nThe e\ufb00  ectiveness of action taken by pressure groups \ndepends on a variety of factors. These factors include the determination of the pressure group, the strength of resistance, the degree of media coverage and the level of public sympathy. For example, in March 2011 Animals Australia* (\u2018the voice for animals\u2019) investigator Lyn White visited 11 abattoirs to assess the treatment and slaughter of Australian cattle in four Indonesian cities. Footage shot by Ms White of animals being inhumanely slaughtered was screened on the current a\ufb00  airs program Four Corners. The ensuing scandal sent shockwaves from the plains of the outback to the highest o\ufb03   ce of politics. Within days, a Federal government decree \u2013 ceasing to issue export licences \u2013 brought Australia\u2019s lucrative live cattle trade to Indonesia to a shuddering halt. The fallout continues in both countries. Though the export ban was short-lived, it fractured crucial trade relations, cost the industry untold millions, and caused cultural o\ufb00  ence to our near neighbours. Since then, Animals Australia and the RSPCA have actively campaigned for further restrictions on the export of live animals. In 2016, newly elected Senator Derryn Hinch a\ufb03   rmed his position on animal welfare:\nSeeing our cattle being sledgehammered to death in \nVietnam was an atrocity \u2026 I\u2019ve had all the arguments put forward to me, but I still believe we should keep building the frozen export industry.His stance is hardly a surprise \u2013 Sen. Hinch delivered his \n/f_i  rst petition calling for an end to live exports in 1981 \u2013 but/uni00A0he\u2019s also a realist: \u2018It ain\u2019t going to change anytime soon, not with Barnyard Barnaby in there now,\u2019 he says breezily, of the federal Agriculture Minister. \u2018I\u2019m fairly practical, I know what can and cannot happen \u2026 but I will/uni00A0be pushing it.\u2019\n*See Animals Australia and RSPCA Australia joint campaign website: \nwww.banliveexport.com.\n10.4   Methods used by individuals \nand groups\nA number of methods may be used. They include:\n\u2022 signing a petition to parliament\n\u2022 participating in demonstrations\u2022 taking cases to court\u2022 using the media, including social media.\nOther actions to in\ufb02  uence a change in the law include:\n\u2022 preparing submissions to law reform bodies, parliamentary committees or other \nbodies investigating changes in the law\n\u2022 civil disobedience\u2022 political action\u2022 direct approaches to members of parliament (lobbying).\nPetitions\nIndividuals and groups can use petitions to in\ufb02  uence parliament to change the law . A petition  \nis a written request that parliament or the government take action on an issue. In both the \nCommonwealth and State parliament a member of parliament may present a petition to parliament on behalf of the people in their electorate. During each sitting of parliament, the president or speaker will ask members to read out petitions.

For instance, the House of Representatives accepts electronic or internet-based petitions. The Senate allows electronic petitions only if a senator certi/f_i  es that the text was/uni00A0available to all signatories, and it must be lodged as a paper document.\nMore than 50,000 petitions to the \nHouse of Representatives have been lodged since Federation.

  "Page 360": "E-petitions\nE-petition systems allow individuals to submit petitions, to share information about \npetitions on social networks and to sign existing petitions online. Both e-petitions and paper petitions must be set out according to the rules set by the relevant parliament.\nE-petitions are also used by groups in the community to demonstrate general support \nfor particular issues in the community . Online sites such as Change.org. and GetUp have been instrumental in in\ufb02  uencing change. Change.org claimed that 174,979,035 people had taken action on their site by December 2016. For instance, a petition supporting the legalisation of the right of same-sex couples in South Australia to adopt children gained the support of 27,000 people. In December 2016 South Australia changed the law to allow same-sex adoption.\nThe Commonwealth House of Representatives allows individuals to create a petition on \nthe House\u2019s e-petition website. The Petitions Committee checks petitions to make sure that they comply with the rules. The petition is then placed on the House\u2019s e-petition website for 4 weeks, to collect signatures. When the e-petition closes, it will be presented to the House of Representatives by the Chair of the Petitions Committee or your local member.\nIn November 2016, the Procedures Committee of the Victorian Legislative Council \nreported on the adoption of e-petitions. The Committee recommended an online process that replicated the existing paper petitions process. The Committee proposed a pilot program, to be reviewed after 12 months. Under this pilot, an individual can create and lodge an e-petition request online via the Victorian parliament\u2019s website. Publication of a new e-petition is reviewed by the Clerk to ensure that it complies with the rules. The e-petition is posted on the Victorian parliament\u2019s website for a period of not less than 1\u00a0week and not more than 6 months.\nDemonstrations\nIndividuals or groups may also organise a demonstration, perhaps taking the form of a march or a rally . Australia has a long history of demonstrations as a means of expressing a political opinion. Following the 1854 Eureka uprising, 10,000 people protested in the streets of Melbourne. (At that time 10,000 people was about one-third of the total population of Melbourne.) Anti-Vietnam War marches in the 1970s attracted up to 100,000\u00a0protesters and had a signifi  cant impact on Australian political policies.\nFigure 10.2 Lawyers rally for legal aid justiceIndividuals and groups \ncan hold demonstrations, such as rallies or marches, to in/f_l  uence a change in the law. 352  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 361": "In another example, in 2016, lawyers joined with retired Supreme Court Justice Betty \nKing to protest over proposed changes to legal aid. Lawyers rallied in Melbourne\u2019s CBD \nto demonstrate their concerns about successive cuts to Legal Aid and community legal services. In addressing the protest, Justice King spoke about the impact of the cuts on those who are vulnerable:\nIt cannot be a fair system when only one side gets the money to be represented \nin court. The Commonwealth continues to increase funding to investigating organisations such as the AFP , ASIC or even creating new paramilitary organisations such as Border Force. But it continues to reduce the funding that could remotely balance that system.\nBoycotts\nA boycott is another type of group \naction, but it is one that is invisible on the streets. A\u00a0boycott may be a refusal to buy an item or to participate in a particular activity . For instance, the RSPCA (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) encouraged people not to buy puppies from puppy farms. The State parliament reacted by introducing the Domestic Animals Amendment (Puppy Farms and Pet Shops) Bill 2016. This Bill proposed\u00a0to:\n\u2022 regulate the number of fertile \nfemale dogs kept by breeding domestic animal businesses\n\u2022 further regulate the breeding of \ndogs and cats and sale of dogs and cats in pet shops\n\u2022 provide for the registration of \nfoster carers and single-use permits to sell certain animals.\nDemonstrations may be legal or they may involve behaviour that is outside the law . Violent demonstrations are a violation of the law and can represent a danger to the wider\u00a0community .\nThe use of the courts\nParliament is the supreme law-making body . Reforming the law is not the primary role of the courts. The role of courts in law-making is discussed in more detail in Chapter 9. However, there are a number of ways in which individuals can use the courts to try to change the law .\nAn individual can take a case for which there is no applicable precedent or statute law \nto court. Courts can perform a law-making role when hearing a case where no legislation or binding precedent applies. In these cases, the courts will make a decision as to the principles that should be applied in order to resolve the dispute. The decision in the case is binding on the parties to the dispute, and the principles applied are a guide as to how future disputes will be decided.\nUntil a new precedent is set, or parliament passes a law in relation to that particular \nmatter, the precedent applies only to future \u2018like\u2019 cases. Through judicial decisions the courts can reform the law . The rules of common law allow judges to reform laws by setting\u00a0new precedents when an appropriate case comes before them.Individuals and groups \nmay defy the law to demonstrate their disapproval of a law.\nAn individual can take a case for which there is no applicable precedent or statute law to court.\n Chapter 10  Reforming the/uni00A0law 353\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

People contact \nnewspapers with their concerns, writing a letter to the editor. They may also participate \nin\u00a0television or radio interviews and discussions.\nA spokesperson for a pressure group may be interviewed for a current affairs \ntelevision program, or their actions may be reported as part of regular news broadcasts. Alternatively , a pressure group can raise enough money to mount a media campaign of its own, running advertisements in newspapers and magazines or television, or arranging for material to be delivered by mail.\nIn recent years social media has emerged as a powerful tool to in\ufb02  uence reforms in \nthe law . Groups and individuals participate in blogs and discussion forums and can set up websites to promote discussion of issues. Social networking sites, such as Facebook, can also be used to gather support for a change in the law .\nSometimes the media itself acts as a pressure group to help bring about a change in \nthe law . From time to time newspapers and current affairs radio and television programs conduct special investigations into issues of concern.Individuals and groups \ncan use the media to communicate their views to others.\nSocial media is a powerful in/f_l  uence, increasing access and allowing individuals greater scope to express their views.\nThe media can also form \na pressure group acting to/uni00A0bring about change. 356 Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

  "Page 367": "NEWSREPORT  10.14\nGoing to the dogs \u2013 greyhound racing changes\nThe issue\nTWO TV INVESTIGATIVE PROGRAMS FOUND  \nwidespread cheating threatened the welfare of \ngreyhounds and other animals.\nBackground\nGreyhound racing was brought to its knees following two TV investigative programs. At one stage, NSW legislated to ban greyhound racing.\nThe ABC\u2019s Four Corners probe found widespread \ncheating threatened the welfare of the dogs and other animals. The program showed live piglets, possums and rabbits being /f_i  xed to mechanical lures to be chased and eventually killed by dogs.\nWith some $4 billion being bet each year on more than \n40,000 races featuring over 300,000 dogs, the Australian industry had to be cleaned up.\nFollowing the Four Corners program, the RSPCA, in \nconjunction with police in NSW, Queensland and Victoria, raided /f_i  ve properties. As a result, people were prosecuted for using live bait. This is cheating under the laws of greyhound racing.\nLater, an investigation by ABC\u2019s 7.30 found that \nhundreds of Australian greyhounds deemed to be too slow were exported to Asia, breaching racing rules.\nReactions\nFollowing the Four Corners program, the NSW government set up an inquiry. The inquiry found that live baiting was \u2018rampant and chronic\u2019 and \u2018/f_i  rmly enmeshed\u2019 . It also found that 50\u201370% of dogs born in the past 12 months had been killed because they never, or no longer, were capable of being competitive.\nThe NSW government acted, legislating to ban \ngreyhound racing, threatening the livelihoods of thousands of people \u2013 from racecourse sta\ufb00   to pet food suppliers. The NSW Greyhound Racing Industry Alliance was formed to /f_i  ght the NSW government decision. The united industry bodies included the NSW Greyhound Breeders, Owners and Trainers\u2019 Association, all independent racing clubs, and other industry participants. The alliance, representing about 15,000 people, organised rallies, used social media to spread its message, and actively campaigned in a by-election.\nAlthough almost two-thirds of people in NSW and \nthe ACT supported the ban, the decision became a political hot potato. The Baird Government, surprisingly, did a back/f_l  ip and reversed the ban following industry and political pressure. The government announced a suite of changes, ranging from life bans and increased jail terms for live baiting to additional resources for enforcement and prosecution of wrongdoers. But this reversal was too late to save the National Party\u2019s seat of Orange in a by-election \u2013 the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party won its /f_i  rst seat in the Lower House. This by-election re/f_l  ected the discontent of rural voters and sent shockwaves across the/uni00A0nation.\nAcross the Murray, the Coalition for the Protection of \nGreyhounds ran an online petition calling for a ban on the Victorian greyhound industry.\nThe Greyhound Racing Victoria (GRV) board resigned \nafter the Four Corners report. The Victorian government established two independent inquiries with the reports tabled in parliament. The report of the Racing Integrity Commissioner recommended removing integrity and regulatory functions from GRV and establishing an authority to perform this function for all three racing codes. At least one member of the GRV board should also be required to have animal welfare expertise.\nThe Chief Veterinary O\ufb03   cer\u2019s report emphasised the \nneed for auditing and inspection to be undertaken by an independent inspectorate, as well as strengthening the powers of inspectors under the Domestic Animals Act 1994 and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1986, and requiring greyhound racing participants to register with municipal councils as domestic animal businesses.\nOutcomes in Victoria\nThe government responded to the inquiries by passing the Racing and Other Acts Amendment (Greyhound Racing and Welfare Reform) Act 2015, which sets out the functions and rules of Greyhound Racing Victoria, and makes changes to its constitution and its appeals and disciplinary board, sets out additional functions for the Racing Integrity Commissioner regarding animal welfare, creates o\ufb00  ences relating to using animals as lures in greyhound races, makes a range of changes to animal welfare arrangements in the greyhound racing sector, and makes other miscellaneous amendments.\nSubsequently Greyhound Racing Victoria addressed \nthe 68 recommendations made in the two reports. These included a 400% increase in animal welfare inspectors, a new investigations unit, a doubling of sampling for prohibited substances, a crackdown on greyhound exports, and a substantial program of engagement with industry/uni00A0participants.\n Chapter 10  Reforming the/uni00A0law 359\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 368": "NEWSREPORT  10.15\nNewspaper\u2019s electronic campaign to send drug drivers to jail\nONE OF THE GREATEST NEWSPAPER CAMPAIGNS \nwaged in Australia was \u2018Declare War on 1034\u2019 . \nConducted by the Sun News-Pictorial (now the Herald Sun), the /f_i  gure 1034 was the number of people killed on Victoria\u2019s roads in 1969. It went to 1061 the following year but then trended down. The campaign led to the passage of .05% blood-alcohol laws, random breath testing and compulsory/uni00A0seatbelts.\nSince then there have been public action and \neducation programs targeting speed, drink and drug-a\ufb00  ected driving and fatigue, and the Arrive Alive strategy, which included plans to make roads and vehicles safer.\nIn 2016 there were 291 fatalities, an increase of \n15.5% on the previous year.\nThe change sparked a new campaign by the \nnewspaper. Claiming that drug-drivers are behind the/uni00A0increase because of a legal loophole, the Herald/uni00A0Sun mounted a campaign to have drug-driver laws changed.\nThe campaign asked readers to sign an online \npetition. It also used social media platforms such as/uni00A0Twitter.\nThe newspaper published /f_i  gures for 2015\u201316: \nof 8536 drug-drivers caught, 40% (3477) had a prior conviction for the same o\ufb00  ence; 45 drivers killed in road crashed in 2015 had drugs in their system, compared with 26 drunk-drivers. In the same year, 632 drivers were seriously injured after being involved in a crash while on drugs.\nThe centrepiece of the campaign was the \nnewspaper\u2019s claim that sentencing laws do not allow magistrates to put repeat drug-drivers in jail, regardless of how many times they o\ufb00  end. Recidivist drink-drivers can be sentenced to jail after repeatedly being caught over the .05 limit. Drink-drivers with readings between .07 and .10 can be disquali/f_i  ed from driving for 6 months, while drug-drivers lose their licence for 3 months. Drink-drivers also have their licence suspended on the spot while drug-drivers don\u2019t.\nHowever, the online Victorian Tra\ufb03   c Law Forum \nchallenged the campaign. The forum, which provides discussion of road and vehicle-related issues, said there were laws to jail people who drive while drug-a\ufb00  ected. It/uni00A0cited:\n\u2022 Road Safety Act s 49(1)(a) \u2013 a serious drug-driving o\ufb00  ence can carry 3 months\u2019 imprisonment for a /f_i  rst o\ufb00  ence, and up to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment if there is more than one prior driving or drug-driving o\ufb00  ence;\n\u2022 Road Safety Act s 49(1)(ba) \u2013 12 months\u2019 jail for any previous drink or drug-driving o\ufb00  ences, and 18 months\u2019 jail if there are two or more drink or drug-driving prior o\ufb00  ences;\n\u2022 there are jail options for \u2018cocktail law\u2019 breaches;\u2022 a 4-year interlock is possible, but only for \nsomeone who has prior o\ufb00  ences in the last 10 years; and\n\u2022 a 6\u201318 month jail term can be imposed on \nsomeone who has had any prior o\ufb00  ences, no matter when.\nThe forum believes that the Herald Sun\u2019s argument is about the oral /f_l  uid test \u2013 people cannot go to jail no matter how many times they fail this test. The test is designed to detect trace elements of drugs in a person\u2019s body. It is not designed to determine whether or not the drug impairs a person. The organisation says that until the concentration of a drug can be equated to a level of impairment, it is unrealistic to jail people who may be unaware that their body contains trace elements of a drug that could have been taken some days earlier.\nRoads Minister Luke Donnellan said any change \nin/uni00A0law needed to be \u2018bulletproof\u2019 to avoid challenges in court.\n 360  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

Individuals or groups can make direct approaches to members of parliament to express their views on an issue. Alternatively , they can prepare submissions to parliamentary inquiries or law reform bodies. In some instances, individuals or groups may express their disapproval for a law by not obeying the law (civil disobedience). Individuals can also take political actions such as voting, joining a political party or standing for parliament.\nDirect approaches\nAn individual or group may approach a member of parliament to express their concerns \nabout the need for action.\nThis direct approach method is also known as lobbying. Sometimes organisations and \npressure groups employ professional lobbyists to make direct approaches and present arguments for change.\nPreparing submissions\nAny individual or group trying to in\ufb02  uence change can write submissions to various \norganisations. Formal bodies are set up by governments and parliaments to review the need for changes in the law . These include law reform commissions, royal commissions, boards of inquiry and parliamentary committees. Before a new inquiry begins, an announcement will often be made in newspapers. It will explain the purpose of the inquiry and invite any interested people to make submissions.\nAlthough these bodies cannot directly change the law , they can and do make \nrecommendations based on the submissions they receive.Direct approaches include \npersonal contact, letters, emails and phone calls.\nIndividuals and groups can write submissions to formal law reform bodies.\n Chapter 10  Reforming the/uni00A0law 361\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 370": "Civil disobedience\nIn demonstrating their view on an issue, some groups may deliberately break the law . This \nis sometimes done in order to bring attention to their cause. When there is a large group of people dissatisfi  ed with an issue, civil disobedience can become so disruptive that the government is forced to respond. However, groups pursuing such action take a risk. If the community perceives their actions as violent, threatening or unacceptable, they may lose support for their cause. Furthermore, if their actions are unlawful they may end up in court facing criminal charges.\nNEWSREPORT  10.16 \nGarden goes to pot\nFOR AT LEAST 6 YEARS HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WOULD GATHER IN MELBOURNE\u2019S  \nFlagsta\ufb00   Gardens to take part in pot-smoking picnics, run by pro-legislation \ncampaigners Free Cannabis Community.\nAlthough it is illegal to smoke cannabis, police liaised with the organisers and used \ntheir discretion to let the picnics run until \u2026 calls from the community, the opposition and the media pressured Victoria Police to act and stop the event.\nParticipating in the political process\nAn individual can try to in\ufb02  uence a change in the law by directly participating in the \npolitical process. This can include voting, joining a political party and standing for election.\nVoting\nAn individual can demonstrate support for a change in the law at an election. When we \nvote for a candidate we demonstrate support for the policies they have presented to the electorate. When they are elected to parliament we expect that they will implement those policies, which sometimes means changing the law .\nStanding for election\nAn individual who wants to in\ufb02  uence change in the law may stand for election to State or Federal parliament. They can be either an independent candidate or a representative of a\u00a0political party .\nJoining or forming a political party\nAn individual does not have to stand for election to in\ufb02  uence the decisions made by political parties; they can join a political party . Joining a political party gives the individual two ways of in\ufb02  uencing change:\n\u2022 by in\ufb02  uencing the types of policies that are developed by the political party , and\n\u2022 by becoming involved in the process used to select candidates to represent the \nparty at the next election.\nAlternatively , an individual can form a political party with the express purpose of \nin\ufb02  uencing a change in the law . For instance, the Shooters Party promotes the right to own\u00a0and use a fi  rearm for legitimate purposes, including self-defence.Individuals can use \npolitical processes \u2013 such as voting, joining or forming a political party, and standing for election \u2013 to in/f_l  uence the law. 362  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

The petition and the number of signatures are recorded in Hansard.Petitions are easy to organise and provide for a peaceful means to in/f_l  uence change. A petition can draw parliament\u2019s attention to an issue. However, once a petition has been presented there is no guarantee that parliament will take any further action. The number of signatures indicating support for the petition may in/f_l  uence members of parliament.\nDemonstrations Taking action to publicly display support for a particular issue. This may take the form of a march or/uni00A0rally.\nA boycott \u2013 a refusal to buy an item or participate in \na particular activity \u2013 is another way to demonstrate dissatisfaction and press for a change to the law.Demonstrations draw attention to an issue, demonstrate the extent of public support and attract media attention. However, if the demonstration involves acts of violence or unlawful acts it may result in adverse media attention and reduce community support.\nBoycotts are only effective if a large number of \npeople agree to take the action.\nUse of the courts An individual could:\n \u00b7challenge the validity of legislation\n \u00b7challenge the interpretation of the law\n \u00b7take a case to court that sets a new precedent.\nA judge hearing a case may identify a problem and/uni00A0call for a reform in the law.Effectiveness is likely to be limited by costs, time and opportunity to take a court action.\nUsually only wealthy or large bodies have the \nresources to challenge the law. Alternatively, an individual may be a member of a class action.\nCourt decisions may highlight the need for a reform \nin the law but it is parliament that has to respond.\nThe conservative nature of some judges may limit the \ncapacity of the courts to reform the law.\nRole of the media, \nincluding social media:\n \u00b7letter to the editor\n \u00b7article\n \u00b7participating in radio \nor television interviews and debates\n \u00b7taking out advertisements\n \u00b7creating a webpage, blog, YouTube video etcCreating public awareness of a point of view to inform a broader audience of your views and to raise/uni00A0awareness of an issue.The use of the media can create public awareness of an issue and increase support. By using the media, individuals and groups can demonstrate public support for their view. The effectiveness of this method may be limited because:\n \u00b7there are some controls on traditional media and they do not always publish or broadcast the views of all groups or consider particular issues. However, online media provide opportunities for individuals to self-publish their views\n \u00b7views expressed in the media may re/f_l  ect the views of vocal minorities\n \u00b7the argument may not be expressed well or persuasively.\nDirect approach Making direct contact with a member of parliament and expressing your concern.

It is likely to be more effective if the member of parliament believes that there is great support for the issue in the community.\nProfessional lobbyists have experience in presenting \na point of view and know the most appropriate ways to in/f_l  uence the law-making process. However, professional lobbyists are expensive.\nCivil disobedience Demonstrating dissatisfaction with the law by breaking the law.This draws attention to the issue, demonstrates a strong commitment and may gain media attention. However, an individual who breaks the law may face prosecution.\nSubmissions Presenting a written statement on an issue to a formal law reform body.A submission makes your view known to a formal body involved in the law reform process. A formal law reform body is more likely to be in/f_l  uenced by submissions that represent authoritative groups or have broad public/uni00A0support.\nTaking political action:\n \u00b7voting\n \u00b7joining a political party/pressure group\n \u00b7standing for electionVoting demonstrates support for a particular view. The aim is for those elected to bring about a change in the law once they are in parliament.\nJoining a party/pressure group that shares the same \nviews and supporting the actions taken to bring about a change.Voting does not necessarily result in a change in the law, but if you are elected you can demonstrate that there is support for your issue.\nIn order to change the law you will also require the \nsupport of the majority of members in both houses.\nBy joining a pressure group or political party you can \nget involved in action to demonstrate widespread support for an issue.

Being a decision-maker in a governing \nbody means being exposed to pressure from a broad range of pressure groups. These groups are a way for ordinary citizens to in/f_l  uence the decision-making process. Similarly, parliament can be better informed of the electorate\u2019s sensitivities to issues because of the arguments put by these groups.\nHow pressure groups work\nPressure groups use a variety of methods to pursue their/uni00A0goals:\n\u2022 lobbying politicians and parliament using petitions, \nletters and deputations (usually politicians gauge community interest through emails and letters \u2013 each letter/email received represents the concerns of approximately 100/uni00A0constituents)\n\u2022 consulting with ministers or senior public servants\u2022 hiring professional lobbyists\u2022 taking legal action through injunctions or appeals to \nhigher courts\n\u2022 campaigning for or opposing certain candidates at \nelections\n\u2022 demonstrating outside parliament and government \no\ufb03   ces or marching in the streets.\nGovernments respond to/uni00A0pressure\nThe /f_i  ngerprints of some pressure groups can be seen on particular pieces of legislation. For instance, our shop trading laws have been in/f_l  uenced by various groups. Under these laws, Good Friday is a public holiday and shops are not/uni00A0permitted to open. Easter Saturday is also a public holiday, but all shops may trade. Easter Sunday is not a public holiday but is a non-trading day, with special exceptions applying. On Easter Sunday, cafes, takeaway food outlets, video shops, hardware stores, chemists, nurseries and service stations may open. Major retailers, such as supermarkets and department stores, may not.

This body can undertake a detailed investigation into the need for a change in the law . A law reform body can assess community attitudes and opinions, and report on the need for change. However, this body only makes recommendations for action. If the recommendations are accepted, parliament may change the law . Law reform bodies include the Victorian Law Reform Commission, royal commissions and parliamentary committees.\n10.8   Victorian Law Reform \nCommission (VLRC)\nThe Victorian Law Reform Commission (VLRC) was established in 2001 by the Victorian \nLaw Reform Commission Act 2000 (Vic). The VLRC is an independent, government-funded \nbody responsible for developing, monitoring and coordinating law reform activity in Victoria.\nThe VLRC was established by the Victorian parliament to investigate issues and \nrecommend possible changes in the law . It consists of a full-time chairperson, full-time and part-time members, and support staff. The commission may also employ consultants to assist in the preparation of inquiries.\nRole\nGenerally , the role of the VLRC is to:\n\u2022 examine, report and make recommendations to the Attorney-General on any \nproposal or matter relating to law reform in Victoria that is referred to the commission by the Attorney-General\n\u2022 examine, report and make recommendations to the Attorney-General on any matter \nthat the commission believes raises relatively minor legal issues that are of general community concern\n\u2022 present to the Attorney-General a proposal or matter relating to law reform in \nVictoria.\nThe VLRC also has a role in providing educational programs in relation to law reform and possible changes in the law .

The Attorney-General will set out the issues to be investigated in a \nstatement known as a reference.\nMembers of the community can initiate community law reform projects. Individuals or \ngroups may identify minor problems in the law . The commission will consider whether the matter is in the public interest and whether it can be undertaken as a community law reform project. Alternatively , the commission may refer the matter to the Attorney-General as a possible reference.\nThe commission consults widely with people who may be affected by proposed \nreforms, and with individuals and groups who have expertise in the area. The commission uses a variety of approaches to assess community views, including:\n\u2022 preparing discussion papers\n\u2022 publishing issues papers\u2022 preparing research papers\u2022 conducting surveys\u2022 engaging specialist consultants\u2022 inviting public submissions\u2022 conducting private and public meetings\u2022 conducting personal interviews.\nThe commission reports to the Attorney-General on law reform proposals.

ITS MAIN  \naims are to review the law and to suggest possible reforms to the law. The VLRC is committed to providing inclusive law reform, independent of the political process. To achieve this aim, the VLRC publishes reports and discussion papers on matters referred to it for consideration. The VLRC can also consider community law reform/uni00A0projects.\nWhy do we need a law reform commission?\nFirst, we need a law reform commission to provide for a full investigation of the law. We/uni00A0need to understand the content of the law and the fundamental legal principles. The/uni00A0VLRC can provide a comprehensive investigation of an entire area of law.\nAlso, a law reform commission allows for a broadly based public consultation process. \nThe process aims to enhance the cohesiveness of the law. It strengthens legal principles and improves people\u2019s understanding of the law. People can then feel con/f_i  dent that parliament is making laws that represent the will of the people.\nThe VLRC uses a community consultation approach to assessing the need for change \nin/uni00A0the law. Community consultation includes submissions, public hearings and community education. At the same time, it draws upon the work of specialists, academic lawyers and legal practitioners.\nHas it been successful?\nHow successful has the VLRC been? It is di\ufb03   cult to measure. It is important to remember that the VLRC is a law reform body, but it cannot change the law. The Attorney-General refers matters to the VLRC and therefore the investigations of the VLRC are likely to have government support. The VLRC makes recommendations for actions in its reports. However, investigations can take time and a change in the law only occurs if parliament passes legislation to implement the recommendations. 370  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 379": "10.9  Royal commissions\nRoyal Commissions of Inquiry , commonly referred to as royal commissions, are inquiries \nappointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the government. Traditionally , the term \u2018royal\u2019 is used when the body has been established under the authority of a Governor or Governor-General. These inquiries are temporary , and are made by a body appointed by the government to provide advice on, or to investigate, a particular issue. These inquiries are usually open to the public and seek input from the community . The reports of royal commissions are tabled in parliament.\nRoyal commissions may be called by:\n\u2022 the Commonwealth government;\u2022 the State government; or\u2022 the Commonwealth government and State government.\nThe Commonwealth government has the power to establish a royal commission under \nthe Royal Commissions Act 1902 (Cth). The Victorian government can establish a royal commission under the Inquiries Act 2014 (Vic).\nRole\nA royal commission can be established for a number of reasons. It may be established to draw upon expert opinion about the approach that should be adopted by the government on an issue. In many instances, the issues considered may relate to a controversial issue that the government has been unable, or unwilling, to resolve.\nIn political terms, a royal commission may be used by a government to shift the decision-\nmaking responsibility in controversial areas from the government to another body , to avoid public criticism. At times, this creates a signifi  cant delay in the decision-making process. Royal commissions can also perform an educative function: they allow various views to be published and the reasons for government action to be known to the community .\nProcess\nA royal commission is established when the Governor-General or Governor issues \u2018Letters \nPatent\u2019. Letters Patent are issued under the Public Seal of State. The Letters Patent will state who will form part of the royal commission, who will chair the royal commission and the terms of reference. The terms of reference may also set the time by which the royal commission is to report.\nRoyal commissions have specifi  c powers of investigation. They include wide-ranging \ncoercive powers of investigation, such as the ability to summons and cross-examine witnesses, and to obtain evidence. Royal commissions can also apply for warrants to search and to seize evidence.\nA royal commission has extensive powers to conduct hearings. These hearings are \nusually formal in nature and involve interviewing witnesses and taking evidence. A royal commission is not bound by the same rules of procedure and evidence as a courtroom.

A royal commission can inquire into any area of Australian life: for instance, the Inquiry into certain Australian companies in relation to the UN Oil-For-Food-Program 2005\u201306. They can also be called in the wake of natural disasters and accidents, such as after Victoria\u2019s 2009 \u2018Black Saturday\u2019 bushfi  res.\nCommonwealth royal commissions are conducted under the Royal Commissions Act \n1902 (Cth). This Act has been amended more than 20 times since its enactment. The last amendment was in 2013, and allowed for private sessions to be conducted by the Child Sexual Abuse Royal Commission.\nRoyal commissions do have a number of benefi  ts and a number of disadvantages. \nHere are some:\nPros\n\u2022 They are the highest form of inquiry on matters of public importance.\n\u2022 They have unique and coercive powers of investigation, including the power to \nsummon witnesses to give evidence under oath or to produce documents.\n\u2022 They have many powers under the Act, extending beyond those available to \nordinary courts.\n\u2022 Royal commissions can be established at any time and have a single purpose.\u2022 Royal commission reports are tabled in parliament and, generally , are made public. \nThe 1916 Royal Commission into the administration of the Northern Territory \nwas tabled in parliament. However, the parliament did not order that the report be\u00a0printed. \n\u2022 Royal commissions are not passive \u2013 they make recommendations of a non-binding \nnature relating to the issue under inquiry .\n\u2022 Royal commissions can seek expert advice from a range of sources.\n\u2022 Royal commissions serve an important democratic function.

  "Page 383": "  Legal brief 10.2 \nRoyal Commission into Family Violence\nThe issue\nA number of high-pro/f_i  le family violence incidents, \nincluding the murder of schoolboy Luke Batty at the hands of his father, became the catalyst for a royal commission into domestic violence in Victoria.\nAction\nThe State government established a royal commission, appointing Justice Marcia Neave AO as commissioner.\nIt investigated the entire family violence support system \nand justice system from the ground up. This included government and non-government organisations, courts, prosecutors, police, corrections and child protection. The focus was on preventing family violence, increasing early intervention, improving victim support, making perpetrators accountable and helping agencies coordinate their responses better. According to the terms of reference, family violence made up a third of all police work in the State and cost the economy more than $3 billion every year.\nThe Commission received over 1000 written \nsubmissions, and worked for 13 months, hearing evidence from more than 200 family violence stakeholders, experts and victims. Survivors told harrowing stories. A total of 44 group consultations were conducted. Approximately 850 people participated in those consultation sessions. The Commission received informal expert brie/f_i  ngs and conducted site visits.\nOutcome\nThe Commission\u2019s /f_i  ndings were tabled in parliament in March 2016. It made a total of 227 recommendations. The /f_i  nal report was published as seven volumes, a total of more than 1900 pages. Recommendations included:\n \u00b7Emphasising breaking down a siloed system to increase transparency and cooperation between sectors. Numerous recommendations aimed at holding the performance of sectors working with family violence cases to account. Transparency and accountability of the system, including police responses, were highlighted.\n \u00b7Removing the burden from victims in getting help and placing accountability on the shoulders of perpetrators was a strong focus of the report. There is also a role for the State government in lobbying the Federal government for change.\n \u00b7The right of perpetrators to experience privacy through the court system should not override the right of victims to be safe.The recommendations were broken down into sections: risk management and assessment, information sharing, specialist family violence services, children and young people, sexual assault, pathways to services, police, court-based responses, offences and sentencing, perpetrators, the role of the health system, family violence and diversity, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, older people, people from culturally diverse communities, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex communities, people with disabilities, male victims, women in prison, women working in the sex industry, prevention, the workplace, sustainable governance data, research and evaluation, investment, and industry planning.\nGovernment action\nThe government accepted all the recommendations and pledged $572 million to combat domestic violence over 10 years, to ensure that successive governments would be forced to act and implement change. The government also created the portfolio of the Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence. The minister is responsible for implementing the recommendations.\nSome reforms were immediately initiated after the \nreport.\nThe government promised reforms would be \nintroduced to parliament to strengthen intervention orders, tighten up the bail process and allow better information sharing between police and other agencies to ensure that perpetrators\u2019 privacy is not protected ahead of keeping women and children safe.\nThe Family Violence Reform Implementation Monitor \nAct 2016 (Vic) was introduced. This Act establishes an independent monitoring authority to report on the implementation of the Commission\u2019s recommendations and the government\u2019s family violence action plan.\nThe recommendations affected the National Domestic \nViolence Order Scheme Bill 2016 (Cth) (a/uni00A0national scheme for domestic violence orders) and the Corrections Legislation Amendment Bill 2016 (Vic), which ensures that prisoners who are unlawfully released from prison can be returned to custody by police of/f_i  cers. They also broaden and clarify the grounds for information sharing about offenders \u2013 for the purposes of the working with children scheme \u2013 with corrections and parole authorities nationally and overseas.\nOne major recommendation was to establish a secure \ncentral information point. This would store information from the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice databases so that perpetrators can be tracked.

  "Page 385": "Role\nParliamentary committees can investigate:\n\u2022 specifi  c matters of policy\n\u2022 government administration or performance.\nCommittees are designed to provide parliament with advice on issues. They can draw \non expertise from outside parliament and assess community views. Committees are able to conduct inquiries to fi  nd out the facts of a case or issue, gathering evidence from expert groups or individuals. They make recommendations in a fi  nal report. The use of committees provides for a broad range of views to be represented.\nProcess\nCommittees have considerable powers. These powers may include the power to order people to attend by summons to give evidence and to produce documents. Committee proceedings are considered \u2018proceedings in parliament\u2019, which means they are \u2018privileged\u2019: members and witnesses cannot be sued or prosecuted for anything they say during a committee hearing. These powers ensure that committees are able to get a\u00a0comprehensive view of an issue.\nTerms of reference set out the purpose of each committee inquiry . Depending on \nthe type of committee, the terms of reference may be set by the house, by a minister, by\u00a0statute, or by the committee itself.\nThe committee will advertise its terms of reference in the media and on the internet \nso that it can receive evidence and submissions from interested parties. Stakeholders or people with particular expertise or interest may be directly approached to make a submission.\nLegal advisers and research offi  cers are employed by parliament to work with \ncommittees. They often produce a discussion paper. The research offi  cers will also analyse evidence in submissions and evidence presented at public hearings.\nAs well as running public hearings, seminars, public meetings, focus groups and \nroundtable discussions, committees may also inspect facilities or visit places relevant to the inquiry . Hearings are generally open to the public, but in special circumstances evidence may be heard in private. Hansard provides a transcript of evidence taken at public hearings. Evidence taken in private is not disclosed or published.\nAfter examining all the evidence, the committee will prepare a report setting out \nits conclusions and making recommendations. This report is presented to the house that initiated the inquiry , or to both houses in the case of a joint committee. Sometimes some members of a committee do not agree with all recommendations in the report. If a member of the committee does not agree with the majority of the committee, they may publish a minority or dissenting report.\nThe government will respond to the committee report by presenting a statement in \nparliament. In this statement the government may accept all (or some) of the committee\u2019s recommendations, and announce its intention to take certain actions. Generally , the government is required to respond within 6 months. Often the recommendations lead to changes in the law .\nIn recent times, committees have increasingly used social media to seek \ncommunity participation in the inquiry process. The Commonwealth parliament publicises inquiries and committee activities through the \u2018About the House\u2019 Twitter and Facebook accounts.Parliamentary \ncommittees can be asked to investigate particular/uni00A0issues.\nThe scope of a parliamentary committee inquiry is set out in its terms of reference.\nParliamentary committees can have public hearings, seminars, public meetings, focus groups, roundtable discussions, publish interim reports and conduct site visits.\nThe committee will \nprepare a report which is presented to parliament; the government generally has 6 months to respond to the report.

  "Page 386": "  Legal brief 10.3 \nEnd of life choices \u2013 A parliamentary committee inquiry\nThe issue\nThe need for laws to allow citizens to make informed \ndecisions regarding the end of their life. Victoria\u2019s laws regarding providing assistance to die are inconsistent, and there is no legal framework surrounding how decisions are made. Despite signi/f_i  cant examples of death taking place in the shadows of the law, prosecutions are rare and the penalties applied are generally so light as to risk undermining the law. Between 2009 and 2013, 240 people experiencing debilitating physical decline took their own lives. Most were over the age of 65.\nShortcomings of the law\nThe committee considered the shortcomings of the State\u2019s laws. In the case of DPP v Rolfe [2008] VSC 528, Justice Cummins said to Bernard Rolfe, after Rolfe pleaded guilty to manslaughter and received a 2-year suspended sentence, \u2018your actions do not warrant denunciation; you should not be punished; there is no need to deter you from future offences\u2019. Mr Rolfe was 81 years old, and he and his wife had made a suicide pact, because she was going to be placed in an aged care facility and they did not want to be separated. They attempted joint suicide by gassing themselves, but only she died. Mr Rolfe was found to have been suffering severe psychiatric stress and depression at the time.\nWhile some argue that people\u2019s needs can be \naddressed with appropriate palliative care and mental health services, the Coroner said that even so, \u2018people who have invariably lived a long, loving life surrounded by family die in circumstances of fear and isolation\u2019 and that \u2018The only assistance that could be offered is to meet their wishes, not to prolong their life.\u2019 As former Supreme Court Judge John Coldrey said:\nthese cases don\u2019t sit comfortably in a court setting. The person goes out into society labelled a murderer when their motive has been compassion and love \u2026 I\u2019d like to see a regime where people who act in this way are not put at risk of criminal charges.\nTimeline\nOn 7 May 2015 Victoria\u2019s Legislative Council agreed that the Legal and Social Issues Committee inquire into, consider and report on the need for laws to allow citizens to make informed decisions regarding their own end of life choices, no later than 31 May 2016. The /f_i  nal report was tabled on 9 June 2016.\nTerms of reference\nThe terms of reference were:\n\u00b7assess the practices currently being utilised within the\nmedical community to assist a person to exercise theirpreferences for the way they want to manage theirend of life, including the role of palliative care;\n\u00b7review the current framework of legislation, proposedlegislation and other relevant reports and materials inother Australian States and Territories and overseasjurisdictions; and\u00b7consider what type of legislative change may berequired, including an examination of any Federal lawsthat may impact on such legislation.\nDespite the terms of reference not mentioning the words \u2018assisted dying\u2019, almost all submissions either supported or opposed the legalisation of voluntary euthanasia or physician-assisted dying.\nSubmissions and hearings\nThe committee received 1037 submissions, 925 from individuals in a private capacity, and 112 from organisations. The organisations included the Anglican Diocese of Melbourne, the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, the Australian College of Nursing, the Australian Medical Association (Victoria), various Dying with Dignity groups, the Eastern Palliative Care Association, the Ethics Committee of the Christian Medical and Dental Fellowship of Australia, the Law Institute of Victoria, the Commissioner for Senior Victorians, Palliative Care Australia, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, the Presbyterian Church of Victoria, and the Rationalist Society of Australia.\nThe overwhelming majority of individual submissions \ndiscussed assisted dying. Only a small number focused solely on palliative care.\nThe committee conducted an extensive program of site \nvisits and public hearings around Victoria between July 2015 and February 2016. The committee held 17 days of public hearings and heard from 154 witnesses.\nThe committee also travelled to the Netherlands, \nSwitzerland, the Canadian province of Qu\u00e9bec, Canada and Oregon, US to speak to stakeholders about their jurisdiction\u2019s/uni00A0 assisted dying framework. Each of these jurisdictions has a legal framework permitting assisted/uni00A0dying.\nKey \ufb01  ndings\nThe committee found that death is considered a taboo subject, and so is not talked about, which inhibits planning for end of life care, and may result in a person\u2019s end of life wishes not being followed. Other /f_i  ndings were:\n\u00b7Although most people in Victoria wish to die at home,\nin reality most of them will die in hospital.\n\u00b7Demand for palliative care is steadily increasing, and isexpected to continue to do so. At the same time, palliativecar\ne patients\u2019 diseases and needs have increased in\ncomplexity. Victoria\u2019s palliative care sector is overburdenedand needs better support from government.\n\u00b7Despite Victoria having good palliative care servicesavailable, those who could bene/f_i  \nt the most often\nreceive care too late.\n\u00b7Carers and the volunteer workforce are integral toVictoria\u2019s palliative care/uni00A0system.\n\u00b7Although the advance care planning process has pr oven\nbene/f_i  ts, there are low awareness and implementationrates for advance care plans in Victoria and Australia.\n\u00b7Existing end of life care legislation is confusing inmany ways, and causes uncertainty, particularly forhealth practitioners.\u00b7The legal framework for advance care planningspans several Acts and some legal issues may relyon common law rulings. Substitute decision-makingprovisions are confusing and poorly understoodby doctors. In addition, the law does not pr\novide\ncertainty that a person\u2019s wishes, even when they aredetailed in an advance care plan, will be carried outwhen they lose capacity.\n\u00b7Prohibition of assisted dying is causing some peoplegreat pain and suffering. It is also leading some toend their lives prematurely and in distressing ways.\n\u00b7Instances of assisted dying are rare, even in jurisdictionswher\ne it is legal. Assistance in dying is, in the vast\nmajority of cases, provided to people in what wouldotherwise be the /f_i  nal weeks of their lives.\n\u00b7Government support and funding of palliative carehas not declined when assisted dying frameworkshave been introduced.\n\u00b7Courts invariably impose lenient penalties without jailtime on people who assist a loved one to end theirlife. This is true in Australia and in similar overseasjurisdictions.\n\u00b7Everyone\u2019\ns end of life care needs differ. It is important\nthat Victoria has a system in place to cater for theneeds of individuals, whilst ensuring that there aresafeguards in place to protect vulnerable people.\nRecommendations\nThere were 49 recommendations. Twenty-nine recommendations related to palliative care and 18 recommendations related to advance care planning and the need for statutory recognition of advance care directives.\nThe major recommendation was to legislate to allow \nassisted dying in certain circumstances:\nRecommendation 49: The Government should introduce legislation to allow adults with decision making capacity, suffering from a serious and incurable condition who are at the end of life to be provided assistance to die in certain circumstances.\nThis recommendation includes safeguards:\n\u00b7Eligibility: A mentally competent adult experiencing\nintolerable and unrelievable suffering, with weeks ormonths to live. Must be ordinarily resident in Victoriaand an Australian citizen or permanent resident.\n\u00b7A process by which requests may be made (andrescinded).\n\u00b7Checks and tests to ensure that relevant criteria havebeen met.\n\u00b7Establishment of an authority to receive reports ofassisted dying and present reports to parliament.\n\u00b7Conscientious objection (to not participate) isprotected.\n\u00b7In cases where a patient cannot self-administer lethalmedication, a doctor may do so at the patient\u2019srequest.Government response\nThe government said that the implementation of the Victorian End of Life and Palliative Care Framework, and the Medical Treatment Planning and Decisions Act 2016 (Vic), address a signi/f_i  cant number of the recommendations made by the committee.\nThe government supported 44 of the \nrecommendations,/uni00A0 identi/f_i  ed three recommendations (numbers 28, 29 and 49) requiring further work, and did/uni00A0not support two (numbers 27 and 43).\nRecommendations 28 and 29 concern legislative \nprovisions for the doctrine of \u2018double effect\u2019 and the withholding and withdrawing of futile treatment. The legal doctrine of \u2018double effect\u2019 justi/f_i  es giving pain relief treatment, provided it is given with the main intention to relieve pain \u2013 it excuses any unavoidable, but unwanted, life-shortening effect of giving that treatment.\nThe government agreed to prepare a Bill to legalise \nvoluntary assisted dying, consistent with the committee\u2019s proposed assisted dying framework. Expert legal advice and a Ministerial Advisory Panel (MAP), providing advice on the practical and clinical implications of the Bill, will support the preparation of the Bill.\nThe MAP will work with key stakeholders on the \ndevelopment and implementation of an assisted dying framework, and to provide perspectives on the access, safeguards, and practical considerations that are needed.\nRecommendation 27 requires that all cases of \ncontinuous palliative sedation are reported to, and published by, the Department of Health and Human Services. The government did not support this because testimony from clinicians quoted in the report did not reveal any concern about the use of sedation to manage symptoms. The term \u2018continuous palliative sedation\u2019 has various de/f_i  nitions, so it was also not clear how it would be reported.\nOne of the key /f_i  ndings of the committee was that \nVictoria\u2019s medical treatment laws were overly complex and needed to be simpli/f_i  ed.\nThe committee also recommended the introduction \nof legislation to recognise advance care directives: the Medical Treatment Planning and Decisions Act 2016 \n(Vic) \nwas the government\u2019s response to this. This Act does not require registration of advance care directives or a central registry, but is designed to consolidate existing laws. It makes key changes around practices that allow people to make decisions about their medical treatment, as medical practice today already accommodates a range of decision-making processes. The Act also recognises the importance of supported decision-making to help a person make their own decisions for as long as they are able.\nVoluntary assisted dying\nThe Bill to legalise voluntary assisted dying will be put to a conscience vote in the second half of 2017.\nSources: Inquiry Into End of Life Choices \n\u2013 Final Report, press reports and Hansard transcripts 378  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law Chapter 10  Reforming the/uni00A0law 379\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

Mr Rolfe was found to have been suffering severe psychiatric stress and depression at the time.\nWhile some argue that people\u2019s needs can be \naddressed with appropriate palliative care and mental health services, the Coroner said that even so, \u2018people who have invariably lived a long, loving life surrounded by family die in circumstances of fear and isolation\u2019 and that \u2018The only assistance that could be offered is to meet their wishes, not to prolong their life.\u2019 As former Supreme Court Judge John Coldrey said:\nthese cases don\u2019t sit comfortably in a court setting. The person goes out into society labelled a murderer when their motive has been compassion and love \u2026 I\u2019d like to see a regime where people who act in this way are not put at risk of criminal charges.\nTimeline\nOn 7 May 2015 Victoria\u2019s Legislative Council agreed that the Legal and Social Issues Committee inquire into, consider and report on the need for laws to allow citizens to make informed decisions regarding their own end of life choices, no later than 31 May 2016. The /f_i  nal report was tabled on 9 June 2016.\nTerms of reference\nThe terms of reference were:\n\u00b7assess the practices currently being utilised within the\nmedical community to assist a person to exercise theirpreferences for the way they want to manage theirend of life, including the role of palliative care;\n\u00b7review the current framework of legislation, proposedlegislation and other relevant reports and materials inother Australian States and Territories and overseasjurisdictions; and\u00b7consider what type of legislative change may berequired, including an examination of any Federal lawsthat may impact on such legislation.\nDespite the terms of reference not mentioning the words \u2018assisted dying\u2019, almost all submissions either supported or opposed the legalisation of voluntary euthanasia or physician-assisted dying.\nSubmissions and hearings\nThe committee received 1037 submissions, 925 from individuals in a private capacity, and 112 from organisations. The organisations included the Anglican Diocese of Melbourne, the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, the Australian College of Nursing, the Australian Medical Association (Victoria), various Dying with Dignity groups, the Eastern Palliative Care Association, the Ethics Committee of the Christian Medical and Dental Fellowship of Australia, the Law Institute of Victoria, the Commissioner for Senior Victorians, Palliative Care Australia, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, the Presbyterian Church of Victoria, and the Rationalist Society of Australia.\nThe overwhelming majority of individual submissions \ndiscussed assisted dying. Only a small number focused solely on palliative care.\nThe committee conducted an extensive program of site \nvisits and public hearings around Victoria between July 2015 and February 2016. The committee held 17 days of public hearings and heard from 154 witnesses.\nThe committee also travelled to the Netherlands, \nSwitzerland, the Canadian province of Qu\u00e9bec, Canada and Oregon, US to speak to stakeholders about their jurisdiction\u2019s/uni00A0 assisted dying framework. Each of these jurisdictions has a legal framework permitting assisted/uni00A0dying.\nKey \ufb01  ndings\nThe committee found that death is considered a taboo subject, and so is not talked about, which inhibits planning for end of life care, and may result in a person\u2019s end of life wishes not being followed. Other /f_i  ndings were:\n\u00b7Although most people in Victoria wish to die at home,\nin reality most of them will die in hospital.\n\u00b7Demand for palliative care is steadily increasing, and isexpected to continue to do so. At the same time, palliativecar\ne patients\u2019 diseases and needs have increased in\ncomplexity. Victoria\u2019s palliative care sector is overburdenedand needs better support from government.\n\u00b7Despite Victoria having good palliative care servicesavailable, those who could bene/f_i  \nt the most often\nreceive care too late.\n\u00b7Carers and the volunteer workforce are integral toVictoria\u2019s palliative care/uni00A0system.\n\u00b7Although the advance care planning process has pr oven\nbene/f_i  ts, there are low awareness and implementationrates for advance care plans in Victoria and Australia.\n\u00b7Existing end of life care legislation is confusing inmany ways, and causes uncertainty, particularly forhealth practitioners.\u00b7The legal framework for advance care planningspans several Acts and some legal issues may relyon common law rulings. Substitute decision-makingprovisions are confusing and poorly understoodby doctors. In addition, the law does not pr\novide\ncertainty that a person\u2019s wishes, even when they aredetailed in an advance care plan, will be carried outwhen they lose capacity.\n\u00b7Prohibition of assisted dying is causing some peoplegreat pain and suffering. It is also leading some toend their lives prematurely and in distressing ways.\n\u00b7Instances of assisted dying are rare, even in jurisdictionswher\ne it is legal. Assistance in dying is, in the vast\nmajority of cases, provided to people in what wouldotherwise be the /f_i  nal weeks of their lives.\n\u00b7Government support and funding of palliative carehas not declined when assisted dying frameworkshave been introduced.\n\u00b7Courts invariably impose lenient penalties without jailtime on people who assist a loved one to end theirlife. This is true in Australia and in similar overseasjurisdictions.\n\u00b7Everyone\u2019\ns end of life care needs differ. It is important\nthat Victoria has a system in place to cater for theneeds of individuals, whilst ensuring that there aresafeguards in place to protect vulnerable people.\nRecommendations\nThere were 49 recommendations. Twenty-nine recommendations related to palliative care and 18 recommendations related to advance care planning and the need for statutory recognition of advance care directives.\nThe major recommendation was to legislate to allow \nassisted dying in certain circumstances:\nRecommendation 49: The Government should introduce legislation to allow adults with decision making capacity, suffering from a serious and incurable condition who are at the end of life to be provided assistance to die in certain circumstances.\nThis recommendation includes safeguards:\n\u00b7Eligibility: A mentally competent adult experiencing\nintolerable and unrelievable suffering, with weeks ormonths to live. Must be ordinarily resident in Victoriaand an Australian citizen or permanent resident.\n\u00b7A process by which requests may be made (andrescinded).\n\u00b7Checks and tests to ensure that relevant criteria havebeen met.\n\u00b7Establishment of an authority to receive reports ofassisted dying and present reports to parliament.\n\u00b7Conscientious objection (to not participate) isprotected.\n\u00b7In cases where a patient cannot self-administer lethalmedication, a doctor may do so at the patient\u2019srequest.Government response\nThe government said that the implementation of the Victorian End of Life and Palliative Care Framework, and the Medical Treatment Planning and Decisions Act 2016 (Vic), address a signi/f_i  cant number of the recommendations made by the committee.\nThe government supported 44 of the \nrecommendations,/uni00A0 identi/f_i  ed three recommendations (numbers 28, 29 and 49) requiring further work, and did/uni00A0not support two (numbers 27 and 43).\nRecommendations 28 and 29 concern legislative \nprovisions for the doctrine of \u2018double effect\u2019 and the withholding and withdrawing of futile treatment. The legal doctrine of \u2018double effect\u2019 justi/f_i  es giving pain relief treatment, provided it is given with the main intention to relieve pain \u2013 it excuses any unavoidable, but unwanted, life-shortening effect of giving that treatment.\nThe government agreed to prepare a Bill to legalise \nvoluntary assisted dying, consistent with the committee\u2019s proposed assisted dying framework. Expert legal advice and a Ministerial Advisory Panel (MAP), providing advice on the practical and clinical implications of the Bill, will support the preparation of the Bill.\nThe MAP will work with key stakeholders on the \ndevelopment and implementation of an assisted dying framework, and to provide perspectives on the access, safeguards, and practical considerations that are needed.\nRecommendation 27 requires that all cases of \ncontinuous palliative sedation are reported to, and published by, the Department of Health and Human Services. The government did not support this because testimony from clinicians quoted in the report did not reveal any concern about the use of sedation to manage symptoms. The term \u2018continuous palliative sedation\u2019 has various de/f_i  nitions, so it was also not clear how it would be reported.\nOne of the key /f_i  ndings of the committee was that \nVictoria\u2019s medical treatment laws were overly complex and needed to be simpli/f_i  ed.\nThe committee also recommended the introduction \nof legislation to recognise advance care directives: the Medical Treatment Planning and Decisions Act 2016 \n(Vic) \nwas the government\u2019s response to this. This Act does not require registration of advance care directives or a central registry, but is designed to consolidate existing laws. It makes key changes around practices that allow people to make decisions about their medical treatment, as medical practice today already accommodates a range of decision-making processes. The Act also recognises the importance of supported decision-making to help a person make their own decisions for as long as they are able.\nVoluntary assisted dying\nThe Bill to legalise voluntary assisted dying will be put to a conscience vote in the second half of 2017.\nSources: Inquiry Into End of Life Choices \n\u2013 Final Report, press reports and Hansard transcripts 378  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law Chapter 10  Reforming the/uni00A0law 379\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

The committees promote public debate on the proposed changes, and allow community groups or individuals to have their say on issues being considered by parliament. This ensures that the laws made represent the views of the community.\nA parliamentary committee is made up of both \ngovernment and opposition members of parliament. Committees investigate and examine speci/f_i  c issues, gather evidence from experts, community groups or individuals, and then report to the parliament. With the support of parliamentary sta\ufb00  , each committee focuses on a de/f_i  ned area and builds up expertise and specialised/uni00A0knowledge.\nCommittees represent a signi/f_i  cant strength of the \nparliamentary process for changing the law because they undertake extended investigations that cannot be performed in the parliament during the legislative process.\nCommittees contribute signi/f_i  cantly to the functions \nof government. They allow for better policy-making. The work of committees enables members of parliament to be better informed on issues. This improves their contribution to policy and legislative review. Committees generate discussion of issues across party lines. Finally, inquiries can increase public awareness of the work of parliament.\nThe Senate as a \u2018house of review\u2019\nThe importance of the role of committees in the review of/uni00A0legislation is well illustrated by the processes adopted in/uni00A0the Senate.\nSenate committees\nThe Scrutiny of Bills Committee examines each Bill that comes before the Senate to ensure that legislation does not impinge unduly on the fundamental rights and liberties of citizens. When the committee identi/f_i  es a potential problem with a Bill, it alerts the Senate and the responsible minister. After considering the minister\u2019s response, the committee reports back to the Senate. Based on the issues raised by the committee, individual senators may propose amendments to the Bill. These amendments may be dealt with in the Committee of the Whole stage.\nThe role of the Senate as a \u2018house of review\u2019 is also \nevident in the work of its legislative and general purpose standing committees. The Selection of Bills Committee considers all Bills (except appropriation Bills) before the Senate and decides which Bills should be referred to a Senate committee for further consideration and which Bills should be debated by the Senate in the usual way. If Bills are complex, controversial or contentious they are usually referred to Senate committees. This will often happen before the second reading.\nIf a Bill is referred to a Senate committee, that \ncommittee will examine the Bill in detail. The committee may call for submissions and witnesses from interested bodies or government departments to give evidence. Through this process, previously unforeseen problems may be identi/f_i  ed or misunderstandings about the impact of the Bill resolved. After its investigations, the committee reports back to the Senate. The report may contain recommendations for amendments or changes to/uni00A0 the Bill. Of course, other amendments may be put forward by the Senate during the Committee of the Whole stage.\nApproximately 20% of Bills have been referred to \nstanding committees using this process. This process prevents time being wasted on lengthy debate and ensures that all Bills are examined in detail. In theory, this process should result in better quality legislation.\nThis system gives senators the opportunity to have a \nthorough look at the legislation. Committees can hear submissions from groups and individuals interested in the/uni00A0legislation. The public has the opportunity to contribute to the legislative process.\nIt is important to note, however, that even after a Bill \nhas been referred to a Senate committee and returned to the Senate for debate, it may still be considered by the/uni00A0Committee of the Whole. 380  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

  "Page 394": "11.1   The role of parliament and \ncourts in law reform\nAlthough a signi\ufb01  cant feature of the law is that it is stable and predictable, the law is not \nrigid and \ufb01  xed. The law is a re\ufb02  ection of the society in which it operates. The law must be able to evolve and change to meet the changing needs of society . There is always a need for changes to the law \u2013 to examine the law , to revise it and to keep it relevant to the changes that take place in our community .\nReform in the law can come about through court decisions and by parliament passing \nlegislation. Parliament is the supreme law-making body . Therefore it is appropriate that most changes in the law are as a result of legislation. However, it is important to recognise that the courts have a complementary role in law-making. Courts can make laws through the operation of the doctrine of precedent and through statutory interpretation.\n11.2  Parliament as a law-maker\nAs stated earlier, the main purpose of parliament is to make laws. If a statute law and common law con\ufb02  ict, statute law will prevail. Parliament has many strengths as a democratic law-making body .\nStrengths\nThe primary role of parliament is to make laws. Parliament can make laws to remedy \nexisting problems or in anticipation of future problems (in futuro). Parliament can also respond to the need to change the law by repealing or amending a law . Alternatively , parliament can undertake substantial reform of the law . Provided that parliament is operating within its constitutional limits, it can make, amend or repeal law .\nResources for law-making\nParliament is an elected and representative body . It has the resources and expertise necessary for the drafting of legislation. Ministers may call on the specialist knowledge of members of their departments to advise on the content of proposed laws and on the need to change the law . Parliament can form committees, working parties and special bodies to assess the need for change and make recommendations for change. As parliament has access to expert information, it is able to keep up with changes in society and monitor the need for reform in the law .Provided that the \nparliament is making laws within its constitutional limits, it has the ultimate power to make, amend or repeal law.\nParliament has the resources and expertise to change the law. 386  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 395": "Democratically elected\nParliament is democratically elected. This process aims to ensure that legislation re\ufb02  ects \nthe will of the majority of people and the changing needs of society . Governments that ignore the community\u2019s wishes to change unpopular laws may suffer the consequences at election time.\nParliament can adjourn debates to allow for further time to consider the views of the \ncommunity . Parliament can also refer a Bill to a parliamentary committee for more detailed consideration.\nThe government may sometimes delay passing a Bill to allow time for public reaction \nand debate. Individuals and groups can seek to in\ufb02  uence change in the law by directly approaching members of parliament or through petitions, demonstrations or the media. Members of parliament are responsible and answerable to the people. As noted above, if\u00a0voters are dissatis\ufb01  ed with the laws that they make, there can be an electoral backlash.\nComprehensive law reform\nParliament is capable of undertaking comprehensive law reform. It may legislate to cover entire areas of public policy . It may establish moral obligations. Alternatively , legislation may act to support community attitudes, such as when the Victorian parliament acted to restrict smoking within 4 metres of school entrances.\nProvides for debate\nThe legislative process has many stages. These stages allow members to be informed \nabout proposed changes and to express their views. The use of parliamentary committees allows for a detailed review of complex or controversial legislation. The debates of parliament are broadcast, streamed online and published in Hansard. In theory , members of the public can follow the parliamentary debates; they can certainly express their concerns to their local member. This means that the laws passed by parliament have been fully considered and represent the views of the community .\nDelegation of power\nParliament may authorise subordinate bodies (such as local councils, government departments and statutory authorities) to make what is called \u2018delegated legislation\u2019 by passing an enabling Act. This aims to allow law-making to be more \ufb02  exible and ef\ufb01  cient. By delegating authority , parliament allows law-making to be directly responsive to local needs or specialist demands. For instance, local councils can make laws to meet speci\ufb01  c needs in their local area. Statutory authorities are bodies established by an Act of Parliament. The Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority (VCAA) is a statutory authority . VCAA has been given the power to set rules for the conduct of assessments including examinations.\nWeaknesses\nAlthough parliament has signi\ufb01  cant strengths as a law-making body , there are also some limitations on parliament\u2019s ability to respond to the need for changes to the law .\nDelays in law-making\nAlthough parliament can change the law at any time, in order to do that parliament must \nbe meeting. These times are known as sittings. Parliament does not sit every day of the year. Generally , parliaments tend to sit 40\u201370 days a year. During non-sitting periods, members of parliament work on committees and/or in their electorates.\nFederal system\nIn a federal system, there may be some confusion about the division of law-making responsibilities between the Federal and State levels of government. This division of powers may result in a failure to legislate to cover a community need, or in the passing of\u00a0con\ufb02  icting legislation.Parliament is \ndemocratically elected to/uni00A0represent the will of the/uni00A0majority.\nParliament can undertake large-scale reform of entire areas of law.\nThe legislative process ensures that views about proposed changes in the law are re/f_l  ected in parliamentary debates.\nParliament can delegate law-making powers.\nParliament can only change the law when it is/uni00A0sitting.\nThe division of powers may/uni00A0result in confusion and inconsistencies.

  "Page 396": "In some instances, both the Commonwealth and a State parliament need to pass laws \nto effectively regulate an issue. For example, the regulation of gun ownership requires \ncooperation between States and Territories and the Commonwealth government: the Commonwealth parliament can make laws about the importation of guns, but the ownership, possession and use of \ufb01  rearms is regulated by State laws.\nImpact of party politics\nMembers of parliament are elected to represent the interests of the people in their electorate. However, most members of parliament are also members of a political party . Political parties can exercise strong discipline over their members of parliament. Members of parliament are expected to vote according to their party\u2019s policy .\nParty politics also impact on the function of the upper house. Although the upper house \nis intended to represent the interests of regions or States, it also acts as a house of review . A hostile upper house can frustrate the government\u2019s legislative agenda. This can occur when the government, which of course has a majority in the lower house, does not also have a majority in the upper house. Alternatively , if the government does have a majority in the upper house, the upper house may become a \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 and automatically approve government Bills.\nImpact of political pressures\nThe legislative process is dominated by the government, through the Cabinet, as it is \nCabinet\u2019s legislative proposals that generally make up the majority of the parliament\u2019s law-making work. The government, through Cabinet, may be reluctant to take a stand \u2013 propose legislation \u2013 in relation to issues where there is no dominant community view (there may be several equally strongly held views), or where its own party policy is considered to be different from the dominant community view . These electoral pressures mean that some issues are not dealt with at all in parliament.\nDelegating law-making power\nParliament has adopted the practice of delegating legislative power for the sake of administrative ef\ufb01  ciency . However, it often fails to adequately supervise delegated legislation, and has created a vast range of subordinate authorities that act with the authority of parliament. This lessens the extent to which parliament can be said to be the prime source of law .\nSlow to change\nThere are many stages in making a new law . The process of investigating and passing a \nnew law can be time-consuming.

  "Page 397": "11.3  Courts as law-makers\nThe main role of the courts is to resolve disputes. Precedent develops as judges reach \ndecisions in the disputes they hear in court, and laws are made as a result. In this sense, law-making is a by-product of the dispute resolution procedures used by courts.\nA court has to administer the law , but courts also have the power to interpret statutes. \nWhen dealing with precedent, the courts will usually just modify the existing principles. When there is a con\ufb02  ict between judge-made law and statute law , statute law will prevail.\nStrengths\nCourts can change a law quickly\nThe primary role of the courts is to settle disputes. In the process of resolving a dispute, \ncourts can provide an immediate response to what the law should be in relation to a particular case.\nIn applying the law day-to-day , the courts determine how the law is applied.\nThis means that justice can be achieved in individual cases by interpreting the law as it \nrelates to the facts of that case. Courts can distinguish, reverse or overrule decisions, and \nthis can result in a change in precedent.\nFlexibility\nThrough the application of precedent, courts provide considerable \ufb02  exibility for the law \nto adapt to the changing needs of society . For example, the ratio decidendi of Donoghue v Stevenson has been extended to apply to a variety of situations involving negligence. By\u00a0distinguishing past cases or reversing or overruling past decisions, a court can change an\u00a0established legal principle.\nIndependent of the political process\nCourts are not subject to political pressures. They need only consider the submissions put forward by counsel acting on behalf of the parties. Courts may consider the changed values in our society; however, there is far less pressure on them than on members of parliament to do so. The judiciary is independent. Although judges are not elected, they are in an informed position to determine the law . Each party to a dispute has a responsibility to prepare and present their own case to the judge, and each will research and debate the need for change or for a new interpretation in order to win their case. Judges can maintain or change the law as required, without the fear of an electoral backlash.\nConsistency and fairness\nThe courts provide consistent application of precedent and interpretation of legislation. \nThe application of the doctrine of precedent ensures that cases relating to similar legal issues are decided in a predictable manner. This is a fundamental aspect of fairness.\nPredictability\nParties can reasonably predict how the law will apply by looking at previous decisions of the courts in similar cases.\nAccess to change\nAny individual has the right to take a case to court, provided they have standing. This \nmeans that they need to be able to show the court that they are directly affected by the issues. Therefore, in theory , we all have the opportunity in matters that directly affect us to\u00a0take a case that may change the law to court.\nCourts can identify needs for reform\nJudges deal with the day-to-day application of the law and can identify areas of the law that are in need of reform. Judicial decisions are free from outside pressure and therefore judges can, if an appropriate case comes before the court, deal with controversial issues without the fear of electoral backlash. In making a decision, a judge may highlight the need for parliament to change the law .A court can change a law \nquickly if a relevant case is brought before it.\nCourts can also interpret \nthe meaning of words in statutes to overcome injustices.\nBy distinguishing past cases or reversing or overruling past decisions, a court may change an established legal principle.\nJudges can maintain or change the law as required, without the fear of an electoral backlash.\nCourts provide consistent application of precedent and interpretation of legislation.\nIn theory, we all have the opportunity in matters that directly affect us to take a case that may change the law to court.\nJudicial decisions are free from outside pressure.

  "Page 398": "Efficiency of operation\nThe doctrine of precedent provides judges and the legal profession with principles of law . \nConsequently , courts and lawyers can refer to previous cases in reaching their decisions. The system ensures that judges are protected from professional criticism, as their decisions have been made while taking earlier precedents into account.\nWeaknesses\nThe role of the courts in reforming the law has a number of weaknesses. These include the following.\nA case must come before the courts\nCourts must wait until a legal action is brought before them. Even then, the law-making power of the courts is restricted by the nature of the dispute: that is, whether there is any existing common law or legislation in the area. Therefore, the ability of the courts to respond to the need for changes to the law may be slow and spasmodic.\nThe decision in a case only directly affects the parties\nJudge-made law cannot have the same wide-reaching effect as laws made by parliament because the decision in a case directly affects only the parties to the case. However, the reason for the decision in a case can act as an important in\ufb02  uence on people considering a similar action.\nTime-consuming process\nA decision by a court about what the law should be is not always reached quickly . Courts \ncannot reach a decision before they hear all the arguments put by both parties. In complex cases, this can take a considerable amount of time. A \ufb01  nal determination as to what the law should be may not be reached until after a case has been heard on appeal. This may take years.\nRigidity\nThe doctrine of precedent binds courts to decisions made in superior courts. Unless a \ncourt is considering a new or novel situation, it must apply the existing precedent. A court may be bound by precedent, whether or not the judge agrees with the outcome of the application of those principles. The doctrine of precedent implies not only consistency , but also some rigidity . However, parliament can override a precedent established by the courts. When a precedent becomes out of date, for example, parliament can make a law to change it.\nUndemocratic\nCourts are not representative of the community , because they are appointed: they are not elected. This means that members of the community do not know what the values and attitudes of judges are. Judges are independent of parliament and government, and are not directly answerable to the electorate. Only in very rare circumstances will a judge be removed from of\ufb01  ce.\nRetrospective\nThe primary role of courts is to settle disputes. Courts decide a case \u2018after the event\u2019. \nThey\u00a0are always acting retrospectively; that is, they look at an existing problem and decide how this problem can be overcome. In law , this is known as acting ex post facto, or \u2018after the fact\u2019. As the individual parties to a civil dispute bear the costs of the action, this is a costly way for individuals to \ufb01  nd out what the law should be.Courts must wait until a \nlegal action is brought before them.\nJudge-made law does not have the same wide-reaching effect as laws made by parliament.\nA /f_i  nal determination as to what the law should be may not be reached until after a case has been heard on appeal. This may take years.\nA court may be bound by precedent, whether or not the judge agrees with the outcome of the application of those principles.\nCourts are not democratically elected or representative law-making/uni00A0bodies.\nCourts act retrospectively \u2013 after a dispute has occurred. 390  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",
  "Page 399": "Precedent may be slow to change\nThe development of the law is dependent on a case being taken to court. The more \nconservative judges may be reluctant to change the law by departing from the \nprecedents, whether or not the precedent is generally considered to be outdated. Even\u00a0where a new precedent is created it only applies to a limited set of circumstances (as all precedents do), and it may take many years for a whole area of law to develop. An\u00a0excellent example of where the courts continued to be bound to an outmoded and unjust precedent was the law relating to the Widow\u2019s discount (see Chapter 9).\nCostly\nThe high cost of preparing a court case may prevent individuals from seeking to change \nthe law by taking a case to court. If an individual seeking to bring about a change in the law through the courts loses, they risk paying not only their own costs but the costs of the defendant and of the court.\nLack of certainty\nPrecedent is based on previous court decisions with facts that are similar, but there may still be uncertainty for litigants, as no two cases are exactly the same. The court may decide that there are suf\ufb01  cient differences to distinguish the present case from earlier cases. Also, a precedent may be overruled, disapproved or reversed. It is often necessary to examine a number of cases to determine precisely the legal principle that is applicable; this may lead to further uncertainty , as the outcome of each case may vary slightly , resulting in some con\ufb02  ict within the law .\nCourts do not have the resources to research the need \nfor change\nCourts can only focus on issues presented by parties to a dispute, and must rely on the \ninformation presented to them in court. They cannot comprehensively research and review the need for law reform. Courts make rulings on the legal issues relevant to the case before them. They cannot seek public opinion, form committees or refer matters to law reform bodies before making a decision.Conservative judges may \nbe reluctant to depart from precedents even when they are outdated.\nIndividuals may be reluctant to seek to in/f_l  uence a change in the law by taking a case to court because of the costs.\nPrecedent is not a concise statement of law, but is based on previous court decisions where the facts of a case are similar. This may result in uncertainty, as no two cases are exactly the same.\nCourts cannot comprehensively research and review the need for law reform in the same way as parliament.

Explain.\nNEWSREPORT  11.1 \nCourts do make law\nCOURTS DO MAKE LAW. SOME MAY ARGUE THAT  \ncourts simply declare what the law is: in other words, when the law is unclear, the courts hear legal arguments and apply strict legal logic to resolve the dispute, and declare what the law is. These people believe that any change in the law should be left to the/uni00A0elected parliament. However, it is now widely accepted that in resolving disputes, judges exercise a wide range of choices and are making laws, not merely declaring legal principles. In doing so, judges are subject to many constraints. They are accountable in ways that are di\ufb00  erent from the ways an elected parliament is/uni00A0accountable.\nInterpretation and change\nThrough the process of statutory interpretation, the courts tell us what parliament meant in Acts. When a judge is faced with circumstances in a case that were not anticipated by parliament, the judge is clearly making law when deciding upon a particular interpretation of the legislation. Bishop Hoadly, in 1717, said, \u2018whosoever hath the power to interpret the law hath the power to make it\u2019 . Should parliament be dissatis/f_i  ed with the meanings construed by the courts, it can pass legislation to change the interpretation.\nCommon law and change\nHowever, it is in the /f_i  eld of common law that the law-making role of the courts is highlighted. The common law has evolved from thousands of decisions over hundreds of years. It forms a body of law much larger than all the statutes passed by Australian parliaments. Common law covers areas as diverse as contract, negligence and nuisance \u2013 and it has been made by unelected judges for almost 1000 years.\nWhen a judge decides that an established principle of \nlaw applies to a particular set of facts, and a court has not considered that question in the past, the judge is making law. The decision made by the judge adds to the body of the law to be used and applied in future cases.\nThe High Court and change\nSometimes higher courts, particularly the High Court, go further than making incremental changes to existing legal principles. The High Court can overrule previous understandings of the common law and establish new principles. Even in this area, the power of the courts to make law is subject to constraints: parliament can pass laws to change common law principles.\nThe common law develops in a sequential and systematic \nmanner. It is formed by the application of existing rules to a series of fact situations, with existing principles being adapted to new situations. It changes and adapts gradually over time. Comprehensive, wholesale change to an area of law is left to parliament. Courts do not have the facilities, techniques or procedures to undertake comprehensive review of the need for change in entire areas of law.\nHowever, there are numerous cases where the High \nCourt has \u2018modernised\u2019 the common law, such as abolishing the marital exemption to rape and recognising Native Title in the Mabo case.\nIn the Mabo case the High Court decided that the \ncommon-law principle of terra nullius was no longer law.  392  Cambridge Making and Breaking the Law\nISBN 978-1-316-64754-7 \nPhotocopying is restricted under law and this material must not be transferred to another party.\n\u00a9 Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) 2018\nCambridge University Press",

This decision exempli/f_i  es an important constraint on courts in law-making. The Mabo case was decided in relation to a speci/f_i  c set of circumstances. Although the court formulated a principle to resolve that dispute, it did not provide a comprehensive code for the regulation of Native Title disputes. It was parliament that introduced legislation to codify Native Title law, for the broader recognition of Native Title in future cases and to establish a dispute resolution/uni00A0process.\nNovel cases and change\nThe operation of the doctrine of precedent provides for continuity and consistency in the application of law to new circumstances. However, it is when a novel situation arises that the law-making role of the courts is most evident and controversial. In the case of Cattanach v Melchior [2003] 215 CLR 1, the High Court considered whether damages could be recovered by parents for the cost of raising a healthy child born after a failed sterilisation procedure. The case was based on a claim that the surgeon who performed the sterilisation had been negligent. The court decided that the parents could claim damages. The case was decided by a majority of four to three. The majority judgment declared that the principles of negligence applied and that the recovery of economic loss was therefore also recognised by the law. The case resulted in considerable public comment and criticism. Critics argued that it was not consistent with community values to allow parents to recover damages for the costs of raising a healthy child.Should courts change the law?\nWhat should a court do when faced with a choice between maintaining an existing legal principle and establishing a new rule? Many would argue that the courts have an obligation to maintain the status quo.\nThis approach places value on the certainty and \nstability inherent in the doctrine of precedent as well as on the need for substantial change in the law to take into account community views. However, others argue that it is appropriate for the courts to take a more active role in changing the law given that parliament can take action to change it if necessary.\nParliaments have acted to impose limitations on the \ncommon law. They have replaced common law rights with statutory schemes for compensation, set caps on the award of damages and established exclusions.\nBoth parliament and the courts are accountable for their \nlaw-making, but in di\ufb00  erent ways. Parliament is accountable through the electoral process. Courts are also accountable: they are open to the public and publish reasons for their decisions. This means that our courts are open to scrutiny and criticism. Professor Michael Coper suggests that parliament and the courts are partners in law-making:\nalthough their respective roles can bring them into \ncon/f_l  ict. In particular, they act as a brake on each other, the court interpreting and even invalidating the legislation of parliament, and the parliament modifying and even abolishing parts of the common law when it /f_i  nds the court to have been too bold or not bold/uni00A0enough.

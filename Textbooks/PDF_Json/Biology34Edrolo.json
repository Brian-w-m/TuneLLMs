Phospholipids have a\n phosphate head\n and two \nfatty acid tails\n.\n \nThe phosphate head and fatty acid tails are chemically very different from each other. \nThe phosphate head is:\n\u2022\n \nmade of a glycerol and phosphate group\n\u2022\n \nnegatively charged, making it \nhydrophilic \n(\u2018water-loving\u2019) and \npolar\n. \nThe two fatty acid tails are:\n\u2022\n \nmade of long chains of carbon and hydrogen \n\u2022\n \nuncharged,\n hydrophobic \n(\u2018water-fearing\u2019), and \nnonpolar\n.\nThese chemical differences mean that the phosphate heads are attracted to, and oriented \ntowards, the aqueous intra- and extracellular environments. The fatty acid tails orient \nthemselves away from the intra- and extracellular fluid to form the middle portion of the \nbilayer (Figure 3). \nBecause phospholipids have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts, they are \namphipathic\n molecules.

In the nose, an odour molecule dissolves \nin the nasal mucous that surrounds olfactory receptors. These receptors are embedded in the plasma membrane of nasal \ntissue that sits behind each nostril. The receptors consist of chains of amino acids anchored in the plasma cell membrane that \ntransverse it seven times (see image). Stimulating a receptor leads to changes in the cell, which in turn leads to the generation \nof a neural signal to the brain.\nEach receptor can detect several related scents that pass through nasal mucus, and each scent can typically activate several \nolfactory receptors. Scientists think humans have around 400 different scent receptors, and depending on the combination of \nreceptors stimulated, this can lead to the detection of more than one trillion unique odours.\nphospholipid\nbilayer\nextracellular\nintracellular\ncytoplasm\nextracellular \ufb02uid\nT\npolar\nnonpolar\npolar\nW\nX\nY\ncell membrane\nnucleus\ncytoplasm\nZ\nR\nS\nU\nV\nImage: Kallayanee Naloka/shutterstock.com\nQuestion\n \n3\n \nAccording to the case study, the correct pathway for scent detection is\nA\n \nodour molecules dissolve in nasal mucous \n\uf067\n olfactory receptor stimulated \n\uf067\n neural signal generated \n\uf067\n brain\n \nrecognises scent\nB\n \nbrain recognises scent \n\uf067\n olfactory receptor stimulated \n\uf067\n neural signal generated\nQuestion\n \n4\n \nWhat is meant by the term \u2018olfactory receptor\u2019 in this case study?\nA\n \nthe nose \nB\n \na cell that detects scents\nC\n \na transmembrane protein that detects scents\nExam\u2013style questions \nWithin lesson\nQuestion\n \n5\n \n(4 MARKS)\nConsider the diagram of a plasma membrane.\na\n \nIdentify and outline the functions of molecules\n \nQ, R, S,and T.\u2002\n(2 MARKS)\nb\n \nIdentify the chemical nature of Molecule Q.\u2002\n(1 MARK)\nc\n \nScientists describe the plasma membrane as \u2018fluid mosaic\u2019.

How did you feel \nabout this? Happy that you got to miss a bit of class? Or did you have to blink back tears of anxiety? \nHPV can cause genital warts and a number of cervical and anal cancers. The HPV vaccine is taken in \ntwo doses six months apart and became free for school students in 2007 as part of the National HPV \nVaccination Program.

You can use KSSs \nin all realms of life, however, and not just in the Biology exam. This is because, at its most \nfundamental level, science is about discovering the truth in the world around us \u2013 which is \nclearly something we should all be doing! \nYou demonstrate KSSs when you ask questions like:\n\u2022 do I believe this? Why?\n\u2022 what evidence supports this conclusion? \n\u2022 is this evidence trustworthy?\n\u2022 is it weak or strong evidence?\n\u2022 is there evidence that undermines this conclusion, or supports another position?\nWhen your friend gossips to you about their neighbour, or your grandad complains that \n\u2018kids these days are spoilt\u2019, or you read a tweet from your favourite celebrity \u2013 you can ask \nthese questions to decide for yourself what to think.\nYou will use KSSs more rigorously and methodically in your VCE science subjects. In these \nclasses, you will learn to distinguish between weak (e.g. an opinion ) and strong (e.g. data \nfrom a well-designed controlled experiment ) evidence. You will also collect, analyse, and \ndraw conclusions by:\n\u2022 designing your own investigation/s, or\n\u2022 examining someone else\u2019s investigation/s. \nLess formal evidence, such as anecdotes and expert opinions, can be helpful to consider \nwhen drawing conclusions. However, data gathered from investigations that are guided by \nKSSs are broadly considered more \u2018trustworthy\u2019 and reliable . This is because KSSs help you \nto reduce bias , minimise the effects of errors , and ensure results are not due to chance. \nThe rest of this lesson will walk you through the KSSs you can use to design and  \nexamine scientific investigations. Whilst there are many different types of scientific \ninvestigations, we\u2019ll mostly focus on controlled experiments, which allow scientists to \nmanipulate specific variables and control their studies to a high degree.

They might notice that a particular plant has useful properties, \nstudents perform poorly on tests when hungry, or that birds fly around the MCG lights  \nat 11 pm. Then, scientists need to narrow the scope of their inquiry down to one question  \nthat they wish to answer.

For example, \nIndigenous Australians have a much longer history of developing knowledge which is often focused on \nthe interconnections between individuals, habitats, and ecosystems. An example of this holistic, or \u2018big \npicture\u2019 knowledge of Indigenous Australians is fire management. According to Koori Country Firesticks \n(2017), Aboriginal fire management removes ground vegetation using cool burns that move slowly over \nsmall areas, taking place up to several times a year. This:\n\u2022 reduces the fuel load\n\u2022 protects the canopy of trees (so fruits and seeds are preserved; insects, birds, and climbing mammals \nhave a place to hide; and shade is maintained after the fire)\n\u2022 doesn\u2019t burn hollow logs (maintaining habitat)\n\u2022 moves slowly so animals can escape\n\u2022 manages weeds\n\u2022 results in quicker return of native plants to the area. \nFurthermore, the practice allows easier access to Country , cleans up important pathways, maintains \ncultural responsibility, and is part of ceremonies. In contrast, European \u2018hazard reduction burns\u2019 tend to \ninvolve hotter and less frequent fires that have the single goal of reducing fuel load. \nMany people are calling for the integration of KSSs and Indigenous knowledge. These people point out that \nIndigenous ways of knowing share many characteristics with KSSs. Both place importance on observation, \nquestioning, hypothesis  testing, experimentation, and application. Indigenous ways of knowing have \nscientific rigour through thousands of years of repetition, but can also change if new evidence arises. \nThese methods of scientific inquiry enabled Australia\u2019s first peoples to thrive on this continent for many \ntens of thousands of years, in good health and in a sustainable way. \nWant to learn more about the intersection between Indigenous knowledge and KSSs?

  "Page 16": "Sometimes you need to do a bit more background research to settle on a final research \nquestion. You may even go through a few draft questions as you refine it to become more \ntestable, achievable, and specific. From the research question, it is usually pretty easy to \ndevelop an aim . The aim is the objective of the investigation and typically starts with the \nword \u2018To\u2019. For the research questions above, the aims would be:\n\u2022 to determine if the salinity of water affects the duration of life cycle stages in \ndeveloping sea monkeys\n\u2022 to determine if fasting before tests affects student performance\n\u2022 to determine if silver gull ( Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae ) nighttime behaviour is \ndifferent in light-polluted Melbourne compared to non-light-polluted areas.\nNote that, where required, we include scientific names for species in research questions \nand aims.aim\u2002 the objective of an \ninvestigation or experiment\nImage: fishmonger/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 1\u2002 Indigenous knowledge has \nmade significant contributions to \nscience, including the identification \nof potential new materials from \nnative plants like spinifex grasses.\nHOW POWERFUL IS A POWER NAP?\nIf you\u2019re studying VCE Biology, you\u2019re probably quite keen to investigate if there is something you can do \nto improve your results on assessments. You might have lots of friends who swear by the \u2018cram\u2019 method \nbefore exams, where they try to fit as much information in their head in the minutes, hours, and days prior. \nYour mum, meanwhile, always tells you that \u2018if you have a problem, sleep on it\u2019 and that this will help you \nunderstand and solve it. Is there anything to either of these two learning strategies? Can either of them \nimprove your memory and performance on tests?\nConsidering this, we devised a first version of a research question to investigate:\n\u2018Is cramming or napping a better study method?\u2019\nWe realised pretty quickly that this research question has some problems:\n\u2022 It\u2019s not testable \u2013 how do you measure if something is a \u2018better\u2019 study method?\n\u2022 It\u2019s not specific \u2013 who is participating? What does cramming look like? How long do participants nap for?\nFrom here, we worked on a second draft of a research question:\n\u2018Do Year 11 Biology students at this school remember more if they cram or nap for one hour after a class?\u2019\nThis question was much more testable, given that a test can be administered to measure how much our \nresearch participants actually remember. It was also much more specific, given that the people being \nstudied are identified as Year 11 Biology students from a certain school. We\u2019ve also made the research \nquestion more achievable by making the duration of the experiment one hour and using easily accessible \nparticipants (rather than, for example, all VCE students in Victoria).\nUsing this information, devise an aim for the investigation:\nAim: _________________________________________________________________________________________\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\nSuggested answer\nAim: To determine if cramming or napping improves the \nmemory of Year 11 Biology students at this school.\nIdentify independent, dependent, and controlled variables\nNotice that creating a testable, achievable, and specific research question means that \ninvestigations tend to end up measuring the effect of one variable on another variable.  \nThe variable that is being affected is the dependent variable (DV) , while the variable that \nis being manipulated is the independent variable (IV) . We can identify the IVs and DVs in \nthe research questions we looked at previously:\n\u2022 DV \u2013 duration of life cycle stages; IV \u2013 water salinity\n\u2022 DV \u2013 test score; IV \u2013 time spent fasting prior to test\n\u2022 DV \u2013 seagull nighttime behaviour; IV \u2013 light pollution or no light pollution.\nA controlled variable  (also known as a constant variable) is a factor that remains the same \nthroughout the experiment in an effort to reduce the chance of this factor influencing the \nDV . To identify variables you need to control in your investigation, consider other factors \nthat might cause your DV to change. For example, when testing the effect of activity \nlevel (IV) on occurrence of heart disease (DV), you would want to make sure that each \nparticipant was of a similar age.

If it is not controlled for (by only including people of a similar age in the experiment) it will serve as an \nuncontrolled variable, making it difficult to determine if exercise alone has an impact on heart disease.\nFormulate a hypothesis\nFrom your aim, question, and variables, you can then build a hypothesis. A hypothesis is \nmore than \u2018what you expect to happen\u2019 during your experiment.

These rules also help ensure that your experiment is: \n\u2022 repeatable  \u2013 you can repeat your experiment and get the same results over and  \nover again\n\u2022 reproducible  \u2013 other scientists could follow your method and get the same results over \nand over again\n\u2022 valid  \u2013 your experiment actually measures what it claims to be measuring.\nIf your experiment is not repeatable, reproducible, or valid, then the results are typically \nnot going to be useful, reliable, or meaningful. To ensure you can trust your results, \nyou need to design a strong method. Here are some tips for ensuring your methods are \nrepeatable, reproducible, and valid:\nIdentify your experimental group/s and control group/s\nThe experimental group  has individuals exposed to your IV treatment or intervention. \nThere may be different levels of your experimental group. For instance, if you are testing \nthe effect of a new pesticide on crop yield, your experimental groups could be three groups \nof crops exposed to either low, medium, or high levels of pesticide. \nControl groups  are used as a comparison with experimental groups and every controlled \nexperiment should include at least one control group. Control groups can be samples that \nare not exposed to any level of the IV , which means we do not expect it to produce any \nresults. These are known as negative controls. Alternatively, controls can be groups where \nyou would expect to see a result. Scientists apply a treatment to this group which induces a \nwell-understood effect on the DV which can be compared against the effects of other IVs. \nThese are known as positive controls.\nNegative controls are the most common and should be present in all controlled \nexperiments. If they do produce results, we know that something other than the IV (an \nuncontrolled variable) may be causing the change in the DV and our method is flawed. \nIn our pesticide and crop yield experiment, a negative control group would be a field not \nexposed to the pesticide at all, while a positive control group would be a field exposed to \nan already-existing pesticide that is known to be effective at protecting crops from pests. repeatable\u2002 an experiment/\nmeasurement in which scientists, \nusing the methods they designed, \ncan obtain the same result  \nmultiple times \nreproducible\u2002 an experiment/\nmeasurement in which a group \nof scientists, using methods \ndesigned by others, can obtain the \nsame results as another group\u2019s \nexperiment\nvalid\u2002 a measurement or \nexperiment that actually tests \nwhat it claims to be testing\nexperimental group\u2002 a group \nof individuals/samples in which \nthe independent variable is \nmanipulated.

Placebos \nare medicines/procedures that seem identical to the treatment medicine/procedure, but have no active \ningredients and do not result in therapeutic benefit. This means that the participants do not know if they \nare part of the treatment group or the placebo group. So, if a treatment involves giving participants a pill, \nthe placebo group would be given a pill that looks like the drug, but has no active ingredients (e.g. a sugar \npill). A standard negative control, meanwhile, would just be a group of participants who receive no pill (so \nthey know they aren\u2019t receiving treatment). \nIn such studies, we often note an improvement in patients treated with the placebo. This improvement is \nknown as the \u2018placebo effect\u2019 and is due to the psychological beliefs of the person (i.e. if you believe you \nare going to get better, you will probably get better). Scientists have even figured out how to boost the \nplacebo effect to make a medicine more effective.

Instead, data is \nmanipulated so that the main result, pattern, or trend is obvious. Tables are not always the \nbest way to show trends, so results sections will typically include graphs and charts.\nThe type of graph you choose depends on the type of data that you have collected.

Conclusions may also be drawn from anecdotes  or opinions, though \nthese are not considered reliable sources of evidence as they are subject to no or low \nreplicability and large amounts of bias.\nDrawing conclusions from evidence isn\u2019t always easy.

Furthermore, even if your data indicate that your IV \nis related to your DV in a consistent and measurable manner (e.g. if you increase the IV , the \nDV increases), this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the IV causes the change in DV . In other \nwords, correlation of two variables does not mean that one causes the other.\nData may not follow the same trend outside of the range you measure\nIn Figure 23, scientists measured the height of a seedling for ten days.

  "Page 47": "Theory  details\nWhat is ethics and why is it important?\nEthics  is a field of knowledge that deals with our personal understanding of right and \nwrong. At its simplest, ethics can be thought of as a working system of moral principles \nthat help us question our actions and those of others while defending our own values, \nbeliefs, and principles.\nApplied ethics  is important in helping us bridge the gap between abstract theories we \nmight learn in the classroom and concrete situations we might face in the world. It is an \nattempt to implement ethical theories and moral principles to guide decision making in \nparticular contexts and problems. The ethical situations we are faced with often arise \nwhen different stakeholders (e.g. scientists, organisations) have different opinions on what \nis right or wrong and must choose between alternative points of view when deciding how \nto act. \nWhy is ethics important in biology?\nScience is rarely an individual endeavour. Instead, it involves constant interactions with \nothers, whether that be colleagues, employers, or the public. An important part of \u2018doing \nscience\u2019 is not just the theories and concepts you learn, but also how you apply that \nknowledge in a way that maximises ethical outcomes. This requires scientists to engage \nin metathinking  \u2013 that is, thinking about the way they think \u2013 to ensure that they are \naware of the outcomes of their actions and employ different strategies for reaching \nimportant decisions. \nIt may be easy to assume that this ability to think critically and act ethically becomes \npart of a scientist\u2019s \u2018toolkit\u2019 incidentally through natural means such as their upbringing, \neducation, and community involvement. However, this \u2018incidental learning\u2019 is not enough. \nInstead, ethics is deeply embedded and integrated within scientific education, and \ninvolves active learning and practice on the part of the developing scientist. Scientists \nuse these ethical frameworks they learn to help guide their decision\u2013making process and \njustify their actions. As such, the application of ethical understanding is an important \nfeature that runs throughout the entirety of the VCE Biology course. \nWhat is a bioethical issue? \nBiologists frequently use bioethics  in their work across interdisciplinary fields, including \nbiotechnology, environmental conservation, and healthcare research. In the course of this \nwork, biologists are often confronted with bioethical issue s, which are specific ethical \ndilemmas pertaining to biology (Figure 1). \nBioethical issue\nDeciding between\nalternative\nchoices or \ncourses of actionIn\ufb02uenced by\nexternal factors \u2013\nsocial, economic,\nlegal etc. Con\ufb02icting\nopinions/values/\nideals from di\ufb00erent\nstakeholders\nFigure 1\u2002 Some of the common features of a bioethical issue\nWe can recognise a bioethical issue because it will typically involve a decision\u2013making \nprocess between two or more options for action, each of which will require some form  \nof ethical justification \u2013 \u2018I should do X in this scenario, as it means that Y will occur\u2019.  \nThe options available in these scenarios are usually in conflict with one another and can be \nevaluated using different  approaches to bioethics  and ethical concepts .

In the world of science and medicine, patents are useful in \nprotecting the innovation of manufacturers by assigning them legal ownership of their developments,  \nsuch as vaccines and medical equipment. \nNonetheless, it is unclear whether patents stimulate and promote important research and development, \nor whether they hinder it. Manufacturers argue that the protection of a patent provides an incentive to \ninvest time and resources into further development, and allows for increased financial returns to improve \nresourcing and help progress further research. On the other hand, some critics argue that patents stifle \nfree research by preventing others from accessing patented equipment or methods that might be helpful \nin their studies. This can lead to skyrocketing costs for the general public, as pharmaceutical companies \nmight decide to heavily inflate the cost of their own prescription medications. \nApproaches to bioethics \u20020.0.0.15\nOverview\nThere are many different approaches that can be used when exploring bioethical issues.  \nIn VCE Biology, you are required to use three approaches in particular: consequences\u2013\nbased, duty/rule\u2013based, and virtues\u2013based. These approaches act as frameworks for \naddressing bioethical concerns and serve many purposes, including identification, \nexploration, consideration, decision\u2013making, and reflection. \nTheory  details\nWhat is an approach to bioethics?\nBecause bioethics is often \u2018applied\u2019, scientists need specific tools to help them make \ninformed ethical decisions. One type of tool scientists can use are approaches to bioethics, \nwhich are decision\u2013making frameworks that help guide ethical behaviour. There are three \nspecific approaches to bioethics that you need to be aware of in VCE Biology (Figure 2). \nDepending on the bioethical issue being considered, you may be able to use one or more of \nthe following approaches to help inform your decision\u2013making process.\n1B THEORY 37\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

It can be helpful to use key \u2018buzz\u2019 terms when discussing each \napproach, as this demonstrates to your examiner that you can effectively separate the approaches in your mind and \ndiscuss their individual focuses.\nCORONAVIRUS 2020 \u2013 THE APPROACHES IN ACTION \nTo consider these approaches in action, let us examine a bioethical issue during the early parts of the \ncoronavirus pandemic, where Italian hospitals were faced with the ethical decision of who to treat and who \nto turn away. In such a situation, different ethical approaches may point to different courses of action. \nAs of March 1 2020, Italy had a total number of 1 701 cases of coronavirus nationwide. However, within the \nspace of only 30 days, the number had sky\u2013rocketed to 110 574 cases. This dramatic increase meant that \nhospitals and doctors could not treat everyone, leaving them with an incredibly hard decision: \u2018who do we \ntreat first and how do we decide who to turn away?\u2019\nThe ethical ramifications of such a decision were immense, as people who were denied treatment were \nsometimes at an increased risk of dying. Denying patients\u2019 access to treatment seems to stand in direct \nopposition to \u2018professional ethics\u2019 and therefore requires ethically trained professionals to try and develop \nthe most moral course of action in the extraordinary circumstances. \nAs such, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) \npublished guidelines that doctors and nurses were asked to follow. The guidelines were rigorously \nexamined against a range of bioethical considerations, including a consequences\u2013based approach, which \nsought to maximise favourable outcomes for the largest number of people. This involved allocating care \nto patients with the highest chance of survival, specifically prioritizing young and otherwise healthy \nindividuals while turning away older patients. How else might the SIAARTI have acted, and how might \neach approach point to a different course of action? \ncont\u2019dconsequences\u2013based approach\u2002  \nan approach to bioethics that  \naims to maximise positive \noutcomes while minimising \nnegative outcomes\nduty\u2013 and/ or  \nrule\u2013based approach\u2002  \nan approach to bioethics that \npromotes the responsibility of  \nthe agent above all else,  \nand places importance on the duty \nof each individual\nvirtues\u2013based approach\u2002  \nan approach to bioethics that \nemphasises the individual \ngoodness of the agent, and \npromotes acting in accordance \nwith the values of a \u2018moral\u2019 person, \nsuch as honesty and compassion CHApTER  1: G EnERA l Skill S 38\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",
  "Page 50": "Why are approaches to bioethics important? \nThe three approaches we have looked at serve as broad frameworks for considering a \nbioethical issue and help guide us when considering the potential of different outcomes. \nFigure 5 represents some of the ways a bioethical approach might be useful when \nconsidering a bioethical issue. Ultimately, each approach can serve a range of important \nfunctions, and they provide the individual with useful guidelines when approaching a \nparticular dilemma or issue.\nApproach X1\n2\n345Identifying the issue\nWhy is this an important bioethical concern? \nWhy are we considering this?1\nExploring the issue in context\nWhat situational factors surround the issue?\nWhat do we need to be aware of?2\nConsidering di\ufb00erent perspectives\nWho are the stakeholders involved in this issue? \nWhat do they think and how might this a\ufb00ect them?3\nDeciding on a position or course of action\nWhat is the most ethical way to proceed?\nWhat position am I going to take on this issue?4\nRe\ufb02ecting on chosen course of action\nHow did my position or course of action a\ufb00ect stakeholders? \nWhat was the impact of my judgement?\nDo I need to revise my position?5\nFigure 5\u2002 The role of a bioethical approach \u2013 identification, exploration, consideration, decision\u2013making, and \nreflection.

If it \nturned out, as was the case \nfor most Italian hospitals, that \nthe demand for care \noutweighed their resources,\nthen maximising good \noutcomes might mean \nfocusing those resources on \npatients who are likely to best \nrecover and respond to \ntreatment. In this case, that \nmeans focusing treatment on \nyoung and otherwise healthy \nindividuals, and less so on \nolder patients who are\nperhaps less likely to survive.  A duty/rule-based approach \nmight argue that as doctors \nand healthcare providers, \neach individual has a moral \nobligation to provide \ntreatment to whoever is in \nneed. Perhaps this would \nmean focusing resources in a \n\ufb01rst-come-\ufb01rst-serve manner,\nwhere care is distributed \nsequentially based on when a \npatient arrives at the hospital. \nA duty/rule-based approach\nmight suggest that this is the \nfairest means of distributing \ncare, and that hospitals have \na duty to act indiscriminately \nrather than turning away \npatients based on their age. A virtues-based approach \nmight argue that doctors \nought to follow the moral \nguidance of their own value \njudgements as to who is most \nin need. That is, the \ndistribution of care should be \nleft to the moral virtues of a \ngood doctor \u2013 such as \nkindness, fairness, and good \njudgement. In this case, a \nhospital would not\nfollow a certain rule (such as\n\ufb01rst-come-\ufb01rst-serve), nor \nfocus on maximising \nconsequences (though this \nmay well be an outcome). \nInstead, each doctor is seen \nas their own moral agent\ndeciding how best to \ndistribute resources. \nFigure 3\u2002 The approaches in action \nIn this case, the recommendations of the SIAARTI and the response of Italian hospitals most closely \naligned with a consequences\u2013based approach. However, it is important to understand that the three \napproaches rarely act in isolation. That is, it is rare for the approaches to sit distinctly in their own box. \nInstead, each approach will often act in conjunction with others to inform an individual as to the best or \nmost ethical course of action in the circumstances. It is helpful to think of \nbioethical approaches \nas tools in a toolbox. \nSometimes, a single hammer \nwill be enough for a job, \nsuch as hammering a nail. \nOther times, however, the job \nmight be more complex and \nrequire not only a hammer \nbut also a saw and a wrench. \nThe same is true of the three \napproaches.

  "Page 51": "Ethical concepts \u20020.0.0.16 \nOverview\nThere are five ethical concepts that are often used in conjunction with the three overarching \napproaches to bioethics. These concepts \u2013 integrity, justice, beneficence, non\u2013maleficence, \nand respect \u2013 help inform the approaches spoken about in the previous section. \nTheory  details\nWhat are ethical concepts and why are they important? \nAs well as the three overarching approaches to bioethics, there are also a variety of ethical \nconcepts which may be used in the exploration of bioethical issues. Each concept serves \nas a unique perspective or lens for considering different angles of an ethical dilemma \nand may be used either in isolation or in conjunction with each other alongside the three \napproaches we spoke about in the previous section. \nThere are five specific bioethical concepts that you need to be aware of in VCE Biology. \nDepending on the bioethical issue being considered, you may use one or more of the \nfollowing concepts to help you analyse a bioethical issue: \n\u2022  Integrity  \u2013 the commitment to knowledge. This concept encourages individuals \nto act honestly and truthfully, especially when presenting their findings or results. \nIntegrity prioritises an accurate understanding and representation of the facts, whether \nfavourable or unfavourable to an individual\u2019s personal position, and encourages \nscrutiny and criticism. \n\u2022  Justice  \u2013 the commitment to fairness. This concept encourages consideration \nof different people\u2019s opinions and positions, especially those directly affected or \nmarginalised by a course of action. Justice prioritises the fair distribution of resources, \nas well as equal access to the benefits of an action, policy, investigation,  \nor research.\n\u2022  Beneficence  \u2013 the commitment to maximising benefits. This concept encourages \nindividuals to act in a way that benefits others. Beneficence promotes the personal \nwellbeing and good of other persons, particularly direct stakeholders such as patients \nand research subjects. \n\u2022  Non\u2013maleficence  \u2013 the commitment to minimising harm. This concept encourages \nindividuals to act in ways that remove as much harm as possible. Indeed, while actions may \nalways involve some degree of possible harm, non\u2013maleficence prioritises minimising \nthis harm, sometimes to the detriment of people\u2019s freedom of choice and autonomy. \n\u2022  Respect  \u2013 the commitment to consideration. This concept encourages individuals to \nconsider the value of others, including their personal welfare, beliefs, freedom, and \nautonomy. Respect prioritises the freedom of others to make their own decisions and be \nprotected from persecution or exploitation. \nThe concepts in action \nHere at Edrolo Lab, our team is developing a new vaccine that can help cure a terrible  \nnew disease known as \u2018Biologitis\u2019. Throughout our research and trial stages, we were sure \nto act ethically and were informed at different times by the three approaches to bioethics. \nNow, it is time to release our vaccine and make it available to the public.

This can be really helpful for patients and families to better understand a disease that runs in their \nfamily, and for doctors to prescribe treatments. However, before we can check someone\u2019s DNA, we must first obtain a sample, \nwhich can be taken either before or after birth.\nPrenatal screening (testing during pregnancy) involves taking a small sample of foetal cells from the amniotic fluid or \ntissue surrounding the foetus and identifying any potential abnormalities before a child is born. This early identification can \nallow families to learn about and plan for genetic diseases, which can significantly improve outcomes for patients. Without \ntreatment, many of these genetic diseases can reduce the quality of life, or even threaten the life of both the foetus and the \nmother.

A double-blind study means that neither the participants nor the \nresearchers know which participants are receiving the placebo, and which participants are receiving the treatment. \nThese studies are designed to compare the results of the introduced treatment with that of a placebo on two groups of \nrandomly selected patients. \nIn the field of psychiatric drug development \u2013 also known as psychopharmacological drug development \u2013 placebo studies \npose a significant problem in that they often result in negative findings. These are trials in which researchers have \nfailed to demonstrate the superiority of the treatment over the placebo condition, and therefore pose a range of issues \nsurrounding the validity of clinical drug development trials. The larger the placebo response, the more difficult it is to \nprove that an experimental treatment is effective. \n1 Define the term placebo. \u2002(1 MARK) \n2 Describe what is meant by the term \u2018placebo problem\u2019 and explain how this can be problematic for \npsychopharmacological drug developers. \u2002(2 MARKS)\n3 Negative trials are often less likely to be published in academic journals. With reference to the bioethical  \nconcept of integrity, explain the potential impact of this on the understanding of certain psychiatric treatments  \nor medications. \u2002(2 MARKS)\nAntidepressants and the placebo effect \nAntidepressants are a group of medications that are prescribed to help manage symptoms of depression, anxiety, \nand a range of other related psychiatric illnesses. They work in a variety of ways, and typically increase active levels of \nserotonin in a patient\u2019s brain. However, Kirsch (2019) of Harvard Medical School suggests that an extensive literature \nreview of the clinical trial data shows that most of the benefits of antidepressants in the treatment of depression and \nanxiety are due to the placebo response. What\u2019s more, Kirsch (2019) suggests that any differences in improvement \nbetween drug and placebo are not clinically meaningful and may often be due to research errors on the part of both the \npatients and clinicians.\nIn efforts to refute Kirsch\u2019s findings, two groups of researchers designed separate research trials each aimed at  \ntesting the efficacy of a specific antidepressant (Drug X) on relieving symptoms of depression. Each of the methods  \nare described. \nGroup 1 \n\u2022 Potential participants were first phone-screened by an in-house clinical psychologist and given a score from \n1\u201310 based on the severity of their symptoms. A score above 7 indicates a diagnosis of clinical depression and \ngains admittance to the trial. \n\u2022 A total of 30 participants were admitted and randomised to two study arms: one group was given sugar pills \nwhile the other was given Drug X. Both groups were instructed to take two pills a day for 12 weeks (morning \nand night). Each participant was made aware of the presence of the two groups, but not told which group they \nwere assigned to. However, the scientists knew the group to which the participants were assigned.\n\u2022 At the beginning of the trial (Week 0), participants were interviewed and administered a computerised \ncognitive test to measure their symptoms and determine a baseline that measured their memory and  \nreaction times. \n\u2022 Participants were then called via phone every two weeks and administered the same test as that given in Week \n0. The test provides a total score based on their answers that measures the severity of their symptoms from a \nscale of 10\u201370, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. \n\u2022 At the conclusion of Week 12, the participant\u2019s scores were collated and analysed. The participant was also \nasked to complete the same computerised cognitive tests as at their baseline appointment, as well as a 1.5 hour \ndebriefing session with the in-house clinical psychologist. \n\u2022 At the conclusion of the twelve weeks, researchers collated and analysed the data.Chapter 1: General Skill S 48\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

Recently, research has \nsuggested that antidepressants may have both a pharmacological effect and a placebo effect, meaning that the placebo \neffect only enhances the effect of the drug itself. For instance, Cipriani et al. (2018) found that antidepressants do have \na significant effect compared with placebo alone, while research from Sapirstein & Kirsch (1998) suggests that around \n25% of the impact of antidepressants is due to placebo, 25% is due to unknown factors, and the remaining 50% is due \nto the actual pharmacological effects from the drugs. Since this research in the late 1990s, however, Kirsch has changed \nmuch of his assumptions and now questions the role of any pharmacological effects at all.\nUltimately, due to this uncertainty, it can take several trials with different medications before finding one that helps \na particular patient. What\u2019s more, doctors have plenty of contributing factors to consider when prescribing the right \nantidepressant, including things like the age, medical history, family psychiatric history, and life circumstances of \nthe patient. It is also important to consider the potential side effects of some antidepressants, which can range from \ninsomnia, rashes, headaches, and joint pain to more serious problems associated with long-term usage such as reduced \nblood clotting capacity. \n10 Based on the information provided in the second paragraph, identify the bioethical issue associated with the \nprescription of antidepressants. \u2002(1 MARK) \n11 With reference to a consequences-based approach to bioethics, how might an opponent of antidepressants critique \nthe current nature of trial and error prescriptions? \u2002(2 MARKS) \n12 With reference to the bioethical concept of beneficence, how might a supporter of antidepressants promote the \ncurrent trial and error method of antidepressant prescribing? \u2002(2 MARKS) \nFor more information regarding the treatments that are available for depression, see here:  \nbeyondblue.org.au/the-facts/ depression/treatments-for-depression\nREVIEW49\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

Examples of this include plant \ntips growing towards a light source.\n4 Growth \u2013 all living things grow and develop over time. An example is how infants grow \ninto adults. \n5 Reproduction \u2013 all living things can produce new living things. Examples include cell \ndivision and sexual reproduction.\n6 Equilibrium \u2013 all living things can maintain a relatively stable internal environment \nunique to an individual species, which is known as maintaining homeostasis .  \nThis allows organisms  to tolerate environmental changes such as varying temperatures \nor a lack of water availability.\n7 Excretion \u2013 all living things produce wastes that must be removed. Urine or dead cells, \nif not removed, can become toxic.\n8 Nutrition \u2013 all living things extract nutrients from the environment, which are used to \nproduce cellular energy, grow and develop, and maintain equilibrium. Some organisms \ngain nutrition by consuming food (heterotrophs), whereas others produce their own \nessential nutrients from simple inorganic molecules (autotrophs).\nTo put this into practice, think about when you get sick. Bacteria and viruses are two \ndifferent \u2018pathogens\u2019 that cause disease, however the way they are treated is very different. \nAntibiotics can be used to fight bacterial infections, however are ineffective to viral \ninfections. This is partly because bacteria are living, whilst viruses are not. Viruses do \nnot satisfy all the requirements of a living thing as they cannot independently respire, \nconsume nutrients, maintain homeostasis, nor excrete wastes. They also rely on host cells \nto reproduce. Bacteria, meanwhile, fulfil all eight qualities of living things.\nCell theory\nIn addition to the MRS GREEN requirements for life, all organisms also function \naccording to cell theory .

Instead, the dominant theory \nused to be Aristotle\u2019s theory of \u2018spontaneous generation\u2019, which stated that organisms randomly arise \nfrom unrelated objects. For example, fleas were thought to be generated from dust, and maggots arose \nfrom dead flesh. Nowadays, this theory seems bizarre but it was not disproven until the 19th century, \nnearly 2 000 years after Aristotle, by showing that maggots only arose from dead flesh because flies had \nlaid eggs in them. So, even though cell theory seems obvious, it was an important discovery that is core \nto understanding biological systems.2a the OrY 57\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

For example, the complete classification for \nmodern humans is: Animalia, Chordata, Mammalia, Primates, Hominidae, Homo, sapiens . Due to lengthiness, we often shorten \norganism scientific names down to the genus and species level, hence modern humans are also known as Homo sapiens . \nThe classification systems of First Nations\u2019 Australians take a very different approach to classifying organisms. Their system \nfocuses on binary characteristics such as whether it is edible or inedible, or whether it is totemic (a sacred object) or  \nnon-totemic. In addition, it accounts for an organism\u2019s age, the stage in its life-cycle, sex, and how it can be used by people. \nThis grouping system contrasts with the Linnaean taxonomy which groups organisms by relatedness, which means there  \ncan be distinct differences in the way the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and western science describe an \norganism. For example, First Nations\u2019 Australians group turtles, barramundi, and dugongs together because they are aquatic \norganisms that have fins or flippers. Meanwhile, the Linnaean taxonomy classifies turtles as reptiles, barramundi as ray-finned \nfish, and dugongs as mammals.\nAlthough these systems have distinct differences, it is important to note that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people\u2019s \ndeep understanding of plants and animals heavily assisted western science in developing their classification of native \nAustralian organisms.

They inspected it under a microscope and found that it \nhad membrane-bound organelles, so it had to be eukaryotic. In addition, it was found that the cell can be part of more complex \ntissues or organs and therefore cannot be from a protist. This left scientists wondering whether it was an animal, plant, or \nfungus. Key characteristics of fungi cells are that they are surrounded by a chitin cell wall (unlike a plant\u2019s cellulose cell wall), \nand they do not contain chloroplasts. The scientists proposed two different methods to classify the organism.\nMethod 1: Cell wall staining\nStaining is the method of creating contrast in the colours of different structures at a microscopic level. Scientists applied a \ndual-stain that contained trypan blue (which turns chitin red) and aniline blue (which turns cellulose yellow/ green) to the \nrecently discovered specimen. They also took a known sample of an animal, plant, and fungal tissue and applied the stain to \nthese three samples. They planned to align the colour of the mystery cell with the matching colour shown in one of the three  \nknown samples.\nMethod 2: Photosynthesis testing\nScientists set up four sealed micro test tubes, each with a source of light, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and water. The levels of \noxygen and carbon dioxide were initially recorded. In each test tube, either the unknown sample, or a known plant, animal, or \nfungal cell was added. After three hours, the concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide were recorded. Chapter 2: What are CellS? 72\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

You then substitute these values into \nthe following formula: volume = length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height. \ntable 1\u2002 Worked example of calculating the volume of a rectangular prism\n1 Measure each edge of the object\n4 cm2 cm1 cm\nlength = 4 cm\nwidth = 1 cm\nheight = 2 cm\n2 Substitute values into the formula volume = length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height\nvolume = 4 cm \u00d7 1 cm \u00d7 2 cm\nvolume = 8 cm3\nFrom the example given in Table 1, this object could contain 8 cm3, or 8 mL, of liquid \ninside it.\nWhat is surface area?\nSurface area  is the sum of the area of each of the faces of a three-dimensional object.  \nThis means that to work out the surface area of a prism, we must do the following steps:\n1 Identify the length of each unique edge, and establish which side is your length, width, \nand height (doesn\u2019t really matter which you choose).\n2 a If all edges are the same length (such as for a cube), calculate the area of any one  \n face, and multiply the area of the one side by the number of faces in the shape\nb If the edges vary in length, calculate the area of:\ni face A \u2013 length \u00d7 width\nii face B \u2013 length \u00d7 height\niii face C \u2013 width \u00d7 height.\n Then multiply each face area by 2, and add them all together.\nIt is important to note that surface area is always measured in units2 (so cm2 or m2).Think of how long it would  \ntake you to run from the \nboundary line of your school \noval all the way into the  \nmiddle and then back out  \nto the boundary (approximately \n75 m each way).

  "Page 90": "What is surface area : volume ratio?\nA ratio  is a mathematical representation showing the relative proportions of two things. \nRatios operate in a similar way to fractions in that we try to simplify them down as small \nas possible. For example, Granny Smith\u2019s fruit bowl has 10 apples and 2 oranges. We would \nwrite this ratio as 5 apples : 1 orange, not 10 apples : 2 oranges. This means for every one \norange, there are five apples. We can also look at ratios in terms of the total, so the ratio of \napples to the total fruit count in the bowl is 10 : 12, which can be simplified to 5 : 6. This \nreads as, for every six pieces of fruit, five of them are apples.\nIn terms of surface area : volume ratio , it works the same way. For every cm3 of volume, \nhow many cm2 of surface area are there?\nTo calculate the SA:V of an object we must take the following steps:\n1 Calculate surface area\n2 Calculate volume\n3 Calculate (surface area)/(volume) to work out every unit of surface area per unit  \nof volume\n4 Convert into a ratio.\nLet\u2019s do this calculation for the rectangular prism used in Table 1 and Table 3.\ntable 4\u2002 Worked example of calculating the surface area to volume ratio of a rectangular prism\n1 Calculate surface area\n4 cm2 cm1 cm\nsurface area = 28 cm2\n2 Calculate volume volume = 8 cm3\n3 Calculate (surface area)/(volume) to work out \nevery unit of surface area per unit of volumeSA/V = 28 / 8\nSA/V = 3.5\n4 Convert into a ratio SA:V = 3.5 : 1\nMaximising surface area to volume ratio\nSmaller objects have larger surface area to volume ratios (Table 5).\ntable 5\u2002 Influence of size on surface area to volume ratio\n1 cm 1 cm 1 cm 1 cm\n1 cm 1 cm 1 cm 1 cm\n1 cm 1 cm 1 cm 1 cm\nsurface area 6 cm224 cm254 cm296 cm2\nvolume 1 cm38 cm327 cm364 cm3\nSA:V 6 : 1 3 : 1 2 : 1 1.5 : 1\nSize isn\u2019t the only influence on SA:V .

This means that \nobjects with long lengths and short depths and widths are likely to have a higher SA:V .\nAnother way to figure out the surface area is to count how many squares you can see on \nthe faces of each of the shapes in Table 6. Then double that number to account for all the \nfaces on the other side of the shape. We can see 12 squares on the left shape, 14 squares \non the middle shape, and 17 squares on the right shape, once we double to account for the \nhidden faces, we end up with 24, 28, and 34 respectively.\nSurfaces and cells with high SA:V\nSurfaces, which are made up of many cells, are able to exchange substances with the \nenvironment most effectively if they have a high SA:V . Therefore, both surfaces and \ncells that need to transport lots of substances across their border tend to be small \nand elongated. For instance, in the small intestine, which is responsible for absorbing \nnutrients, cells lining the intestine arrange into \u2018finger-like\u2019 shapes called villi. Some \nof these cells even have smaller \u2018finger-like\u2019 shapes of their own on their surface called \nmicrovilli that fold in and out to increase their surface area. By having both villi and \nmicrovilli, the surface area of the lining inside the small intestine can be greatly increased, \nwhich leads to an increased SA:V (Figure 3).\ngastrointestinal tractsmall intestine a fold of the\nintestinal liningvillivillimicrovilli\nepithelial cell\nwith microvilli\nImage: Tefi/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 3\u2002 Maximising the surface area to volume ratio in the small intestine\nTheory summary\nCells are microscopic in size so that they maximise their surface area to volume ratio and \nincrease the efficiency of transport.\nNo no, the answer is not ordering Uber eats.

Vomiting, difficulty swallowing, and diarrhoea are early symptoms of Leigh \ndisease in infants.\nLeigh disease particularly affects the enzymes involved in aerobic cellular respiration found in the mitochondria.  \nAerobic cellular respiration is a complicated metabolic process that converts the food we eat into energy that our body \ncan use to power critical biological processes needed for regular function. The equation for aerobic cellular respiration is:\nglucose + oxygen \u2192 carbon dioxide + water + energy\n1 Identify the inputs and outputs of aerobic cellular respiration.\u2002 (1 MARK)\n2 Leigh disease often leads to an inability to gain weight. Identify which symptoms are related to the inability to gain \nweight and explain how they would cause this.\u2002 (2 MARKS)\n3 A common symptom of Leigh disease is the weakness of limbs, also known as peripheral neuropathy. Explain why \nthis could occur.\u2002 (2 MARKS)\nThe mitochondrion\nUnlike most other organelles, mitochondria contain their own loop of DNA. \nThese contain thirty-seven genes responsible for the healthy functioning \nof the mitochondria. The diagram shows some of the important structures \nfound in the mitochondria.\nLeigh disease can be caused by a mutation in one of 75 different genes, \nmost of which play important roles in aerobic cellular respiration.  \nMost of these genes are found in the nucleus but some of them are found \nin mitochondrial DNA, and mutations in these genes arise spontaneously \nin sperm or egg cells before a baby is conceived. \nMutations may also be caused by environmental factors known as mutagens. UV radiation, smoking, and alcohol  \nare examples of common mutagens. The effect of mutations also drastically varies. \u2018Silent\u2019 mutations have no effect  \non an individual, whereas \u2018block\u2019 mutations in a sperm or egg cell can lead to life-changing diseases and miscarriages  \nin foetuses. Luckily, eukaryotic organisms have developed molecules to proofread DNA and repair mutations.  \nWhile mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has a much higher mutation rate than nuclear DNA, the importance of the genes \nencoded by mtDNA mean that mutations in coding regions are usually undesirable. Consequently, the coding regions of \nmtDNA tend to be highly conserved, meaning it mutates at a low rate.\n4 State whether mitochondria are found in prokaryotes, eukaryotes, or both.\u2002 (1 MARK)\n5 Name another organelle apart from mitochondria or nucleus that also contains its own DNA, and explain why this \norganelle is/isn\u2019t found in an animal cell.\u2002 (2 MARKS)\n6 Scientists believe mitochondria may have initially survived as unicellular organisms similar to bacteria until they \nwere engulfed by another larger organism.

The second approach allows for the father\u2019s sperm  \nto fertilise the mother\u2019s egg.

Phospholipids have a  phosphate head  and two fatty acid tails . \nThe phosphate head and fatty acid tails are chemically very different from each other. \nThe phosphate head is:\n\u2022 made of a glycerol and phosphate group\n\u2022 negatively charged, making it hydrophilic (\u2018water-loving\u2019) and polar . \nThe two fatty acid tails are:\n\u2022 made of long chains of carbon and hydrogen \n\u2022 uncharged,  hydrophobic (\u2018water-fearing\u2019), and nonpolar .\nThe phosphate heads are hydrophilic so they are attracted to water which is a polar \nsubstance. Therefore, they are attracted to, and oriented towards, the aqueous intra- and \nextracellular environments. The fatty acid tails orient themselves away from the intra- and \nextracellular fluid to form the middle portion of the bilayer (Figure 2). \nphosphate\nglycerol\nhydrophilic \nhead\nhydrophobic\ntails2 \u00d7 fatty acid\ntails\npolar head\nnonpolar tailsextracellular\nintracellularphospholipid\nbilayerhydrophobic tail\nhydrophilic \nhead\nCH/two.supCH CH/two.sup\nO\nCOO\nCOOPOR\nO O-\n-\nFigure 2\u2002 The structure of a phospholipid and the phospholipid bilayer\nBecause phospholipids have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts, they are \namphipathic  molecules.

The membrane is made up of a phospholipid bilayer. Phospholipids have \na polar/hydrophilic phosphate head and two nonpolar/hydrophobic fatty acid tails. \nCholesterol regulates membrane fluidity, carbohydrates attach to phospholipids and \nproteins which play a role in cell signalling and adhesion, and proteins are involved in \ntransport and enzymatic reactions. The structure of the plasma membrane is described by \nthe fluid mosaic model, in which a myriad of proteins and other molecules are embedded \nwithin the membrane and can freely move around.MOLECULES THAT REGULATE MEMBRANE FLUIDITY\nFluctuating temperatures can affect membrane fluidity. When it is hot the kinetic energy of molecules \nincreases, so the fluidity of the plasma membrane increases. This means that phospholipids are at risk of \ndrifting apart, creating holes in the membrane. Meanwhile, in cold environments, the plasma membrane \nmay become too stiff and impair the transport of substances into and out of the cell. Cells of organisms \nin extreme environments may alter the types of fatty acids and amount of cholesterol to regulate \nmembrane fluidity (Figure 7 and Table 2). Fatty acids can be saturated like those that make up butter, \nwhich is solid at room temperature or unsaturated like those that make up oil, which is liquid at room \ntemperature.\nSaturated\nfatty acidsMixture of saturated &\nunsaturated fatty acids\nFigure 7\u2002 Saturated (left) fatty acids mean phospholipids can pack tightly, unsaturated (right) fatty acids on \nphospholipids can lead to more fluid membranes.\nT able 2\u2002 The role of cholesterol and fatty acid type in regulating membrane fluidity\nHot  \nenvironmentCold \nenvironmentExplanation\nAmount of \ncholesterolLots Lots Cholesterol has large hydrophobic regions which can \nincrease the nonpolar interactions between fatty acid \ntails in hot environments, keeping the fatty acid tails \nfrom drifting apart.

This occurs due to the \nkinetic energy  stored inside each molecule, which causes them to randomly move around \nand bounce off each other. Over time, this random movement leads to an even dispersion \nof particles in an area.

However, if a small molecule is highly charged \u2013 like an ion (e.g. H+, K+, Cl\u2013) \u2013 \nthen it still can\u2019t cross the membrane by simple diffusion.\nTherefore, only small, nonpolar molecules can freely diffuse across the phospholipid \nbilayer. Large and  hydrophilic molecules, such as ions, amino acids, proteins, glucose, \nor nucleic acids however, will simply bounce off the membrane and be unable to diffuse \nthrough.

  "Page 116": "Will the nonpolar, small molecules diffuse into or out of the cell?\nMolecules diffuse into or out of the cell depending on their concentration on either \nside of the plasma membrane. Let\u2019s use O2 as an example. If the extracellular fluid has a \nhigher concentration of O2 than the cytosol, then O2 will diffuse into the cell. But, if the \nconcentration of O2 is higher inside the cell than outside the cell, then O2 will diffuse out of \nthe cell and into the extracellular fluid. As these small, nonpolar molecules always diffuse \nfrom areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration, we say they are moving \n\u2018down\u2019 their concentration gradient.\nTimeSolute concentration\nhigher on one side\nof membraneSolute will move across\nmembrane towards\nlower concentrationOnce equilibrium is reached,\nsolute moves equally \nin both directions \nImage: Aldona Griskeviciene.Shutterstock.com\nFigure 4\u2002 The diffusion of small, nonpolar molecules across the plasma membrane. \nDiffusion is faster when the concentration gradient is steeper \u2013 that is, when there is a \ngreater difference in concentration between the intra- and extra-cellular environments.  \nIt will also speed up at higher temperatures.Go back to lesson 3A  if you \ncan\u2019t remember the terms \nhydrophobic, hydrophilic,  \npolar,  and nonpolar.  \nYou should understand that \nbecause the plasma membrane \nis mostly hydrophobic, \nhydrophobic molecules are \neasily transported across.  \nIn contrast, hydrophilic \nmolecules cannot diffuse \nstraight across the membrane \nas they are repelled by the \nhydrophobic fatty acid tails.\nDiffusion doesn\u2019t just occur in cells. Diffusion is something we can \nsee (or smell) in everyday life. Think of a strong perfume (or an \nunwanted passing of gas). When someone sprays it, the perfume \nmolecules are initially concentrated in one location. Over time, \nthe molecules move to areas of low concentration, spreading \nthroughout the room. So the expression \u2018he who smelt it dealt it\u2019 \nis true \u2013 the dealer will be the first person to smell their perfume \nbefore it diffuses throughout the room.\nImage: MBLifestyle/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 5\u2002 Gases spread out evenly \nthroughout a room over time.\nFacilitated diffusion \u20021.1.4.5\nOverview\nMolecules that are too large or too charged to freely cross the plasma membrane can use a \nmembrane protein, such as a protein channel, to move down their concentration gradient \ninto or out of the cell. This process is called facilitated diffusion.\nTheory  details\nFacilitated diffusion  is the passive movement of molecules down their concentration \ngradient through a membrane-bound protein. This allows large and/or polar molecules \nlike glucose and ions to move between the intra- and extra-cellular environments via the \nuse of a  protein channel  or a carrier protein . \n\u2022 Protein channels are pores or holes in the membrane that let a specific substance through. facilitated diffusion\u2002 a type  \nof passive transport where \nmolecules move through a \nphospholipid bilayer with  \nthe aid of a membrane protein\nprotein channel\u2002 a transmembrane \nprotein pore in a phospholipid \nbilayer that selectively enables \ntransport of large or polar \nmolecules\ncarrier protein\u2002 a membrane \nprotein that undergoes \nconformational change to \ntransport molecules across  \na membrane3B THEORY 105\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

They return to their original shape once the molecule \nhas been transported.\nBoth channels and carrier proteins are specific to the molecule they transport. This \ncontributes to the selective permeability of the plasma membrane. Because facilitated \ndiffusion can be faster than simple diffusion, some small and/or nonpolar molecules that \ncan diffuse (like water) also have dedicated protein channels.\nOsmosis \u20021.1.4.6\nOverview\nOsmosis is the diffusion of water from an area of low solute (high solvent) concentration \nto an area of high solute (low solvent) concentration.\nTheory  details\nOsmosis  is the diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane from areas  \nof low solute concentration to areas of high solute concentration. Water molecules can \nmove through the phospholipid bilayer despite being hydrophilic due to how extremely \nsmall they are, water movement can be increased by protein channels known as \naquaporins. \nOsmosis is important as the selectively permeable nature of the membrane means that \nmany solutes cannot cross it easily, but water can. So, if there is a high concentration \nof sugar molecules in the cytosol compared to the extracellular fluid, water moves \ninto the cell. This dilutes the sugar molecules until their concentration is equal both \ninside and outside the cell. The alternative is that the sugar molecules move down their \nconcentration gradient out of the cell through facilitated diffusion, but it is usually easier \nfor water to cross the membrane.\nIn the example above, there is a higher concentration of solute (sugar molecules) \ninside the cell compared to outside the cell. When we describe differences in solute \nconcentrations between two compartments, we use the term tonicity (Figure 7). There are \nthree different types of tonicity that can characterise a solution: \n\u2022 hypertonic solutions have comparatively higher solute concentrations, so water moves \ninto a hypertonic solution from adjacent areas with lower solute concentrations. \n\u2022 isotonic solutions have equal solute concentrations, so there is no net movement of \nwater. It\u2019s important to note that there is still movement of water into and out of a \ncompartment, but the rate of water moving in is equal to the rate of water moving out \nso the net movement is zero.\n\u2022 hypotonic  solutions have comparatively low solute concentrations, so water moves \nfrom a hypotonic solution into adjacent areas with a higher solute concentration.\nDirection of water movement No net movement of water\nSEMI-PERMEABLE MEMBRANESEMI-PERMEABLE MEMBRANETime for \nosmosis \nto occur\nHypotonic\nsolutionHypertoni c\nsolutionIsotoni c solutionSolute molecule\nWater molecule\nFigure 7\u2002 A model of osmosis.

It is caused by \nmalfunctions in the CFTR protein channel. When working properly, CFTR controls the facilitated diffusion of chloride across \nmembranes. When it doesn\u2019t work, CFTR is unable to help move chloride to the cell surface. Without the chloride to attract \nwater out of the cell via osmosis, mucus in organs like the lungs and guts becomes thick and sticky. This can lead to difficulties \nin breathing and a high risk of lung infection. As the average life expectancy for a person born with cystic fibrosis is around 40 \nyears old, many scientists are researching ways to improve the quality and length of life.\nResearchers wanted to test if a particular treatment improved lung function in people with cystic fibrosis. The treatment \ninvolved inhaling 7% hypertonic salt (saline) solution twice daily. The standard salt concentration inside cells is 0.9%.  \nTwo methods were proposed:\nMethod 1\n\u2022 one group of 100 people with stable cystic fibrosis, where individuals inhale 4 mL of 7% saline solution twice daily  \nfor 48 weeks\n\u2022 a second group of 100 people with stable cystic fibrosis, where individuals inhale 4 mL of 0.9% saline solution twice daily \nfor 48 weeks.\nMethod 2\n\u2022 one group of 100 people with stable cystic fibrosis, where individuals inhale 4 mL of 7% saline solution twice daily  \nfor 48 weeks\n\u2022 a second group of 100 people without cystic fibrosis, where individuals inhale 4 mL of 0.9% saline solution twice daily  \nfor 48 weeks.\nFor both methods, lung function and instances of bacterial infection were measured before, after, and during the 48 week trial.3B QUE sTIO ns 109\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

Sometimes, there is a big \ndifference in the concentration of substances inside the cell compared to outside the cell. \nTake Figure 2a, for example. In this instance, there is a higher concentration of potassium \nions (K+) inside the cell compared to the extracellular fluid. Despite this, the cell may still \nrequire more K+ to function optimally \u2013 so it must somehow draw the K+ into the cytosol , \nagainst its concentration gradient. To make matters more difficult, K+ cannot simply \ndiffuse across the plasma membrane as it is a charged molecule. Furthermore, the cell \ncannot use facilitated diffusion either, as K+ ions need to move against its concentration \ngradient. In this scenario, the cell must use energy and  protein pumps  to move the ions \nagainst their concentration gradient and into the cytoplasm (Figure 2b). \nThere are many situations when a molecule must be transported against its concentration \ngradient, but they all require:\n\u2022 energy, usually in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)\n\u2022 membrane proteins, typically protein pumps and  carrier proteins .\nThe process of active transport occurs in the following three steps:\n1 Binding \u2013 the target molecule for transport binds to a specific protein pump\n2 Conformational change  \u2013 energy released from the reaction ATP _ ADP + Pi causes a \nconformational change in the protein pump.

  "Page 126": "Bulk transport \u20021.1.4.8\nOverview\nBulk transport, the movement of groups of molecules across the plasma membrane,  \ncomes in two forms: exocytosis and endocytosis.\nTheory  details\nBulk transport is a type of active transport that moves large molecules or groups of \nmolecules \u2013 such as amino acids, proteins, signalling molecules, or pathogens \u2013 into or \nout of the cell using vesicles . There are two types of bulk transport:  exocytosis , which \ninvolves molecules exiting the cell, and endocytosis  which involves molecules entering \nthe cell.\nExocytosis\nExocytosis is the process by which the contents of a vesicle are released from a cell. \nOften, proteins are made at ribosomes located on the surface of the  rough endoplasmic \nreticulum , sorted, packaged, and modified at the Golgi apparatus , and then transported \nby vesicles to the plasma membrane for exocytosis. This is an important process because \ncells often need to release products such as hormones, neurotransmitters, and antibodies \nin large amounts. Alternatively, molecules that are too large to cross the membrane \nthrough a protein channel undertake exocytosis. There are three steps in exocytosis \n(Figure 5):\n1 Vesicular transport \u2013 a vesicle containing  secretory products is transported to the \nplasma membrane\n2 Fusion \u2013 the membranes of the vesicle and cell fuse\n3 Release \u2013 the secretory products are released from the vesicle and out of the cell.osmosis\u2002 the passive transport of \na solvent (typically water) through \na semipermeable membrane \nfrom a region of low solute (high \nsolvent) to a region of high solute \n(low solvent)\nTHE SODIUM\u2013POTASSIUM (N a+/K+) ION PUMP\nThe sodium-potassium (Na+/K+) protein pump maintains ideal concentrations of Na+ and K+ in the cell.  \nIt also plays a role in generating nervous impulses, which are caused by changes in the voltage of \ncell membranes of neurons. Na+ has a very high extracellular concentration, whilst K+ has a very high \nintracellular concentration. The sodium-potassium pump can be used to move Na+ out of the cell and K+ \ninto the cell.\nThe Na+/K+ pump works as follows:\n1 The cycle starts with the pump open to the cytoplasm, where it binds three Na+.\n2 ATP is broken down into ADP + Pi, and the ADP is released. Energy from this reaction causes the \npump to change shape and open to the extracellular space. In this new conformation, the pump does \nnot bond strongly to Na+ so these ions are released.\n3 Two K+ are bound to the pump, and this triggers the release of the free-floating phosphate, which was \nleftover following the breakdown of ATP in step 2.\n4 The pump changes shape again, opening to the cytoplasm and releasing K+ back into the cell.  \nThe cycle can start again.\nplasma\nmembrane\ncytoplasmextracellular spacesodium\nNa+potassium\nK+\nATP ADPNa+\nK+ concentration1 2 3 4\nFigure 4\u2002 The mechanism of the Na+/K+ pumpTherefore, pumping solutes into cells can result in water following passively via osmosis . \nSimilarly, to remove unwanted water, the cell can pump solutes into the extracellular \nspace and water will diffuse into the hypertonic region. \nvesicle\u2002 a small membrane-bound \nsac that transports or stores \nsubstances within a cell\nexocytosis\u2002 a type of bulk \ntransport that moves large \nsubstances out of the cell\nendocytosis\u2002 a type of bulk \ntransport that moves large \nsubstances into the cell\nribosomes\u2002 small RNA-protein \nstructures that are the site of \nprotein synthesis.

The best way to \nprevent this from happening is called oral rehydration therapy (ORT),  \nand is probably the drink that you have received from your parents in  \nthe past. \nThe aim of ORT is to fast-track absorption of both water and sodium \ninto the body. This is because dehydrated people lose large amounts of \nsodium along with water, and sodium is important for bodily functions. \nUnfortunately, ORT isn\u2019t as simple as drinking water mixed with sodium. \nThis is because protein pumps can only transport sodium out of the gut \nlumen when it is paired with glucose, using a type of active transport \ncalled secondary active transport. ORT drinks contain both sodium and \nglucose. After you drink them, sodium and glucose are absorbed inside \nyour gut epithelial cells, allowing water to follow them via osmosis as it \nmoves to the hypertonic region. \nOral rehydration salts contained in sachets like this are estimated to have \nsaved more than 70 million lives.phagocytosis\u2002 endocytosis of solid \nmaterial or food particles\npinocytosis\u2002 endocytosis of liquid \nor dissolved substances\n3C THEORY 117\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

This charge, between \u201340 and \u201390 millivolts, is called the \nresting membrane potential.

If you were grazed or scratched, you were at risk of \ndeveloping a life-threatening infection. Often, doctors could do little but make you comfortable while they hoped for the best. \nFortunately, this drastically changed with the discovery of the first antibiotic: penicillin.\nPenicillin was discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming. Fleming\u2019s discovery is often attributed to luck, leading him to say \n\u2018one sometimes finds what one is not looking for.\u2019 Returning from a holiday, he had observed an unexpected mould growing \nin a Petri dish colonised with the bacteria known as Staphylococcus . Surprisingly, the entire dish was covered with the bacteria \nexcept for a small area around the mould. This led Fleming to hypothesise that the mould was secreting a compound inhibiting \nbacterial growth. Later, he discovered that penicillin helped inhibit bacterial growth by interfering with cell wall synthesis in \nsome strains of bacteria.\nHowever, over time, bacteria have evolved to become resistant to penicillin-based antibiotics due to their widespread use. For \nexample, some bacteria can now produce chemicals which disable penicillin. The race is now on for scientists to develop new \nforms of antibiotics against these bacteria. Hopefully, just like Fleming, luck is on their side!\nQuestion  9 \nThe discovery of penicillin is largely attributed to\nA luck.\nB skill.Chap Ter 4: T he CeLL CYCL e 134\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

This is problematic because proteins, which \nare essential to all living organisms, are encoded by DNA. If DNA is lost or damaged, then certain proteins can no longer be \nmade. Fortunately, our bodies have evolved a solution to this problem: telomeres. \nTelomeres are stretches of DNA attached to the ends of chromosomes, and are shown as the white dots in the picture. Telomeres \ndo not encode proteins, but they are vital in protecting regions of coding DNA from being damaged during DNA replication.\nWhen the telomeres become too short, the cell initiates a programmed death sequence. Over time, as the number of cell \ndeaths accumulate, our body\u2019s tissues gradually deteriorate and the visible effects of ageing arise. \nResearch into telomeres has drastically advanced our understanding of the ageing process. By measuring telomere \ndegradation, we can measure the rate at which we age. While telomeres do shorten over time naturally, bacterial, viral, and \nfungal infections can speed up the process. Poor diet, lack of sleep, and dehydration also increase cellular ageing, but to a \nlesser extent.\nQuestion  11 \nTelomeres are\nA located at the ends of chromosomes.\nB located in the middle of chromosomes.\nQuestion  12 \nTelomeres are regions which\nA code for proteins.\nB do not code for proteins.\nQuestion  13 \nIf a cell undergoes programmed death, this may be caused by\nA long telomeres.\nB short telomeres. \nQuestion  14 \nFragments of telomeres are lost during\nA the G1 phase.\nB the G2 phase.\nC the S phase.\nD mitosis.\nQuestion  15 \nBacterial, viral, and fungal infections contribute heavily to ageing because such infections\nA cause cellular damage which requires an increase in cell replication.\nB specifically target telomeres.4B QU eSTIONS 145\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

Of these, scientists think that ~300 million die \nevery minute and are usually replaced by healthy cells. These cells typically die through \nthe natural process of apoptosis , commonly known as programmed cell death. When a \ncell begins to malfunction, is damaged, or becomes unnecessary it will receive signals that \ninitiate apoptosis, causing the eventual death of the cell. \nThere are two pathways of apoptosis: the mitochondrial  and the death receptor \npathways (Table 1), both of which cause the activation of caspase enzymes . Following \ncaspase activation, the two pathways become nearly identical. \nImage: Kateryna Kon/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 1\u2002 A model of a cell \nundergoing apoptosisapoptosis \u2002the controlled death of \ncells in the body.

For example, cells may no longer express functional death \nreceptor proteins, leading to an inability for death signalling molecules to initiate apoptosis \nBy failing to initiate, cells have a reduced rate of apoptosis.\nUnfortunately, when the rate of apoptosis decreases too much, cell growth can increase  \nexponentially, resulting in the formation of tumours . Tumours can be classified into two \ncategories:\n\u2022 benign tumours  \u2013 these are relatively slow-growing masses of cells that are generally \nenclosed within a capsule which prevents the abnormal cells from separating and \ninvading other parts of the body\n\u2022 malignant tumours  \u2013 the cells of some benign tumours can mutate further and \nbecome malignant when they gain the ability to invade nearby tissues and/or enter the \nbloodstream or lymphatic system.

However, in tumour cells, they can replicate without \nthese signals by either producing their own chemical signals, or by \npermanently activating cell growth and replication pathways. \nAntigrowth deactivation There are many different mechanisms present in cells to prevent cell \nreplication when it is not needed. In tumour cells, these mechanisms \ncan be disabled, thereby allowing cell replication to initiate.\nIncreased survival Due to mutations in the regulation of the cell cycle, apoptosis no \nlonger functions correctly in tumour cells. Tumour cells are also \ncapable of replicative immortality, which theoretically allows them \nto divide forever, enhancing their survival. However, in practice, due \nto limitations such as the inability for blood vessels to form in the \ncentre of tumours and provide the necessary nutrients, tumour cells \ncan still die. \nBlood supply formation Tumour cells can form new blood vessels when growing to maintain \nadequate nutrient and oxygen supply.\nTissue invasion and metastasis When benign tumour cells become malignant/ cancerous they ar e \ncapable of invading nearby layers of tissue and migrating to other \nparts of the body away from the primary tumour site, typically via the \nbloodstream or lymphatic system ( metastasis ).cancer\u2002 a disease caused by the \nuncontrolled replication of cells \nwith the ability to migrate to other \nparts of the body \nmetastasis\u2002 the migration of \ntumour cells from the primary \ntumour site to distant parts of  \nthe body\nFigure 4\u2002 Human lung cancerINCREASING APOPTOSIS: DISEASES AND DISORDERS\nApoptosis is sometimes kicked into overdrive, which makes healthy cells undergo programmed  \ncell death. \nMany neurological disorders (diseases that affect the nervous system) are linked to an increased \nrate of apoptosis in cells of the brain (e.g. neurons).

It is necessary for controlling total cell numbers \nin the body and for the removal of diseased or damaged cells. There are two pathways of \napoptosis initiation: the mitochondrial pathway (which recognises intracellular signals) and \nthe death receptor pathway (which recognises extracellular signals).\nFollowing caspase activation and apoptosis initiation, apoptosis involves the digestion of \ncell contents, the shrinking of the cell, and the blebbing and breakage of the cell. Following \napoptosis, apoptotic bodies are digested by phagocytes. CHApTER  4: T HE CEll C YClE 152\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

Bladder cancer involves the uncontrolled growth of cells which originate from the lining of the \nbladder. In an effort to combat the increasing rates of bladder cancers, scientists have turned to an unexpected ally: anthrax. \nAnthrax is a toxin released by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis  and is often associated with bioterrorism. When inhaled, \nindividuals develop severe breathing problems. The mortality rate of those infected with inhaled anthrax is 70\u201380% if early \ndetection and treatment do not occur. Jack et al. (2019) are now using a modified strain of the toxin which binds to a receptor \nlocated on the surface of cancerous bladder cells. The scientists hope that by injecting this modified strain of anthrax into \npatients, it will stimulate apoptosis in cancerous bladder cells.\nBefore scientists begin human trials, they have decided to experiment on terminally ill dogs. Fortunately, after five rounds of \nthe treatment, scientists documented a 30% reduction in the size of malignant tumours within dogs (Jack et al., 2019).

You can often find cancer and senescent cells in tissues which have \ninsufficient rates of apoptosis.\nCancer cells replicate extremely quickly and resist apoptosis. Masses of these cancer cells are called \u2018malignant tumours\u2019 \nand these tumours can cause health complications and even death. Current treatments for cancer often cause cancer \ncells to undergo apoptosis. For example, many chemotherapy drugs damage DNA within cancer cells. This damage is \nrecognised by the cell and the cell begins apoptosis.\nChemotherapy is considered effective when compared to other anticancer drugs but is criticised for low specificity as \nchemotherapy can cause apoptosis in a wide range of cell types.\nSenescent cells resist apoptosis but, unlike cancer cells, they do not replicate. While seemingly innocuous and difficult \nto identify, senescent cells can release molecules which cause inflammation in surrounding cells and rarely perform any \nuseful role. As senescent cells do not undergo apoptosis, they accumulate within certain tissues of the body and have \nbeen linked to ageing in humans.\n\u2018Senolytic\u2019 drugs recognise certain proteins only expressed by senescent cells and selectively initiate apoptosis in these \ncells. Studies have found that senolytic drugs can cause the release of cytochrome c within a cell. Mice treated with \nsenolytic drugs have an increased life expectancy of ~30% (Baker et al., 2016).

It is estimated that in 2019, over 4 200 individuals in \nAustralia were diagnosed with leukaemia and over 2 000 people died as a result of it. While there are many different \ntypes of leukaemia, the most common is acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). \nAML is caused by an alteration to the DNA of one type of stem cell (called a \nmyeloblast) located in our bone marrow. Normally, these stem cells differentiate \nvia a carefully regulated process into a variety of white blood cells which help fight \ninfections and keep us healthy. This alteration leads to the overproduction of white \nblood cells. As the production of white blood cells increases, the body cannot \nproduce as many red blood cells or platelets. Red blood cells are responsible for \ncarrying oxygen around the body, and platelets are responsible for the clotting of \nblood. Without sufficient oxygen, both the rate of aerobic cellular respiration and \nthe production of energy (ATP) decreases. Symptoms of AML include fatigue, easy \nbleeding and bruising, bone and joint pain, and weight loss.\n1 Myeloid stem cells can differentiate into myeloblasts, platelets, and red blood cells.

  "Page 178": "Treatment for AML\nOne possible treatment for AML is chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a treatment regimen composed of toxic drugs with \nthe aim of killing cancerous cells. In AML, chemotherapy targets leukaemia cells \u2013 the cancerous cells \u2013 by inducing \napoptosis. Many drugs used in chemotherapy are large hydrophilic molecules. This means that they cannot pass through \nthe plasma membrane. \nAt the end of each regimen of chemotherapy, doctors typically take a biopsy or a sample of the patient\u2019s bone marrow to \nassess whether the number of leukaemia cells is increasing or decreasing. Other diagnostic tools doctors use include blood \ntests and various imaging tests such as CT scans and PET scans. In the event that leukaemia cells are still increasing, the \ndoctor will either proceed with more chemotherapy, or they can recommend a peripheral blood stem cell transplant. \nIn peripheral blood stem cell transplants, doctors use high doses of chemotherapy or total body irradiation to kill \ncancerous cells. Doctors then collect peripheral blood stem cells from a donor and transfuse them into the patient\u2019s \nbloodstream using a drip. These stem cells then migrate to the patient\u2019s bone marrow and start producing normal blood \ncells. However, in more severe cases, doctors may instead opt for a bone marrow transplant instead of a peripheral blood \nstem cell transplant, directly transplanting a donor\u2019s bone marrow into the patient. \n7 How do doctors assess whether a patient requires a stem cell transplant? \u2002(1 MARK)\n8 Outline how a large hydrophilic chemotherapy drug could induce apoptosis in cells. \u2002(1 MARK)\n9 Suggest how chemotherapy may sometimes be ineffective at killing leukaemia cells. \u2002(1 MARK)\n10 In some cases, chemotherapy can irreversibly damage terminally differentiated cells. Explain whether these cells \nhave the ability to naturally regrow. \u2002(2 MARKS)\nNew research\nOn the surface of most cells in the body, there is a group of proteins which form a complex known as the major \nhistocompatibility complex (MHC). This complex identifies cells belonging to the body, and if a foreign cell does not \nhave the same MHC proteins as the body, the immune system is primed to destroy it. Therefore, to ensure the success \nof stem cell transplants, both the donor and patient must have cells with similar MHC proteins. Because of this, it can \nsometimes be very difficult to find donors with compatible MHC proteins on their stem cells.\nRecently, scientists have been researching the possibility of altering the MHC proteins on stem cells to match the \npatient. In doing so, they discovered a special chemical with this ability. As part of their research, they conducted a \nclinical trial. \nFirst, they established two large volunteer groups (around 50 people each) with similar health statuses. A stem \ncell sample was taken from every individual, to analyse their unique MHC proteins. In the first group, researchers \nadministered the volunteers with stem cells which had been converted to match their MHC proteins. In the second \ngroup, researchers simply reintroduced the volunteer to their own stem cells. Throughout the trial, the scientists \nmonitored whether the volunteers developed an immune response against the transplanted stem cells.\n11 State a hypothesis the scientists could be testing. \u2002(1 MARK)\n12 Identify the independent and dependent variables. \u2002(2 MARKS)\n13 The day before releasing the treatment to the open market, researchers discovered that the converted stem cells \ncaused adverse reactions within 1% of patients. Scientists were worried that this could delay the release of the \ntreatment, negatively impacting thousands of patients on waiting lists.\n Discuss whether the scientists should proceed with the release of the treatment to the public with reference to one \nrelevant bioethical concept. \u2002(2 MARKS)\nComplications of treatment\nFollowing total irradiation or high doses of chemotherapy, the number of white blood cells decreases.

This process is known \nas respiration and is typically carried out by an animal\u2019s respiratory and blood circulatory systems. Very simple animals, however, such as \nsponges, coral, and flatworms can exchange gases directly with the environment, they neither require a respiratory system to exchange gas nor \na blood circulatory system to transport these gases throughout their body. \nComplex animals are often too large to passively exchange gases with the \nenvironment, and therefore require more advanced respiratory systems and blood \ncirculatory systems. In humans, the primary organs of the respiratory system are \nthe lungs which carry out gas exchange, and the trachea which carries gas between \nyour lungs and the environment.\nIn an insect\u2019s respiratory system, air (and oxygen) enters the body through tiny \nholes called spiracles. Spiracles attach to a network of internal tubes called trachea. \nThis network, combined with an insect\u2019s open blood circulatory system, allows \noxygen to reach all the cells of the body.\nFish live in water, a liquid that generally only contains about 1% O2, compared to \nthe 21% of O2 in air. To compensate for this, fish have evolved extremely efficient \ngas exchange and respiratory systems. The primary organ of the respiratory system in fish are the gills, located on the side of their throat.  \nGills are made of several gill arches composed of specialised rows of filaments, which in turn are made of tightly packed lamellae. Fish breathe \nin water through the mouth and push it out between the gill arches and the lamellae. Because of the high surface area of the lamellae, oxygen \nand carbon dioxide can quickly and efficiently diffuse into and out of the gills. Oxygen is then transported from the gills around the body via the \nfish\u2019s blood circulatory system. \nImage: Aldona Griskeviciene & Kraska/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 9\u2002 Water is exposed to a large surface area of fish gills to increase respiration. \nspiracles\nImage: Aldona Griskeviciene/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 8\u2002 Insect spiracles5a the Ory 179\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

  "Page 193": "SAC skills questions\nBioethical deep dive\nUse the following information to answer Questions 8\u201313.\nOrgan donation is the process of removing organs from one person (a donor) and transplanting them into someone who is in \nneed of a replacement organ (a recipient). Tissue donation is also possible, and the majority of the time the recipient\u2019s body \naccepts the donated organ or tissue as part of their own body. While living donors can donate tissues or non-vital organs, \nmost donors are recently deceased. \nThe decision to donate organs after death is one that raises many potential implications and requires the assessment of \nbioethical concepts. To be able to donate organs in Australia, a person over the age of 18 must \u2018opt-in\u2019 to record their consent \nto donation after their death. Other countries, such as Spain, have an \u2018opt-out\u2019 policy for post-death organ donation.\nFollowing death, reasonable steps must also be taken by the designated doctor to determine if there were changes in  \nthe intent or wishes of the deceased. In Australia, the next of kin to the deceased must also consent to the organ transplant.  \nEthical issues arise if the deceased changed their consent prior to death, or if there is a difference in consent between the \ndeceased donor and their next of kin. \nQuestion  8 \nAn \u2018opt-out\u2019 policy for post-death organ donation \nA assumes a person consents to deceased donation unless they opt-out.\nB means that people are required to actively record their consent to be eligible to donate. \nQuestion  9 \nThe organ donation law in England transitioned from an opt-in system to an opt-out system in May 2020. The law was \nchanged to \nA increase the number of consenting donor adults to increase the availability of organ donations.\nB increase the respect placed on deceased individuals\u2019 bodies by only removing organs after they have declared  \ntheir consent.\nQuestion  10 \nHealth officials want to raise the rate of deceased organ donation in Australia. One change that would increase the  \ndonation rate is\nA the removal of the next of kin\u2019s approval of a willing deceased donor.\nB including additional steps to uncover if a consenting deceased donor changed their consent after opting in.\nQuestion  11 \nConsider the following scenario under the current Australian system. A deceased person consented to donate before death \nand a suitable recipient is available, but the next of kin to the deceased objects to the donation. Which bioethical concept does \nAustralian law adhere to when influencing a doctor\u2019s decision to operate?\nA Respect. Under the current Australian law the beliefs of the deceased next of kin\u2019s need to be followed and respected. \nB Beneficence. The maximisation of benefits should be achieved by donating the deceased organ to the recipient to  \nimprove their life.\nQuestion  12 \nLike all operations, there are risks and complications associated with organ donation procedures. Which bioethical concept \nshould be followed when informing the potential recipient of the operation risks?\nA Non-maleficence. Doctors and health professionals responsible for the recipient should ensure that harm is avoided at  \nall costs.\nB Integrity. Doctors and health professionals have a commitment to present all information on procedures for the patient to \nmake their own informed decision, even if there are risks and dangers.Chapter 5: Bi OlOgiCal systems 182\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

  "Page 197": "Theory  details\nEveryone knows that plants can\u2019t live without water. But what is it about water that makes \nit so special? For a start, water is involved in:\n\u2022 metabolic reactions like photosynthesis\n\u2022 transporting nutrients and waste around the plant\n\u2022 preventing plants from overheating through evaporation\n\u2022 ensuring cells have the right tonicity\n\u2022 preventing wilting and/or damage from dehydration in the plant.\nVery simple plants, such as mosses or liverworts, can passively transport water, nutrients, \nand wastes without the need for complex transport systems. This is because they have a \nhigh surface area to volume ratio, and substances simply diffuse across the small distances \naround the plant. However, larger and more complex plants like trees and shrubs need \nnutrients and water to reach every cell in an organism that could be over 100 m long.  \nTo solve this problem, some plants \u2013 called vascular plants  \u2013 have evolved specialised cells, \ntissues, organs, and systems that transport materials around, into, and out of the plant.\nIn lesson 5A, you learned that plants have two main systems, the root  and shoot  systems, \nwhich are composed of the three plant tissue types: dermal, ground, and vascular tissues . \nThe vascular tissues of plants transport water, nutrients, and minerals between these two \nsystems and throughout an entire plant. There are two main types of vascular tissue:\n\u2022 xylem tissue  \u2013 tubes that transport water, and minerals such as potassium, nitrogen, \nand phosphorus in one direction from the roots to the leaves of a plant\n\u2022 phloem tissue  \u2013 tubes that transport sugars and other nutrients around a plant in  \nboth directions.\nThe arrangement of vascular tissues is different between plant species. This lesson focuses \non the vascular systems of a group of flowering plants called dicots, which includes \neucalypts, fruit trees, and roses. For dicots, the vascular tissues are located in vascular  \nbundles  in the centre of roots and just below the bark of stems and trunks (Figure 1).

Firstly, you will consider the intake of water and minerals by the roots. \nSecondly, the cellular structure of the xylem and phloem will be explained and contrasted. \nThirdly, you will learn how water and minerals travel through the xylem. And finally, you \nwill learn how sugars and other nutrients travel through the phloem.\nIntake of water and nutrients\nThe root system has two major functions \u2013 to provide stability and support to a plant,  \nand to absorb the water and minerals from the soil that are required for complex plant life. \nHow the root system provides structure is relatively simple \u2013 the roots act as an \u2018anchor\u2019 in \nthe ground, preventing the plant from toppling over during strong winds.\nHow the roots absorb water and nutrients from the soil is slightly more complex .  \nFirstly, we know that diffusion occurs at a greater rate in structures with a high surface \narea to volume ratio. Therefore, roots aren\u2019t simply one large, lumpy structure. The root \nsystem has many different branches which increase the overall surface area for absorption. \nAdditionally, root hair cells  have finger-like projections which extend outwards, further \nincreasing the surface area of roots (Figure 2).\nrootsroot hairxylem\nphloem\nsoil particleswater and mineralsplant\nroot haircytoplasmnucleus\nvacuole\ncell wall\nImage: VectorMine/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 2\u2002 The structure of root hair cells and their location in a plant\nSecondly, there are two different pathways of water and nutrient absorption in roots  \u2013  \nthe extracellular pathway  and the cytoplasmic pathway :\n\u2022 extracellular pathway \u2013 water (and the solutes dissolved within it) diffuses into the \nroots in the gaps between cells.

The lower pressure in the leaf \ncreates a force that draws water up from the xylem. Because water likes to stick together  \n(a characteristic called cohesion), even more water is drawn up than would be expected. \nThis works the same way as when you \u2018suck\u2019 liquid up a straw \u2013 you create a lower pressure \nin your mouth compared to the atmospheric pressure, so water moves up the straw.\nAnother force, called capillary action , also helps water flow in the xylem. Capillary action \nis caused by the adhesion of water molecules to the surface of the xylem. This is the same \nforce that causes a meniscus to crawl up the side of a test tube. In small enough tubes, \nthis force of adhesion is large enough to basically \u2018pull the water up a tube\u2019.

The difference \nin pressure is at its absolute maximum when the Pinhale term is 0 kPa, otherwise known as a perfect \nvacuum. By plugging this Pinhale term into the equation, we can calculate that the maximum possible \nrecorded height is 10.3 m. This means that when the height of the water is 10.3 m, the weight of water \ndue to gravity is equal to the pressure pushing water up the straw, and the two forces balance each other \nout.

In contrast, larger tubes have more xylem walls but have lots of \nwater in the middle of the tube where no adhesive forces exist.

  "Page 204": "Theory  details\nFactors affecting transpiration rate\nWater vapour is lost by plants during transpiration. While transpiration is an essential \nprocess for all vascular plants, it does represent a significant and dangerous avenue of \nwater loss. Water loss leads to high solute concentrations and a reduction in turgidity, \nwhich in turn can damage the plant or cause it to wilt. The amount of water lost to \ntranspiration is largely dependent on the environmental conditions surrounding a plant. \nEnvironmental conditions that affect transpiration rates include:\n\u2022 temperature \u2013 at higher temperatures, more water evaporates from the leaves.\n\u2022 light \u2013 in high light conditions, stomata can open to increase the amount of  \nCO2 absorbed for photosynthesis, further increasing the amount of water lost  \nto transpiration.\n\u2022 humidity \u2013 at any temperature, air has a maximum amount of water vapour that can \nremain dissolved within it (or \u2018saturation point\u2019). As the humidity increases, less water \ncan evaporate into the air, and at 100% relative humidity, water cannot evaporate at all \nand transpiration cannot occur.\n\u2022 wind \u2013 on calm days, the water released from stomata stays near the leaf, creating a \nhumid layer of air on the leaf surface. On windy days, this humid layer is blown away, \nencouraging water vapour to exit the leaf.\n\u2022 water availability \u2013 when water availability is high the roots absorb more water.  \nThe plant can then afford to increase the rate of transpiration and lose more water.\nhumiditywater loss/transpiration\nwind\nwater availabilitylight/temperature\nImage: A lazur /Shutterstock.com\nFigure 12\u2002 Factors that affect the rate of transpiration in plants\nGuard cells regulate transpiration\nTwo guard cells  that surround the stomatal pore  regulate the opening and closing of \nstomata.

Water and nutrients are absorbed from the soil by the roots: water enters via the \nextracellular pathway, whilst nutrients and minerals enter via the cytoplasmic pathway.\nWater is transported up the xylem through its lignified vessel elements and tracheids, \nwhich are the hollowed-out husks of dead cells. Nutrients are transported throughout the \nplant using live sieve cells and companion cells, according to the source and sink theory.\nThe majority of water loss in vascular plants is caused by transpiration, which drags water \nup through xylem via capillary action, low pressures in the leaves, and cohesion of water \nmolecules. Transpiration is limited by the opening and closing of stomata \u2013 when stomata \nare open, transpiration is greatest, allowing the exchange of gases with the environment; \nwhen the stomata are closed, transpiration cannot occur, which limits water loss and \nglucose production.

This is enough water to fill your bathtub 100 times over, and \nthe reasons why cotton requires so much water mainly comes down to two factors. Firstly, cotton \nis a particularly water inefficient species with a high inherent rate of transpiration, meaning that it \nloses a bunch of water to evaporation. Secondly, most cotton is grown in more arid environments, so \ncotton crops cannot rely on natural rainfall. An inherently high transpiration rate, high temperatures, \nlow humidity, and low rainfall increase the transpiration rate of cotton crops, causing their water \nrequirements to shoot through the roof.\nIf the amount of water surprised you, don\u2019t worry, there are less water-intensive options \u2013 for instance, \ngrowing and harvesting bamboo uses less water.

For most \nanimals, food molecules must be made small enough before they can be transported across \nplasma membranes and into cells. Digestion  is the breakdown of large food molecules into \nsmaller forms that can cross plasma membranes and be used by the body. The system of \nspecialised tissues and organs responsible for digestion is the digestive system . \nThere are two methods of food digestion, which are both employed by humans:\n\u2022 Physical (or mechanical) digestion  \u2013 to be absorbed, food must first be broken into \nsmaller pieces as smaller pieces provide a relatively large surface area for digestion. \nPhysical digestion describes the processes whereby the mechanical movement \nof organs and tissues causes this breakdown of food into smaller pieces. These \nmovements include chewing, muscle contractions, and the stirring of food and \ndigestive juices by muscle movements. \n\u2022 Chemical digestion  \u2013 food pieces undergo chemical digestion by enzymes and stomach \nacid, producing smaller molecules that are capable of being absorbed. Most digestive \nenzymes split food molecules in hydrolysis reactions, by adding water molecules.  \nThe three major types of digestive enzymes are amylases (which act on carbohydrates), \nproteases (proteins), and lipases (lipids).\nOverall, digestion occurs via the following four steps:\n\u2022 Ingestion \u2013 the first step of the process is when food is taken into the body.  \nFor vertebrates such as humans, the teeth, saliva, and tongue play an important role  \nin ingestion. The teeth physically break down food into smaller pieces, whilst  \nenzymes in the saliva chemically break down the food pieces into a soft mass that  \ncan be swallowed.\n\u2022 Digestion \u2013 occurs along the digestive tract , where the soft mass travels from the \nmouth into the body of the organism and continues to be broken down both physically \nand chemically by a variety of organs. \n\u2022 Absorption \u2013 once the food macromolecules are broken down into smaller molecules, \nthey are absorbed across the plasma membrane of cells in the digestive tract into the \nbloodstream. It is here when the energy from food is ready to be used by the body. \n\u2022 Elimination/egestion \u2013 the final step is the elimination of undigested food content that \nhas travelled along the digestive tract and has not been absorbed. Undigested food is \neliminated from the body as faeces. \nNow that you know about the overall purpose and general mechanism of digestion, we\u2019ll \nnow take a closer look at the specialised organs and tissues involved to see exactly how the \ndigestive system fulfils its function. \nCells, tissues, and organs of the human digestive system \u20021.2.2.3\nOverview\nIn humans, the digestive system is made up of a number of organs including the stomach, \nliver, pancreas, and small and large intestines.

It is composed of different parts, including the mouth, oesophagus, and \nintestines. Within the walls of the alimentary canal, such as in the oesophagus, epithelial cells combine \nwith goblet cells and enteroendocrine cells. Goblet cells secrete mucus and fluid into the lumen  of the \ncanal, and enteroendocrine cells secrete hormones. These cells combine to form the epithelial tissue  \nof the oesophagus. \nThe epithelial tissue combines with connective and muscle tissues to form the mucosa tissue.  \nThis mucosa is surrounded by three other layers of tissue, including the submucosa, the muscular layer, \nand the serosa layer. Together, these tissues form the wall of the alimentary canal. The inner layers \nsecrete mucus, while the muscles of the outer layers contract and relax in a way that pushes food along \nthe canal.

These contractions occur right along the digestive tract, pushing food down the \noesophagus, through the stomach, and along the length of the small and large intestines.\nIn addition to propelling food through the digestive system, peristalsis also helps to mix the chyme in  \nthe intestines with digestive enzymes and bile to break down nutrients and aid their absorption. \nYou\u2019ve probably heard people saying how it\u2019s important to eat fibre in your diet.

Acidic juices and the churning of the \nsolution aids digestion further. Following the stomach, the partially digested pizza is \nnow called chyme which travels to the small intestine. When the chyme reaches the \nduodenum of the small intestine, it triggers the secretion of substances into the small \nintestine. Bile that was produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder is secreted \ninto the small intestine to break down fat molecules, as well as a variety of digestive \nenzymes from the pancreas.

To maximise absorption, the small intestine is long and contains a specialised surface, giving it a \nlarge surface area. The surface of the small intestine contains millions of tiny folds called villi. On top of \nthat, the epithelial cells lining the small intestine and its villi contain microvilli on their exposed surface, \nincreasing the surface area even more (Figure 5).\nAs it is also part of the alimentary canal that food passes through, the small intestine is composed of the \nsame four layers of tissue as the oesophagus. Villi and microvilli are part of the mucosa tissue layer that \nis exposed to the chyme. The increased surface area allows for greater exposure of digested food to the \nintestinal lining, where broken-down proteins, carbohydrates, and fats are absorbed through the tissue \nand put into circulation in the body.\nGastrointestinal tractSmall intestine A fold of the\nintestinal liningVilli\nVilli MicrovilliEpithelial cell\nwith microvilli\nMucosa\nSubmucosaMuscularis\nSerosa\nImage: Tefi/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 5\u2002 The small intestine is made up of specialised tissues and cells that all serve to increase the surface \narea of the organ.villus (pl. villi)\u2002 finger-like \nprojections from the surface \nof membranous structures to \nincrease the surface area \nmicrovillus (pl. microvilli)\u2002  \nmicroscopic projections on the  \nsurface of cells that increase \ncellular surface area 5C THEORY 205\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",
  "Page 217": "Theory  details\nDifferent animal species have different food requirements and feeding behaviours. A key \ndeterminant of the structure and specialisation of an animal\u2019s digestive system is its diet. \nHerbivores , omnivores , and carnivores  contain different digestive systems due to their \ndifferences in diet. \nOmnivores\nHumans are omnivores, meaning they consume a wide variety of food types when \ncompared to the diet of other animals like a domesticated cat or a sheep. Humans and \nother omnivores have populations of microorganisms living along their digestive tract \nknown as gut microbiota. Humans and their natural microbiota both benefit from \none another. The microbiota have somewhere to live and a supply of food, and human \ndigestion is aided by the microbiota\u2019s fermentation and breakdown of undigested food. \nThe large intestine in particular is home to a large amount of microbiota in omnivores. \nOmnivores typically have a combination of both sharp and blunt teeth that reflect a diet \nthat is both animal and plant-based. Figure 6 shows a comparison between the digestive \nsystem of humans, cats, and sheep. In humans, you can see that food travels from the \nstomach to the tightly folded small intestine, before travelling through the large intestine \nprior to elimination. \nCarnivores\nCats are carnivores, and as such their digestive system is comparatively simple overall. \nThey have sharp teeth, including large canine teeth, that rip and tear flesh off prey, and \ntheir jaws chew up and down. Carnivore digestive systems still contain gut microbiota, \nalthough because meat is dense and relatively easy to digest, it allows carnivores to have \nrelatively short digestive tracts. Similar to humans, food is still exposed to acid in the \nstomach, the majority of absorption occurs in the small intestine, and the large intestine \nserves to reabsorb water.\nHerbivores\nIn general, plant matter is harder to digest than animal matter. This is because digesting \ncellulose, the main molecule in plant cell walls, is long and difficult. This is why herbivores \nhave much longer digestive systems and far greater concentrations of gut microbiota \ncompared to carnivores and omnivores. In fact, herbivores have a fermentation site within \ntheir digestive system that contains an extremely high concentration of microbiota and \nis responsible for massive amounts of fermentation that aids digestion. There are two \ndistinct types of herbivore digestive systems: hindgut fermenters and foregut fermenters. \nHindgut fermenters contain single-chambered stomachs and extremely large cecums, \nwhich is the fermentation site. Foregut fermenters have multi-chambered, more complex \nstomachs and their fermentation site is the very large first stomach chamber.\nHerbivores have large flat teeth and their jaws move side to side which allows them to \ngrind their food. Because it is so difficult to break down cellulose, herbivores browse and \ngraze all day long in order to take in enough energy. The lengthy digestive tract provides \nenough time for the system and microbes to break down the tough plant material.

  "Page 218": "Now that you know how the digestive system works in both humans and other animals, \nyou can understand why certain foods help or hinder digestion. Ways to improve your \ndigestion include eating lean (low-fat content) meat and fish as they are easier to digest, \nand drinking plenty of fluids to encourage the passage of waste. Fruits and vegetables are \nhigh in vitamins and minerals that aid digestion and fibre that aids the movement  \nof waste. Regular exercise is also important as the muscles around the abdomen are \nresponsible for physical digestion. \nTo help digestion, it is best to limit fatty foods as fats take longer to break down and can \nlead to digestive issues like cramping and diarrhoea. The same can be said for sugary \nfoods as unused sugar can be converted into fats. Avoiding binge eating and heavily \nprocessed foods is critical to maintain digestive functioning. Lastly, caffeine and alcohol \nshould be limited as they can upset stomach acids. \nImage: magic pictures/Shutterstock.comAVIAN ANATOMY\nBirds face a number of special challenges when it \ncomes to digesting food. First, as they don\u2019t have \nteeth, birds\u2019 digestive systems must be able to \nprocess unchewed food. Secondly, birds need to \nkeep their weight low so that they can fly effectively. \nThis means that they need to digest food very \nquickly, as having a full stomach wouldn\u2019t be very \nfavourable for taking off! \nMany of the components of a bird digestive \ntract are very similar to that of a human as they \nare omnivorous, however, there are a few key \ndifferences to combat the challenges they face \nwhen it comes to digestion: \n\u2022 The crop is an area before the stomach  \nwhere food is temporarily stored until it is  \nready for digestion.\n\u2022 There are two chambers of the stomach; the proventriculus and the gizzard:\n \u2013Gastric juices aid digestion in the proventriculus\n \u2013Within the gizzard, food is stored, and mechanically ground. This mechanical breakdown in many \nbirds is aided by the presence of gastroliths, which are rocks and stones deliberately swallowed \nby the bird to store and help grind food. You read that right \u2013 many birds are walking and flying \naround with rocks inside their digestive system!\n\u2022 Waste is eliminated out of the cloaca. \n\u2022 Digestion occurs much faster in birds than in other animals as the metabolic rate of birds needs to be \nsignificantly higher to provide sufficient energy to fly.Oesophagus\nCloaca CecaCrop\nLiver\nGallbladderGizzardProventriculus\nSmall\nintestine\nFigure 7\u2002 Bird digestive systems are specialised \nto help digest unchewed food and to keep body \nweight low.\nTheory summary\nThe purpose of the digestive system is to rapidly break down food into small molecules \nthat can be absorbed by the small intestine and transported to cells throughout the body. \nDigestion takes place via physical and chemical processes. The digestive tract is comprised \nof the alimentary canal that transports food through the body and accessory organs that \naid digestion.

Faeces are usually a shade of brown due to the \npresence of a bile pigment called stercobilin, which is added during the formation of faeces. It is surprisingly common, \nhowever, particularly in children and babies, for faeces to be a different colour. \nFor example, many individuals experience green stools. This is caused by the individual\u2019s faeces having more bile acids than \nin normal faeces. If food is moving through the digestive system quickly, there isn\u2019t enough time for the green-coloured bile \nreleased into the small intestine to completely break down, resulting in green faeces. \nConsuming large amounts of certain foods can also alter faeces colour. Some food dyes, additives, and natural colours can\u2019t be \nfully broken down and colour faeces. Eating loads of green leafy vegetables containing large amounts of chlorophyll can cause \ngreen faeces, as can baby formulas that are high in iron. The antioxidant called anthocyanin in blueberries can lead to blue \nfaeces, beta carotene in carrots can cause orange faeces, whilst beetroot can colour faeces red. Typically, these colour changes \nare temporary but if they persist, your stool is white, or there is blood in your stool it is important to consult your GP. \nQuestion  9 \nGreen-coloured faeces could be caused \nA at night as digestion is slowed during sleep.\nB by diarrhoea as food passes through the digestive system too quickly.\nQuestion  10 \nBile is important in the breakdown of\nA fats.\nB carbohydrates. \nQuestion  11 \nBefore it is released into the small intestine, bile is stored in the\nA liver.\nB gallbladder.\nQuestion  12 \nStercobilin is present in the \nA large intestine. \nB small intestine.5C QUE sTiONs 209\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

In humans, when excess \namino acids are consumed in the diet, they are transported from the small intestine of the \ndigestive system to the liver . \nIn the liver, the amine group (NH2) of amino acids is converted to ammonia (NH3) in a \nprocess known as deamination. Ammonia is toxic to cells, so it is further broken down to \nless toxic urea  (Figure 2). Like ammonia, urea must be removed from the body, but unlike \nammonia, urea can be safely transported in the bloodstream. \nThis is where the excretory system comes in. The somewhat toxic urea in the blood is \ntransported to the kidneys . Here, urea is mixed with water and solutes to form urine , \nwhich is then excreted from the body.\nThe collection of interconnected organs involved in the production and excretion of urine \nare known as the urinary tract  (Figure 3).

  "Page 227": "The bladder\nAfter being produced in the kidneys, urine leaves each kidney via a tube known as a ureter  \n(Figure 3). The ureters carry urine to the bladder , where it remains until it is ready to be \nemptied. Upon being emptied, urine exits the body via the urethra .\nAdditional excretory organs of the body \u20021.2.2.7\nOverview\nAlthough the urinary tract is the main component of the excretory system, other organs \nsuch as the lungs, skin, liver, and digestive tract can be considered excretory organs. \nTheory  details\nTraditionally, the excretory system is described by the urinary tract. However, if you \nthink about it, other organs are involved in the release of waste products. For example, \nwhen cells undergo cellular respiration to release energy, carbon dioxide and water \nare produced. The water is incorporated into body fluids, and the carbon dioxide is \nreleased from the cells and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs , where it crosses \nrespiratory membranes and is exhaled into the surrounding environment of the organism.\nA small amount of nitrogenous waste and ions are removed from the body via sweating.  \nYour skin  can therefore be described as an excretory organ. It is important to remember, \nhowever, that sweating is mainly a method for controlling temperature rather than a way \nof removing waste. The liver can also be considered an organ of the excretory system as it \nbreaks down toxins and other waste materials in the blood that are then carried through to \nthe urinary tract and excreted. Sometimes waste material is released into the digestive tract  \nand comes out in faeces. Because of this, the digestive tract can also play a role in excretion. \nTheory summary\nThe purpose of the excretory system is to remove excess and unwanted substances from \nthe body and maintain the ideal concentration of water and solutes. The major component \nof the system is the kidneys and the urinary tract. The nephrons of the kidneys filter \nblood and reabsorb the needed materials, and produce urine from the unwanted materials \nand water. Urine travels through the ureters to the bladder, where it is stored until it is \nexcreted out of the body via the urethra. The lungs and skin are also part of the excretory \nsystem as they excrete carbon dioxide and some nitrogenous waste respectively. ureter\u2002 the tube through which \nurine passes from the kidney to the \nbladder\nbladder\u2002 the hollow muscular \norgan that receives urine from the \nkidney and stores it for excretion\nurethra\u2002 the duct through which \nurine is excreted from the bladder \nand out of the body\nlungs\u2002 a pair of organs situated \nwithin the rib cage responsible  \nfor the process of oxygenation  \nand excretion of carbon dioxide  \nin humans\nskin\u2002 the thin layer of tissue \ncovering the outer region of the \nbody of vertebrates\ndigestive tract \u2002the pathway \nof organs that food and liquids \ntravel through after being \nswallowed, leading to digestion \nand elimination.

After all, sleeping \nmeans you don\u2019t drink for ~8 hrs and you lose water via sweat when you \nexercise. Conserving water means more concentrated waste products, \nmaking your urine a darker shade of yellow and more smelly. \nThe distinctive urine smell, though, is not urea \u2013 urea is odourless! It\u2019s \nprobably ammonia (a harsh, chemical smell) and trimethylamine (a fishy \nsmell) \u2013 the breakdown products of urea.

It forms part of the backbone of our DNA as well as the molecule \nadenosine triphosphate (ATP) that captures chemical energy from the food we eat. Phosphorus also plays an important role \nin fertilisers used for growing crops. Because of the green revolution, fertiliser production increased tenfold between 1961 and \n2014. The cheapest way to cope with the rising demands for phosphorus fertiliser was to extract phosphorus from phosphate \nrocks. However, phosphate rocks are a finite and non-renewable resource, meaning the continuous extraction has caused \nconcerns over future supplies. \nThere is one source of phosphorus that is renewable and non-finite: human urine. You excrete up to half a kilogram of \nphosphorus a year in your urine. There are 25 million people living in Australia. That means our country alone could generate \n12.5 million kilograms of phosphorus annually.

Hormones are produced and released by the \nendocrine system and can be transported all over the body via the bloodstream.  \nHormones are integral for life as they allow cells of the body to communicate and  \ninstruct a wide range of processes.

In turn, the adrenal gland secretes the stress hormones adrenaline and \ncortisol. These two stress hormones are released into the bloodstream and cause several changes \nto target cells in the body such as: the expansion of the air passages of the lungs, alter the body\u2019s \nmetabolism to increase blood glucose levels, and increase or decrease blood pressure (which can \nresult in weak knees and heavy arms).\nAdrenaline and cortisol also can cause enlarged pupils, and an increase in heart rate \u2013 increasing the \nbody\u2019s temperature.

Figure 3 shows the structure of a pancreatic islet and some of the major cells found in the \ntissue. Alpha cells produce the hormone glucagon which signals the liver to convert stored glycogen into \nglucose and release it into the bloodstream, raising blood glucose levels. Beta cells produce insulin which \nencourages cells to take in glucose, lowering blood glucose levels. Delta cells produce somatostatin, \nwhich has a number of effects on target cells such as inhibition of hormone secretion and influencing  \nthe activity of the gastrointestinal tract.

Despite several treatment options, more than 600 000 \ndie from the disease annually (Bray et al., 2019). A common misconception is that breast cancer is a single disease, rather it is \na grouping of diseases. Because of this, each different tumour type responds to treatment differently. \nApproximately 70% of breast cancers are dependent on the presence of oestrogen for their growth and survival (Duss et al., \n2019). Currently, endocrine therapy (also known as hormonal therapy) is the most effective treatment against oestrogen-\ndependent tumours. Doctors are able to predict a patient\u2019s response to the endocrine therapy treatment using techniques \ninvolving the use of oestrogen receptors within tumours as biomarkers. However, some oestrogen-dependent tumours can \ndevelop resistance to therapy drugs such as tamoxifen, leaving the predictions inapplicable.\nIt is believed that approximately 40-50% of breast cancer patients do not respond to endocrine therapy, and instead relapse \n(Ma et al., 2009). Non-responders do not benefit from endocrine therapy methods and can potentially suffer from treatment-\nassociated harmful effects.\nAt present, there is uncertainty as to whether methods can accurately predict which oestrogen-dependent tumours will gain \nresistance to endocrine therapy drugs. \nQuestion  8 \nThe hormone in this scenario is\nA oestrogen.\nB tamoxifen.\nQuestion  9 \nThe treatment is called endocrine therapy because\nA the therapy removes all endocrine functioning from the body.\nB it involves altering the effects of a hormone which influences cancer growth.CHapTER  5: BIOLOGIC aL SYSTEMS 228\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

One way that the water \nconcentration of the body is monitored is by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus which detect the concentrations of ions in \nthe extracellular fluid. When a change in the concentration of ions in the blood is detected, such as during exercise, the body \nmust respond. To do so, the hypothalamus produces antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin. ADH is then \ntransported to and released from the pituitary gland, where it travels to several areas of the body including the kidneys. ADH \nfunctions to stimulate the insertion of \u2018water channels\u2019 called aquaporins into the membranes of the kidney tubules, allowing \nfor greater water reabsorption.\na When the hypothalamus detects the change caused by exercise, an increase in the production of ADH occurs.  \nUsing your knowledge of hormones, describe how ADH is transported to the kidneys, and how it stimulates cells  \nof the kidney tubules.\u2002 (2 MARKS)\nb ADH acts on the kidneys, where it regulates the amount of water excreted in the urine.

The pub \nis small and old, and it likely would have gone out of business years ago if it weren\u2019t for Bill\u2019s close-to-daily visits. As Bill \ntook his final steps towards the door, he felt a deep pain high in his back under his ribs. He thought to himself, \u2018Oh well, \nnothing a beer can\u2019t fix\u2019, and wandered in.\nThe following day, Bill was lounging on the couch at home as he made his way through a jumbo meal deal from his local \ntakeaway shop. The pain from yesterday returned but it had become worse. Bill\u2019s daughter Britney entered the room  \nto find her father in pain, exclaiming that it felt like he was being stabbed under the ribs. Britney told her father that  \nshe had learned about the organs of the body in Biology class. She believed that Bill was experiencing pain in his kidneys. \nWhen Bill\u2019s wife Bonnie returned home from the gym, she took Bill to the hospital.\n1 What is the function of kidneys within the body?\u2002 (1 MARK)\n2 Kidneys make up part of the body\u2019s excretory system. List the major structures that are a part of the  \nexcretory system. \u2002(2 MARKS)\nAt the hospital, doctors were quick to note Bill\u2019s symptoms of kidney pain and were concerned about the levels of uric \nacid circulating in his blood. They thought that Bill may be suffering from hyperuricemia, a state of abnormally high blood \nuric acid levels. They decided to run a few tests, but Bill was afraid of needles and only after his wife Bonnie completed \nthe test first, did he take the test.\nBlood uric acid level ranges (mg/L) Bonnie\u2019s result Bill\u2019s result\nGender Male Female 0.033 g/L 0.124 g/L\nRegular range 34\u201370 24\u201360\nHyperuricemia Above 86 Above 71\nThe test results are shown. Unfortunately for Bill and Bonnie, the small town hospital used very old equipment that gave \nresults in grams per litre.\n3 What are Bonnie and Bill\u2019s blood uric acid levels in milligrams per litre?\u2002 (1 MARK)\n4 Do Bonnie and Bill\u2019s readings fall within the regular range, or would they be diagnosed with hyperuricemia? \u2002(2 MARKS)\nThe doctor began to hand Bill several pamphlets of ways to reduce the levels of uric acid in his blood. One was titled  \n\u2018Eat good, feel good\u2019. Bill asked why his diet affects his uric acid levels. The doctors explained that uric acid, and other \nwaste products such as urea, are produced in the body from the food we eat, with most of it being excreted in the  \nurine. Consuming foods that are high in certain nitrogen-containing compounds can lead to increased uric acid levels. \nThese foods include some meats such as bacon, organs, seafood, caffeine, and alcoholic beverages. When the levels \nof uric acid in the blood significantly increase, the kidneys cannot expel the excess uric acid. This can lead to severe \nproblems such as kidney stones, digestive issues, and cardiovascular disease. \n5 When food enters the body, how is it digested? Describe the process by referring to the function of each organ.  \n(4 MARKS)\n6 How does Bill\u2019s diet, largely consisting of fast food, alcohol, and coffee, affect the levels of uric acid in his blood?  \n(1 MARK)\n7 A third major system of tissues and organs within the body is the endocrine system. The endocrine system is \ninvolved in the regulation of uric acid levels as many hormones influence the concentration of urine.

  "Page 245": "The experimental drug\nBonnie asked how long Bill would have to eat healthy like this and the doctors explained that it could take weeks or \nmonths before the kidney pain would disappear. \u2018Months?! I don\u2019t have months. I want this pain gone now. Surely there is \nsome drug that can help me? Give me something that will help my pain go away more quickly!\u2019 cried Bill.\nIn the dirt-poor hospital, there were no short-term solutions to Bill\u2019s hyperuricemia. As doctors tried to calm Bill down, \nan ominous figure wandered past in the hallway. The strange man poked his head in the door and explained that he runs \na pharmaceutical company which is testing pre-market drugs. He claimed to have a solution to Bill\u2019s problem. Bill was \necstatic, but Bonnie was sceptical.\nA visit to the pharmaceutical company did not quell Bonnie\u2019s scepticism. The strange man showed Bill and Bonnie \naround his laboratory, giving them a first-hand look at his company\u2019s newly developed drug Allobillinol, which promised \nto lower uric acid levels in just five days. Bill was also introduced to a group of scientists that wanted to monitor his \nexperience on the new drug. Bonnie was concerned about Bill taking the drug. She asked if the drug had any side effects \nand queried what it was made from. The scientists explained that the drug was 99% plant-based. A species of cress \nflowering plant known as Lepidium billium was used as it had medicinal properties that reduce pain.\n8 Flowering plants have two major organ systems that allow them to grow and metabolise.

Parameters that affect the functioning of cells include: \n\u2022 temperature (your optimal internal body temperature is around 36.5 \u2013 37 .5 \u00b0C)\n\u2022 pH (acidity level) (the optimal pH of the blood is 7 .35 \u2013 7 .45) \n\u2022 blood sugar levels (blood sugar levels are maintained between 4.0 \u2013 7 .8 mmol/L) \n\u2022 sodium and potassium concentration (normal levels are 135 \u2013 145 mmol/L for sodium \nand 3.5 \u2013 5.0 mmol/L for potassium) \n\u2022 fluid balance. \nThe external environment, that is, the world outside our bodies, influences our internal \nenvironment. When you stand outside in a blizzard, the freezing conditions cause your \nbody temperature to drop. Conversely, when you stand outside in the heat your body \ntemperature goes up, you start to sweat, and you lose fluid. All these things alter the \ninternal environment of your body, making things unpleasant for our cells. \nAs you know, however, you can stand outside in the heat for a little while before you  \nstart to feel really uncomfortable. Your cells don\u2019t instantly die when the external \nenvironment of your body changes. Why is that? Because our bodies are constantly \nmaintaining homeostasis .\nHomeostasis is a complex group of regulated processes that occur throughout the body  \nwith the aim of maintaining an internal environment that is just right for our cells.  \nWe\u2019ll now take a general look at how homeostasis is maintained in the body.\nHomeostatic mechanisms \u20021.2.4.2\nOverview\nHomeostatic processes can be explained using the stimulus-response model and  \nfeedback loops.\nTheory  details\nAs described earlier, there are a large number of conditions that need to be controlled \nfor cells to function properly. Because of this, our bodies have developed a number \nof different systems to combat changes in the external environment and maintain a \nconstant internal environment. All of these homeostatic systems can be described using \na stimulus-response model  and positive  and negative  feedback systems . We\u2019ll look at \neach of these now.\nThe stimulus-response model \nThe stimulus-response model (Figure 2) outlines how changes in the external  \nand internal environment can influence an organism\u2019s function. \nThe stimulus-response model can be simplified into five components: \n1 Stimulus  \u2013 a change in the external or internal environment of an organism.\n2 Receptor  \u2013 the stimulus is detected by a receptor in the body which then transfers \nthis stimulus into a chemical or electrical signal for transmission to the modulator. \nThere are many types of receptors. Cell receptors, for example, often come in the form \nof proteins embedded in the membrane or in the cytosol which detect a change in the \nenvironment. In many cases, a whole cell can act as a receptor. \n3 Modulator/s  \u2013 information from the receptors is sent to the modulator. In some \nhomeostatic mechanisms, the modulator is a part of the brain, in others, it is a specific \ntype of cell. The modulator compares the information received from the receptors with \nan ideal condition the body aims to maintain (for example, the set point for temperature \nin the body is 37 \u00b0C). Depending on the result of this, the modulator releases molecules \nthat go on to alter the functioning of an effector. The modulator may also be called the \nprocessing centre.\n4 Effector  \u2013 the effector is a molecule (usually a hormone ), cell, or organ that responds \nto a signal from the modulator and produces a response.\n5 Response  \u2013 the effector initiates the response to the stimulus. The response is any change \nin the function of a target cell, organ, or organism after stimulation from an initial signal.homeostasis\u2002 the maintenance \nof a relatively stable internal \nenvironment in the body \ndespite changes in the external \nenvironment \nstimulus-response model\u2002 a \nmodel that describes how a \nsystem responds to a stimulus \npositive feedback system\u2002 a \nstimulus\u2013response process in \nwhich the response increases  \nthe stimulus \nnegative feedback system\u2002 a \nstimulus\u2013response process in \nwhich the response counters  \nthe stimulus\nstimulus (pl. stimuli)\u2002 an event \nor molecule that can initiate a \nresponse\nreceptor\u2002 a structure that detects \na signal or external change, usually \na protein \nmodulator\u2002 location where \ninformation from receptors is sent \nto and compared to a set point, \nand where molecules altering  \nthe functioning of an effector  \nare released.

The bodies of astronauts experience a number \nof physiological challenges whilst in space, and many of these are to do with homeostasis. One problem concerns the \nhomeostatic process of fluid and blood pressure regulation. \nOn Earth, gravity draws blood and other fluids towards the lower body. In space, however, when gravity is no longer present \nthis fluid tends to collect in the upper body. The redistribution of fluid in the body causes an increase in blood pressure in \nthe head, which can damage the brain. Homeostatic measures counter this by causing a reduction in plasma volume and red \nblood cell production, leading to a 10% decrease in total blood volume. Due to this reduction, upon returning to Earth many \nastronauts suffer from a condition called orthostatic hypotension, in which their blood pressure drops by a significant amount \nwhen they stand up. This can cause them to feel lightheaded, and even pass out due to reduced blood flow to their brain. \nQuestion  8 \nOne example of a homeostatic mechanism that occurs in astronauts in space is \nA an increase in blood pressure. \nB a reduction in the production of red blood cells.\nQuestion  9 \nThe orthostatic hypotension experienced by the astronauts upon their return to Earth is caused by\nA increased gravity in space. \nB a reduction in blood volume. \nC an increase in blood pressure in the brain. \nQuestion  10 \nThe redistribution of blood volume in the body in space is caused by \nA a reduction in gravity. \nB orthostatic hypotension. \nC a loss of fluid from the body. \nD the increase of red blood cell production.\nQuestion  11 \nThe example of reduced blood volume countering the redistribution of fluid in the body of astronauts is an example of \nA a positive feedback loop. \nB a negative feedback loop. \nQuestion  12 \nIn this example of homeostasis, the stimulus is\nA the decrease in blood volume. \nB an increase in brain blood pressure. \nC the redistribution of blood in low gravity. \nQuestion  13 \nOne potential treatment for orthostatic hypotension in astronauts who return from space could be \nA getting astronauts to donate blood to reduce their blood volume. \nB giving astronauts medication to decrease their blood pressure. \nC giving astronauts fluids to increase their blood volume.  \nD keeping them in chambers with increased gravity.

All of these responses are aimed at \nincreasing the amount of heat lost to the environment and decreasing the amount of heat \nproduced by the body.

When you don\u2019t \neat for a long period of time, or you exercise strenuously and use up all your available \nblood glucose, this glycogen is broken down via a process called glycogenolysis  back into \nglucose.

The answer, it shouldn\u2019t surprise you, is\u2026 homeostasis ! \nRegulating blood glucose \u20021.2.4.6\nOverview\nHomeostasis maintains constant blood glucose levels by releasing insulin to lower blood \nglucose levels and glucagon to increase blood glucose levels. The process occurs via \nnegative feedback according to the stimulus-response model. \nTheory  details\nThe stimulus-response model can be used to explain how blood glucose levels are \nregulated in humans via negative feedback loops: \n\u2022 The stimulus is a change in blood glucose levels to above or below approximately  \n5 mmol/L\n\u2022 The receptor in the model is the pancreas , specifically, clusters of specialised cells \ncalled the islets of Langerhans . These islets are comprised of two types of cells \u2013 alpha \ncells  and beta cells  \u2013 and it is these cells that detect blood glucose levels (Figure 4)\n\u2022 The modulator in the regulation of glucose is also the islets of Langerhans.  \nInsulin  or glucagon  is released depending on whether glucose levels are high or low \n\u2022 Insulin and glucagon travel through the bloodstream to alter effectors throughout  \nthe body \n\u2022 The response is an increase/decrease in blood glucose levels to within normal limits. \nThis is summarised in Figure 5.\nalpha cell\nbeta cellgallbladder\nislet of \nLangerhans\npancreaspancreas\nImage: Designua/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 4\u2002 Islets of Langerhans located in the pancreas consist of glucagon-secreting alpha cells and insulin-secreting \nbeta cells. \nSimilar to how we approached thermoregulation in the previous lesson, let\u2019s now look at \nwhat happens in the body when blood glucose levels are too high, and what happens when \nthey become too low. \nWhat happens when blood glucose levels increase?\nWhen an islet of Langerhans detects a blood glucose level above around 5 mmol/L,  \nbeta cells release insulin. Insulin goes on to stimulate two different effectors via two \ndifferent pathways: \n1 Skeletal muscle and fat cells absorb more glucose from the blood. When insulin binds to \nthese cells, glucose transporters are inserted into the cells\u2019 membrane, thus increasing \nthe amount of glucose that can be absorbed by the cell via facilitated diffusion  \n(Figure 6). Glucose transporters are necessary because glucose is hydrophilic and does \nnot readily pass through lipid cell membranes. Once in the cell, this extra glucose can \nbe used by mitochondria to create energy. Additionally, in skeletal muscle cells, some \nof the absorbed glucose gets turned into glycogen for storage. In fat cells, this extra \nglucose is converted into fatty acids for long term storage. \n2 Liver cells are stimulated to convert more glucose into glycogen. The liver already has \na high uptake of glucose and this is unaffected by insulin.

The increase in \nosmolality is detected by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, initiating a pathway \ninvolving the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) . The decrease in blood pressure and \nvolume are detected by baroreceptors in the atria of the heart, the carotid artery in the \nneck, and in the kidneys, which stimulate the release of renin .\nAntidiuretic hormone (ADH) pathway\nFollowing increases in osmolality and detection by osmoreceptors, signals are sent to the \nposterior pituitary gland which causes the release of ADH. ADH has two primary effects. \nFirst \u2013 ADH increases water reabsorption in the nephrons of the kidney by increasing the \nnumber of aquaporins  inserted into the cells of the distal convoluted tubule and collecting \nduct (Figure 7). As this water is reabsorbed back into the body, urine output is reduced \nand it becomes much more concentrated.

Many diuretics alter the homeostatic processes that regulate water balance in  \nthe body.\nIn some sports, athletes use diuretics to gain a competitive advantage. For example, in sports with weight categories such as \nboxing, athletes may use diuretics to lose a large amount of water. The goal is to reduce body weight and be placed in a lower \nbody-weight category. Theoretically, the athletes gain an advantage as their true weight would be greater than others in this \nlower weight category.\nOther athletes sometimes use diuretics to mask the presence of performance-enhancing drugs in their system.

Additionally, the neighbouring  \nalpha cells  are also impaired and can no longer function properly.\nOne of the leading theories is that a person may have an underlying genetic predisposition \nto developing type 1 diabetes, and that exposure to a viral infection of some kind could lead \nto the development of the condition.\nIslets of Langerhans\nNormal islet \nType 1 diabetesbeta cells destroyedalpha cellbeta cellblood vessel\nImage: Alila Medical Media/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 1\u2002 In type 1 diabetes, beta cells in the pancreas are destroyed by autoantibodies.autoimmune disease\u2002 a disease \nin which an individual\u2019s immune \nsystem initiates an immune \nresponse against their own cells\nbeta cells\u2002 cells that occupy  \nthe islets of Langerhans and  \nsecrete insulin\nautoantibodies\u2002 proteins created \nby the immune system that \ndestroy an organism\u2019s own tissues \nalpha cells\u2002 cells that secrete the \nhormone glucagon\nBeta cells are responsible  \nfor the production of insulin \nand the uptake of glucose.  \nIf your knowledge of glucose \nregulation has gluca-gone from \nyour memory, it\u2019s probably \nbest to revise lesson 6C  before \ncontinuing or else things might \nget a little confusing.\nTYPE 2 DIABETES\nAnother form of diabetes, called type 2 diabetes , also exists.

It typically occurs later in life, usually beginning around \nmiddle to older age.

In the short term, this \ncan cause a number of symptoms including:\n\u2022 increased urination and excessive thirst \u2013 if levels of glucose in the blood are high, \nglucose can push through the walls of the glomerulus and end up in the kidney filtrate. \nThe presence of glucose in the filtrate increases its osmolality, meaning that the normal \nosmotic processes that reabsorb water in the nephron don\u2019t function properly. As a \nresult, water remains in the filtrate and a larger amount of dilute urine is produced \n(Figure 3). This can cause a person with type 1 diabetes to lose large amounts of water, \nbecome dehydrated, and feel thirsty\n\u2022 excessive hunger and lethargy \u2013 because their cells aren\u2019t receiving the glucose they \nneed to function properly, people with type 1 diabetes often feel tired and lethargic.  \nIn an attempt to correct the lack of glucose entering the system, the body stimulates  \nthe sensation of hunger\n\u2022 weight loss \u2013 the loss of large amounts of water and the inability of cells to grow  \nand function normally due to a lack of glucose can lead to weight loss in people with \ntype 1 diabetes.\nImage: Alexander Raths/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 3\u2002 Back in the \u2018good old days\u2019 doctors used to have to taste people\u2019s urine to see if it contained glucose.  \nAn English doctor named Thomas Willis once wrote in 1674 that the urine of a person with diabetes was \u2018wonderfully \nsweet as if it were imbued with honey or sugar.\u2019 Fortunately nowadays a dipstick test can be used instead.\nHyperglycaemia can also have many long term consequences.

People with type \n1 diabetes can become hypoglycaemic if they inject too much insulin, or if they exercise \ntoo much or don\u2019t consume enough glucose. In addition, because their alpha cells are \nimpaired, people with type 1 diabetes don\u2019t produce normal levels of glucagon, meaning \nthat they do not produce normal amounts of glucose via glycogenolysis in periods of \nfasting and their blood glucose level continues to fall.\nHypoglycaemia is a very dangerous condition. Without enough glucose, cells don\u2019t have \nenough energy to function. This can cause the individual to feel weak and dizzy, and  \ncan even result in them losing consciousness or dying if glucose levels aren\u2019t corrected \nquickly (Figure 5).\nManagement of type 1 diabetes\nManagement of type 1 diabetes involves returning the patient\u2019s insulin levels, and \ntherefore their blood glucose levels, back to normal and maintaining them within their \nhomeostatic set points. The main way this is done is through insulin replacement therapy.\nInsulin replacement therapy involves diabetic patients artificially altering their insulin \nlevels to regulate their blood glucose levels. One way this can be done is by having patients \nmeasure their blood glucose levels via a finger prick test. If they are hyperglycaemic the \npatient calculates the amount of artificial insulin they need to inject themselves with to \nensure normal homeostatic glucose regulation (Figure 6).\nThere are many different types of artificial insulin available, and each works differently \u2013 \nsome are said to be long-acting, ensuring consistent glucose uptake by cells over extended \nperiods of time (typically about 24 hours); while others are short-acting, and begin \nworking in the body very quickly after injection, resulting in high amounts of glucose \nbeing transported into cells over a relatively short period of time (usually between 5 \u2013 8 \nhours). Typically, a person with type 1 diabetes will use both short- and long-acting insulin \nto maintain their blood glucose levels over the course of a day.\nAlternatively, the levels of insulin can be managed by an insulin pump. This involves a \nsensor being placed under the skin that constantly monitors the blood glucose level of the \npatient. When levels rise above normal, the pump automatically injects the appropriate \namount of insulin to return blood glucose levels back to normal (Figure 7).\nHyperthyroidism \u20021.2.5.2\nOverview\nHyperthyroidism is a condition caused by an overactive thyroid gland.

Individuals are diagnosed with hyperthyroidism via a blood test \u2013 people with \nhyperthyroidism will have elevated T3 and T4 levels in their blood, as well as reduced \nlevels of TSH (the increased levels of thyroid hormones inhibit the secretion of TSH via \nnegative feedback, as shown in Figure 8).\nThere are a number of different causes of hyperthyroidism. One of the most common \ncauses is an autoimmune disease called Graves\u2019 disease . The immune system of \npeople with Graves\u2019 disease produces an autoantibody called thyroid-stimulating \nimmunoglobulin (TSI) . This antibody recognises and binds to the TSH receptors on the \nthyroid, stimulating the thyroid to release T3 and T4. As such, people with Graves\u2019 disease \nhave elevated levels of thyroid hormones as their thyroids are constantly being stimulated \nto release hormones (Figure 9).\nTSH\nTSH receptorNormal thyroid function Thyroid function with Graves\u2019 disease\nthyroid cell thyroid cell\nregulated production\nand secretion of \nthyroid hormonesunregulated production\nand secretion of \nthyroid hormonesautoantibody\nTSH receptor\nnegative \nfeedbackpituitary\ngland\nImage: Alila Medical Media/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 9\u2002 In people with Graves\u2019 disease, an antibody binds to the TSH receptor and stimulates the thyroid gland to \nsecrete hormones.\nSymptoms of hyperthyroidism\nBecause thyroid hormones influence a variety of cells in the body, the symptoms of \nhyperthyroidism are many and varied.

  "Page 297": "Management of hyperthyroidism\nThere are a number of different approaches to managing hyperthyroidism depending on \nthe cause. Some treatments aim to counteract the effects of increased hormones levels \u2013 \nfor example, drugs like beta-blockers can be administered to reduce heart rate.  \nOther medications called antithyroid drugs reduce the production of thyroid hormones.\nRadioactive iodine is sometimes given to people with hyperthyroidism. Iodine is a key \ningredient in the production of thyroid hormones, and is absorbed only by cells in the \nthyroid gland. By absorbing radioactive iodine, these cells are killed, reducing the amount \nof thyroid hormone produced and secreted. The most radical treatment option is surgical \nremoval of the thyroid gland.\nSome treatments for hyperthyroidism can result in hypothyroidism. To counter this, \npatients may need to take artificial thyroid hormones to increase their levels to within \nnormal limits. \nTheory summary\nDiseases can arise when the processes of homeostasis malfunction. Type 1 diabetes \noccurs when the body\u2019s immune system destroys insulin-secreting beta cells in the \npancreas, preventing the normal regulation of glucose. Hyperthyroidism occurs when the \nfunctioning of the thyroid gland becomes deregulated and produces excess amounts of \nthyroid hormones. Hyp erthyroidism makes things \nfaster, whilst hyp othyroidism \nmakes things go sl ow!\nWhen a person with diabetes is hypoglycaemic, they need to quickly raise their blood glucose levels \nbefore they lose consciousness. This is where the humble jelly bean swoops in and saves the day. \nWith their high sugar content, jelly beans can be used to quickly boost the blood glucose levels of \nthese patients to within normal limits. So sure, whilst black beans and butter beans are \u2018healthier\u2019 for \nyou, remember that there\u2019s only ONE member of the bean family who can save lives.HYPOTHYROIDISM\nIn addition to secreting an excess of thyroid hormones, sometimes disease can occur when the thyroid \nproduces reduced levels of hormones. This condition is called hypothyroidism , and results in \u2018the \nopposite\u2019 symptoms. Where in hyperthyroidism the body \u2018speeds up\u2019, in hypothyroidism the body \u2018slows \ndown\u2019, resulting in symptoms such as weight gain, reduced energy levels, feeling cold, and poor memory \nand attention. The most common cause of hypothyroidism is iodine deficiency. Iodine is an important \ncomponent of thyroid hormones, so if not enough iodine is consumed the levels of thyroid hormones \ndrop. In a bid to increase the amount of iodine consumed in the diet, many foods such as table salt and \nbread have iodine added to them (Figure 11).\nImage: digitalreflections/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 11\u2002 It doesn\u2019t taste as good as chicken salt on chips, but iodised salt provides your body with the iodine \nit needs to synthesise thyroid hormones.hypothyroidism\u2002 a condition \nin which the thyroid gland is \nunderactive, resulting in  \ndecreased production and \nsecretion of thyroid hormonesCHapTer 6: Homeos Tasis 286\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

This is where we demonstrate the \ncreative capabilities that are inherent to the key science skills (KSSs), which we learnt \nabout in chapter 1. This stage involves several individual steps, from deciding on a research \nquestion, to defining relevant concepts and theory, and finally considering different \ntechniques for generating data.

As you work through this assessment,  \nrevisit these checklists to make sure you are including all of the required information at \neach stage. \nFor this section of your investigation you need to include discussion of each of the following:\n\u2022 the biological science concepts specific to the selected scientific investigation and their \nsignificance, including the definition of key terms\n\u2022 the scientific methodology relevant to the selected scientific investigation, selected \nfrom: classification and identification; controlled experiment; correlational study; \nfieldwork; modelling; product, process or system development; or simulation\n\u2022 techniques of primary qualitative and quantitative data generation relevant to the \ninvestigation\n\u2022 the accuracy, precision, reproducibility, repeatability, and validity of measurements in \nrelation to the investigation\n\u2022 the health, safety, and ethical guidelines relevant to the selected scientific investigation.\nStep 1: Develop a research question \nAs mentioned, this task requires you to design your own scientific investigation in order \nto explore something you have learnt over Unit 1, specifically in regards to the functioning \nand/or regulation of cells and systems. Before you start, you must think of a research \nquestion you want to explore. \nTo do this, think back to the theory you\u2019ve learned throughout the first 6 chapters of \nthis textbook. Is there anything you enjoyed that you\u2019d like to explore in more detail? \nWas there something that you learned that you thought was really interesting?

  "Page 314": "COME UP WITH A RESEARCH QUESTION\nHere in the Biology Team at Edrolo, we\u2019ve had a problem over the past year. We\u2019ve been trying to grow \nsome nice indoor plants on our desks at Edrolo headquarters, however, no matter what we do they \nalways seem to shrivel up and die. What makes things worse is that we can look over at the Psychology \nTeam and see some indoor plants on their desks, and theirs are thriving. As the supposed experts on all \nthings living, you can imagine this is quite embarrassing for us. \nWe noticed that Team Psych\u2019s desks were right in front of the office windows and that their plants were \nreceiving a lot more direct sunlight than ours. We were reminded that plants get their energy from \nphotosynthesis, a process that requires sunlight, and believed this to be the reason for our miserable \nplant growth. We wondered whether sunlight affects indoor plant growth, and if so, to what extent. \nTo formulate a testable, achievable, and specific research question, we identified the type of plant we \nwanted to grow in the office, and came up with the following research question: \n\u2018Does the growth of an indoor mini fiddle-leaf fig ( Ficus lyrata bambino ) increase when exposed to \nmore sunlight?\u2019\nStep 2: Understand the biological concepts behind the  \nresearch question\nAn important part of designing your investigation is to clearly define the scope of your \narea of study by discussing any key biological concepts that are relevant to your research \nquestion. This is both for your benefit, and that of your reader. From your point of view, \nnot only does it demonstrate that you\u2019ve been paying attention in class, but defining key \nconcepts also helps you better understand what is important to investigate, and what \ngoes beyond your chosen research question. In other words, it helps you more effectively \nanalyse the data you obtain, and decide what should be included in your final assessment. \nFor your reader, on the other hand, who may not be as familiar as you with the chosen area \nof research, defining key terms and explaining the biological concepts that underpin your \nresearch will help them engage with and better understand your investigation. \nStart by defining key terms in your research question, and then take a few sentences to \nsummarise the most important concepts behind the question. So, for example, if your \nresearch question relates to malfunctions in homeostasis, some concepts you might \nwant to explain in your introduction might include: (1) what homeostasis is and why it\u2019s \nimportant, (2) what regular homeostasis looks like, and (3) an explanation of different \nfactors that influence homeostasis. This is to get your reader \u2018up-to-speed\u2019, so to speak, \nand to set up the rest of your investigation to be able to explore something new.\nYou might decide to leverage information from other parts of the textbook, or even from previous studies. \n\u2018Previous research has demonstrated that healthy office plants increase average employee morale in a \nworkplace setting (Larson et al. 1998). It is therefore important to understand the conditions in which \nindoor office plants flourish and grow. The mini fiddle-leaf fig ( Ficus lyrata bambino ) is a plant native to \nAfrica that is widely used as an office plant in Australia. It is photosynthetic, meaning it uses energy from \nsunlight and turns it into usable chemical energy. The current understanding is that F. lyrata bambino  \ngrows best under indirect natural sunlight. This research hopes to determine at what distance from direct \nsunlight is best for vertical growth in the plant species.\u2019\nStep 3: Select the appropriate methodology and define your variables \nNow that you\u2019ve got your research question, it\u2019s time to figure out how to actually get to \nthe answer by conducting a scientific investigation! This will require you to select the \nappropriate scientific methodology, which will help you in designing your specific method \n(the actual steps in your experiment). What is the best way to answer your research \nquestion? Is laboratory work and a controlled experiment going to give you the data you \nneed to support or disprove your hypothesis? Or do you need to do fieldwork or modelling \nto get the information you need? It may be helpful to look back at lesson 1A again to \nrefamiliarise yourself with the different scientific methodology types, and their strengths \nand weaknesses.\nTHEORY303\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

An important part of this methodology is \ndefining the variables in your experiment. This is especially true of controlled experiments, \nwhich help us understand cause and effect by investigating the impact of an independent \nvariable (IV) on a dependent variable (DV) whilst keeping all other variables constant \n(controlled variables). Make sure to clearly state each variable in your investigation.  \nTo remind you, the variable that is being affected is the dependent variable (DV), while the \nvariable that is being manipulated is the independent variable (IV). For example, we might \ninvestigate the impact of changing temperature (IV) on the rate of oxygen production from \nphotosynthesis in plant X (DV). Here, we would set up an experiment where different \nspecimens are exposed to different temperatures whilst ensuring that all other variables are \nthe same (such as UV exposure, water exposure, air pressure etc.)\nBecause we are examining the impact of a single variable on another, we decided the best methodology \nto follow was a controlled experiment. We could have instead conducted fieldwork and observed plants \noutside, perhaps comparing the growth of plants in sunny patches with the growth of plants in shady \nspots. However, this method would have introduced a number of confounding variables that we couldn\u2019t \ncontrol. Given that we wanted to be certain of the influence of light on plant growth, we decided to \nconduct a controlled experiment. It is important to discuss the reason for this decision in your  \nfinal presentation. \nWe also defined our variables: \n\u2022 Independent variable (the thing we were going to change)  = the amount of sunlight our plants were \nexposed to.\n\u2022 Dependent variable (the thing that we were going to measure)  = the amount of plant growth. \n\u2022 Controlled variables (things we need to keep constant during our investigation)  = other factors that \ninfluence photosynthesis and plant growth, including water exposure, any fertilisers used, soil quality, \nand temperature. \nNote that it is also important to define any units of measurement when describing your variables.  \nWe will return to this point in the communication section of this guide. We measure the amount of \nsunlight as (none, 10 m away, direct sunlight) while we measure the growth of the plant as height in \nmillimetres (mm).\nBased on our knowledge about plants and photosynthesis, we made the following hypothesis:\n\u2018The growth of a mini fiddle-leaf fig will increase when exposed to more sunlight.\u2019Step 4: State your hypothesis \nYour hypothesis is a testable statement that predicts how your independent variable will \naffect your dependent variable. Based on your knowledge of the topic and your research, \nyou should be able to come up with an idea of how altering your independent variable \nwill influence your dependent variable. At the end of your experiment, the results you \nobtain will either be as you expected and support your hypothesis, or differ from what you \nexpected and refute your hypothesis.How to conduct a practical investigation 304\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

If you\u2019ve chosen to do a controlled experiment, consider the following  \nkey components: \n1 What will you be measuring in your experiment and how will you be measuring it?  \nThis includes how long your experiment will run for and how big your sample is. \n2 What different conditions are you going to have in your experiment? How will you \ndesign your experimental groups to ensure these conditions are tested?   \n3 How will you be controlling for uncontrolled variables to ensure they don\u2019t impact your \nresults?

Or, at the very least, how will you conduct \nyour experiment so that their influence on your result is minimal? \n6 What is the best way to generate a sample? \n7 What ethical and safety guidelines do you need to be aware of before conducting  \nyour investigation? \nOnce you\u2019ve addressed each of these questions, you can use your answers to help write \nyour method. Use our example as inspiration for how to construct your method.If you\u2019ve decided to use a \ndifferent methodology, turn \nback to lesson 1A  to see what \nthings you need to consider \nwhen designing  \nyour experiment. \nDESIGN YOUR EXPERIMENT\nWe answered the above questions as shown:\n1 We will be measuring vertical plant growth using a tape measure to measure how high the plants are, \nfrom the surface of the soil to their stem tip, after two weeks of growth. We will have fifteen plants in \ntotal, with five plants exposed to each light condition. \n2 We are going to manipulate our independent variable by having a variety of different light conditions \u2013  \nsome plants will be placed in a cupboard and receive no light (Group A), some will be placed ten \nmetres away from a window (Group B), and others will be placed directly in front of a window (Group \nC). Group A will serve as our control group.\n3 We identified relevant controlled variables. For example, (1) we will ensure that the plants receive the \nsame amount of watering, (2) they will be watered at the same time of day, (3) we will not provide \nany of the plants with fertiliser, and (4) we will ensure that all the plants are the same species and are \nof similar size and health.\n4 As mentioned, there are five plants exposed to each light condition. This means we have five \nreplicates per each light condition. \n5 We will use the same tape measure and have the same person measuring all the plants. We will \nensure the tape measure has clear 1 mm markings. \n6 We will select plants at random from a pool of plants that are all of similar size and health and place \nthem randomly into each light condition group. \n7 Fortunately, we feel our investigation is quite safe. However, we do need to be careful to check \nif anyone is allergic to the plant we have chosen. We know that the sap of Ficus lyrata bambino  is \nirritating to skin so we will need to provide our team with personal protective equipment (PPE) such \nas gloves to use while handling the plants. \nUsing these answers, we designed the following methodology for our scientific investigation. Note that \nnot each question needs to correspond to a step in your methodology.  \n1 Randomly select 15 Ficus lyrata bambino  plants of similar height and size. \n2 Divide these plants into three groups \u2013 Group A, Group B, and Group C \u2013 and assign each plant a \nnumber within each group \u2013 e.g. plants A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 are all in Group A, while plants B1\u2013B5 \nare in Group B, and the same for Group C. \n3 Measure the height from soil level to the tip of the stem of each plant using a tape measure and \nrecord these measurements. Ensure gloves are worn to protect from the plant\u2019s sap.\n4 Water each plant with 20 mL of tap water. \n5 Place all the plants from Group A into a cupboard with the door closed so they are in darkness,  \nplace the Group B plants on a table 10 metres away from a north-facing window, and place the  \nGroup C plants on a table directly in front of the same north-facing window. \n6 After two weeks, have the same person measure and record the heights of each plant.\nTHEORY305\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",
  "Page 317": "Step 6: Considering internal measures \nThe final step in designing your investigation is to consider the relevance of certain \ninternal measures that are important for completing scientific investigations. It is \nimportant to think about how well your investigation satisfies these measures at the start \nof your process, prior to conducting your investigation, as well as at the end of the process, \nonce you get back your results. We will remind you of some of these now, and invite you \nto return to these when it is time to present your findings. It is also encouraged to discuss \nthese early in the piece, especially in your logbook, to demonstrate your preparedness to \nyour teacher.\n1 Accuracy: refers to how close your results are to the \u2018true\u2019 value of the quantity being \nmeasured. For example, if we know that plant species X typically photosynthesises \noptimally at a temperature of 35 \u00b0C, then we would expect our primary data to be as \nclose to this value as possible (Figure 2).\n2 Precision: refers to how close your results are to each other. Precise results indicate that \nyour method is valid and reliable, and that you may be able to assume the same results \nwould be found in a larger sample. If you get a wide spread of values across replicates, \nthen results are imprecise. If replicates get similar results, your results are precise.  \nFor example, we would hope that each time we conducted the experiment, each \nreplicate would be around the same value so as to indicate that our method is reliable. \n3 Reproducibility: refers to how reproducible your results are. A reproducible experiment \nmeans that other scientists could follow your method and get the same results over \nand over again. For example, if another group of your classmates were given your \nmethodology and asked to reproduce your experiment, they would be able to get the \nsame results.\n4 Repeatability: refers to how repeatable your results are. A repeatable experiment means \nthat you personally could repeat your experiment and get the same results over and \nover again. In other words, if you did the exact same method again, you would get the \nsame results each time. \n5 Validity: refers to how valid your experimental design is. A valid experiment actually \nmeasures what it claims to be measuring. For example, if we are aiming to measure  \nthe effect of different temperatures on the photosynthesis rate of plant species X,  \nthen that is what we should measure, rather than looking at UV exposure, or different \nplant species. \nLow accuracy\nLow precisionLow accuracy\nHigh precisionHigh accuracy\nLow precisionHigh accuracy\nHigh precision\nFigure 2\u2002 Accurate results are close to the true value, whereas precise results have very little spread around the  \nmean value.\nWhen discussing these internal measures, it is also important to identify any health, safety, \nand/or ethical guidelines that might be relevant to your selected investigation. This might \ninclude things like the sterilisation of your work station, the safe storage of equipment \nand materials, the storage of data and information about participants, obtaining informed \nconsent and/or any other relevant considerations you think it might be important \nto mention. This can also be a good opportunity to introduce some of the bioethical \nconcepts and approaches that were introduced in lesson 1B, and is a great opportunity to \ndemonstrate to your teacher a full and considered investigation design.\nStage 2: Scientific evidence \nStage overview\nHaving followed the steps perfectly and designed a beautiful scientific investigation, it\u2019s \nnow time to collect some scientific evidence to answer your research question.

  "Page 318": "Stage checklist\nFor this section of your investigation you need to discuss and include each of the following:\n\u2022 the distinction between an aim, a hypothesis, a model, a theory, and a law\n\u2022 observations and investigations that are consistent with, or challenge, current scientific \nmodels or theories\n\u2022 the characteristics of primary data\n\u2022 ways of organising, analysing, and evaluating generated primary data to identify \npatterns and relationships including sources of error\n\u2022 use of a logbook to authenticate generated primary data\n\u2022 the limitations of investigation methodologies and methods, and of data generation \nand/or analysis.\nStep 1: Establish a logbook \nBefore doing anything, it is important to set up a logbook that can be used while \nresearching and collecting data. This helps you to look back on your research and identify \nthe sources you have used. It also gives you a good place to record all of your results and \nwrite down any interesting findings/thoughts you have along the way. There is no set \nformat for using a logbook, so it is important to identify what works well for you.  \nYou could take handwritten notes, or type up your research with links.\nTake a look at what the VCAA has to say about the use of a logbook:\nTHE VCAA ON LOGBOOKS\nThe use of a logbook reflects standard scientific practice. Students undertaking this study must maintain \na logbook of practical activities in each of Units 1 to 4 for recording, authentication, and assessment \npurposes. All items in the logbook must be dated and clearly documented.\nThe logbook is submitted as a requirement for satisfactory completion in each of Units 1 to 4. Teachers \nmust regularly sight and monitor the logbook, particularly for the student-designed practical and/ or \nresearch investigations in Outcome 3 of Units 1 and 2, and Outcome 3 of Unit 4.\nThe logbook may be maintained in hard copy or electronic form. However, to avoid falsification and/ or \nalteration of results, for assessment tasks it is recommended that students maintain a hard copy, as is \ncommonly the practice in scientific research.\nStep 2: Collect your data \nIt is important that you find a reliable, clear, and valid way to collect and record your data \nwhile conducting your experiment. Be sure to note down all the results you obtain in your \nlogbook, even if they seem strange or odd. Additionally, it is important to record anything \n\u2018out of the ordinary\u2019 that happened while conducting your experiment \u2013 these events may \ninfluence your results, so you need to be aware of what they were and when they occurred. \nWhen collecting your data, and later presenting it in your final presentation, it is also \nimportant to briefly demonstrate an understanding of the different types of evidence. In this \ninvestigation, you are being asked to generate appropriate qualitative and/or quantitative \ndata. Make sure you clearly distinguish between these, and explain your decision for \nchoosing the data type you did. To briefly remind you, quantitative data is relating to \nquantities, where we look at measures, counts and units. Qualitative data describes qualities, \nand is often in narrative form through interviews, observations, and descriptions.\nFinally, it\u2019s important to make it clear that not all evidence is created equally. When we \nthink of strong scientific evidence, we are typically referring to primary and/or secondary \ndata that is empirical and measurable, and under the control of a formal research \nenvironment. Some scientific evidence might be stronger than others \u2013 for example, a \ncontrolled clinical trial with a large and randomised sample is considered stronger than \na case study that uses a small sample. It is important to identify the strength of your own \nstudy in terms of sample size, and how representative it might be of a wider population  \nor subset. \nTHEORY307\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

The effect of different amounts of sunlight on Ficus lyrata bambino , a popular office \nplant, was studied. Three groups of plants were each exposed to one of three different light conditions \n\u2013 full sunlight, a moderate amount of sunlight, and no sunlight at all. The plants in full sun grew far more \nin the space of two weeks than the other two groups. These results suggest that office plant placement \nshould consider available sunlight to ensure optimal plant growth and therefore maximum benefit  \nto workers. Abstract \nAn abstract is a short summary of your investigation that helps garner the attention and \ninterest of your reader. The VCAA says it isn\u2019t compulsory to have an abstract, but it can be \na good idea as it gives your audience a quick snapshot of what your report is about.

Why do your results matter? Why should anyone care about what \nyou did? For example, our research question was to help us grow better office plants. \nThink back to why you were interested in the research, and go from there. \nLinking your explanation to prior research is a good idea as it shows that you have thought \nabout your investigation in the wider context of biology as a whole, and can prove that \nyour investigation and findings are important. Based on your research, you might also be \nable to point out flaws with previous investigations that suggest your research is important \nand relevant.\nThere should be no doubt after reading your introduction that your investigation is one \nof the most important pieces of research that has ever been done\u2026 just like our study into \noptimal office plant growth which will change the way office plants are configured for the \nrest of time!\nBackground biological concepts \nWe mentioned in the investigation stage the importance of discussing background \nbiological concepts relevant to your research. The introduction is likely where you will \nput it. Introduce the key aspects of theory from the course to demonstrate the relevance of \nyour question to VCE Biology.\nOne way to think about which aspects of theory should be included is to think back \nto when you were designing your experiment \u2013 what aspects of theory did you use to \nformulate your hypothesis? Introduce these to your audience and link them to your \nresearch so that they can understand the biological theories and concepts relevant to  \nyour investigation.EXPLANATION OR REASON FOR UNDERTAKING THE INVESTIGATION\nIt is well understood that having indoor plants in an office space increases employees\u2019 mood and \nperceived comfort levels whilst at work (Larsen et al., 1998) . Perhaps more importantly, however, it has \nalso been shown that an increased number of plants in the workplace decreases worker stress and \nreduces the amount of sick leave taken (Bringslimark et al., 2007 ). As such, it is important to understand \nthe conditions in which indoor office plants flourish and grow.\nBACKGROUND BIOLOGICAL CONCEPTS \nOne key environmental factor that influences plant growth is the amount of light that plants are exposed \nto. This is because plant cells obtain the glucose they use for cellular respiration via a process known as \nphotosynthesis. In photosynthesis, plant cells utilise light energy to transform carbon dioxide and water \ninto glucose, oxygen, and water. The simplified formula for photosynthesis is as follows:\nC6H12O6 + 6 O2 Light\nChlorophyll6 CO2 + 6 H2OHow to conduct a practical investigation 310\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

Given the importance of light in the process of photosynthesis, it is hypothesised that increased \namounts of sunlight exposure will cause plants to grow more compared to plants that are exposed to less \nsunlight or no sunlight at all. \nMATERIALS\nFor this investigation, we used 15 healthy Ficus lyrata bambino  plants selected at random from a  \nlarger population, a tape measure with millimetre markings, gloves, safety goggles, a cupboard and a \nwatering jug.Aim and hypothesis \nAfter you\u2019ve justified the reason for your investigation and provided the background \ninformation required to understand what you\u2019ve explored, you can now introduce the aim \nof your investigation and the hypothesis you generated prior to commencing it. When you \nstate your aim you can also introduce what the independent and dependent variables are, \nand your hypothesis will show the relationship you expected there to be between the two \nbefore you started your investigation. Note the emphasis on before \u2013 you should not be \nchanging your aim or hypothesis once you\u2019ve started.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that everything in your introduction is usually written in \nthe present or future tense. This is because when you are presenting your investigation \nto an audience you are \u2018walking them through\u2019 what you did and found \u2013 as if you are \nconducting your whole investigation again but this time with them tagging along beside \nyou.

Importantly, though, do not interpret or explain these results yet \u2013 this is \nsaved for the next section of the report. You are only presenting your data here as a way to \nhighlight trends or patterns for your reader later in the discussion.\nTo do this effectively, the data that you present in your results section should be \ntransformed \u2013 you should not be presenting raw data in your report. In order to figure \nout how to transform your data, think back to your research question \u2013 what do you need \nto know in order to answer it?

Each \nplant was assigned a number within each group (e.g. Group A consisted of plants A1, A2, A3, A4, and \nA5). We then had one person measure the height of all the Ficus lyrata bambino  from the surface of the \nsoil to their stem tip using the tape measure. Given that the sap of F. lyrata bambino  is a known irritant, \nwe ensured that the measurer was wearing gloves and eye protection at all times. \nOnce the heights of all the plants had been measured and recorded, each plant was watered with 20 mL \nof tap water. All Group A plants were then placed in a cupboard with the door closed, all Group B plants \nwere placed on a table 10 metres away from a north-facing window, and all Group C plants were placed \non a table directly in front of the same north-facing window. \nThe plants were left in their respective positions for two weeks.

In this first section, you want to restate your hypothesis, and suggest whether \nthe data you\u2019ve obtained supports or refutes your hypothesis. To do this, it is important to \ndemonstrate discussion of the following: \nAnalysis \nTo analyse data you must compare the purpose of your investigation with the type of data \nyou obtained \u2013 what is your research question and what type of data is needed to arrive \nat a meaningful conclusion? Assuming you designed your investigation effectively, the \ndata you source should be able to lend itself well to the research question at hand. Keep \nin mind that you are being asked to create quantitative primary data. While other data \n(and other sources) may be leveraged to assist in answering the question, it is important to \ndiscuss the different types of data in your investigation and analyse which is most suited to \nanswering your question. For instance, if my question relates to the optimal temperature \nfor photosynthesis in plant species X, the most effective data is likely to be primary \nmeasurements taken during my experiment of photosynthetic outputs from my sample.\nTHEORY313\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",
  "Page 325": "Linking of results to relevant biological concepts \nIn your introduction, you should have discussed the biological concept/s that are relevant \nto your investigation. It is important to raise these again in your discussion and use them \nto explain why you obtained the results that you recorded. This is called cross\u2013referencing \nyour results against relevant biological concepts. If you\u2019ve done research on previous \nstudies that are similar to your own and your findings support or differ from them, it is \nalso a good idea to comment on this here. Evaluation \nTo evaluate the data you will judge the strength and limitations of your research based on \nthe internal measures you considered earlier in this guide, as well as looking for any errors \nor uncertainties in both your method and the data you collect. Uncertainty might arise if \nthe experiment is not repeatable, reproducible, or valid, or if you use other research that \nhas not been peer-reviewed. Make sure to familiarise yourself with this terminology and \nuse it throughout your final investigation.\nSome common errors include: \n\u2022 personal errors \u2013 mistakes made by the experimenter, such as counting incorrectly, \nrounding to the wrong decimal place, or labelling samples incorrectly\n\u2022 systematic errors \u2013 affect the accuracy of the findings and occur when results differ \nfrom the true value by a consistent amount each time, typically due to faulty equipment \nor calibration \n\u2022 random errors \u2013 affect the precision of the findings and are caused by unpredictable \nvariations in the measurement process. \nSome common types of bias include: \n\u2022 confirmation bias \u2013 the tendency for researchers to only include information that \nsupports their hypothesis or aim\n\u2022 selection bias \u2013 the selection of participants is not randomised and the sample isn\u2019t \nrepresentative of the wider population \n\u2022 publication bias \u2013 when the outcome of a study determines whether it is published or \nnot. Typically, journals only publish studies with \u2018positive\u2019 findings, and often fail to \npublish studies that report a negative result.\nANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF PRIMARY DATA \nIt was hypothesised that increased sunlight exposure would result in increased plant growth. The results \nof this investigation support this hypothesis, with plants in Group C growing significantly more, relative \nto their original height, compared to plants in Groups B and A. Additionally, plants in Group B that were \nexposed to some sunlight grew more than plants in Group A that were not exposed to any sunlight.\nIDENTIFICATION OF OUTLIERS\nPlant C1 did not grow as much as the other plants in Group C. This may be because, unlike all the other \nplants, plant C1 was knocked over during the experiment, resulting in all the soil and the plant itself \nfalling out of the pot. This introduced an uncontrolled variable into the experiment, making it hard to \ncompare the results obtained from plant C1 with the results of all the other plants. As a consequence, the \nresults from plant C1 are no longer useful for answering the research question and have therefore been \nexcluded from analysis in this investigation. Identification of outliers\nPart of evaluating your data is identifying any outliers. If you noticed that any of your \nresults appeared to be outliers, then you should comment on this in your discussion. If \nyou chose to disregard these values during your analysis, make sure you state this clearly. \nAlternatively, if these outliers are still included in your analysis make sure your reader is \naware that there are outliers that may alter the validity of your findings.

  "Page 326": "LINKING OF RESULTS TO RELEVANT BIOLOGICAL CONCEPTS\nGiven the importance of light in the process of photosynthesis, it is unsurprising that plants that are \nexposed to higher amounts of sunlight grew more in our investigation. It seems that the extra energy \nthey were able to generate enabled their cells to grow and replicate at a greater rate compared to plants \nthat were kept in darkness, resulting in greater growth during the recorded period of time.\nIDENTIFICATION OF LIMITATIONS IN DATA AND METHODS AND SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS \nIt is important to note that a number of factors may have influenced our result in this investigation.  \nFor example, the tape measure that was used, whilst having 1 mm markings, may not have been the most \nprecise measuring tool available. As such, it may have introduced an element of random or personal \nerror into our results, given the added difficulty of accurately measuring the plants. For future research, it \nwould be advisable to use a more accurate measuring device, such as a laser measure or digital calipers, \nto get more exact measurements. \nAdditionally, plant height may not be the best way to measure the effect of increased photosynthesis \non plants. Plants have extensive root systems, and it may have been that the plants that didn\u2019t grow \nas much vertically grew more roots instead. Additionally, plants may have been growing outwards \nrather than upwards, or, the stems of the plants may have been increasing in diameter. A different way \nof measuring the plants, perhaps one based on weight instead of height, may give a more accurate \nunderstanding as to the effect of sunlight exposure on plant growth. Furthermore, only one species of \nplant was studied in this investigation. It is possible that other types of plants may respond differently to \ndifferent amounts of light. \nDespite these limitations, the clear trend in our results suggests that exposing Ficus lyrata bambino  to \nmore sunlight does indeed increase its growth, and therefore we suggest it would also increase the \ngrowth of other types of office plants.Identification of limitations in data and methods, and suggested improvements \nAfter you\u2019ve claimed whether your results support the hypothesis, it\u2019s important to take \na step back and evaluate whether or not your results are reliable and can be trusted. \nConsider if the method was flawed and, if so, whether extraneous or uncontrolled \nvariables may have impacted the results. Can you think of any errors that may have \noccurred during the investigation? If so, what were they? This is part of the evaluation \nstage of your report, and demonstrates your ability to interact with your own generated \nprimary data in an impartial and scientific manner. \nAfter you\u2019ve identified any potential limitations and the effect they may have had on your \nresults, it\u2019s important to state how they could be addressed in future reproductions of your \ninvestigation. What could you change about the method that would make your results \nmore accurate and precise? How could errors be avoided in the future? \nFinally, it\u2019s good to finish your discussion by weighing up these potential limitations with \nthe strengths of the investigation. Conclude by stating clearly whether or not your results \nand, therefore, your answer to your research question, can be relied upon.\nConclusion \nLots of people worry about writing conclusions, but they really aren\u2019t that hard!  \nYour conclusion should begin by restating your research question, and then state whether \nor not your hypothesis was supported or refuted by the data you collected. You then \nneed to suggest avenues of further research based on your findings and how future study \ncould address the limitations of your investigation. Finally, you should end your report by \nshowing how your findings are important to society/the environment/the world in general \n\u2013 just like you did in the introduction. After your conclusion, your audience should be  \nleft feeling like your findings and conclusions are important and have ramifications in the \nreal world. \nTHEORY315\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

It was hypothesised that plants exposed to higher levels of sunlight would \ngrow more compared to plants exposed to less sunlight. This hypothesis was supported by the results, \nwhich showed that Ficus lyrata bambino  plants exposed to more sunlight grew faster. Future research \nshould aim to refine the measuring techniques used to measure the growth of plants, and potentially \nexplore how other environmental factors influence plant growth. Future research might also explore plant \ngrowth in other plant species suitable for office life, as well as the effect of healthy plant life on office \nworker morale. \nNevertheless, it does seem that when placing plants in an office, consideration ought to be given to \nthe amount of sunlight plants will be exposed to, as sunlight availability seems to be a key determinant \nof plant growth. Ensuring plants are provided with the ideal conditions to thrive is important, as their \npresence contributes greatly to the workplace atmosphere and employee mood..How to conduct a practical investigation 316\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

It acts like a set of instructions which a cell will then read to create the \nimportant protein molecules needed for a range of cellular functions, such as growth and \nregeneration. The order of bases in the double helix determines which protein gets made. \nFor instance, the sequence \u2018ATG\u2019 will send different instructions than the sequence \u2018GGG\u2019. \nYou will learn more about this process in year 12. \nEach person has two copies of each gene, one inherited from their mother and the other \nfrom their father. In total, there are roughly 25 000 different genes inside each of your \ncells.

However, a small number  \nof genes (<1 per cent) are slightly different between people, which contributes to the \nimmense differences we see from person to person. These differences are a result of what \nwe call alleles , which are different forms of the same gene but with small differences in \ntheir base sequence. \nFor example, we each have genes that are responsible for the colour of our eyes. You might \nhave green eyes whilst your best friend might have brown eyes. These differences are \ncaused by differences in the alleles you each possess for the genes involved with eye  \ncolour (Figure 3).\nAllele 1: \nturquoise eye colourAllele 2: \ngreen eye colourAllele 3:\nblue eye colourAllele 4:\nhazel eye colourGene:  eye colour\nImage: Ron Dale/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 3\u2002 The relationship between genes and the expression of different alleles\nYou\u2019ll notice in Figure 3 that there are more allele variations than the two that you and \nyour friend might display. Instead of green eyes or brown eyes, perhaps another friend \nof yours has blue eyes or grey eyes. This is because genes, such as those involved in eye \ncolour, may have multiple possible alleles. \nHowever, only two alleles are present at the gene  locus of any one individual, each of \nwhich is inherited  from one parent \u2013 one from mum and one from dad. The allele that is \nultimately expressed in your phenotype  \u2013 that is, whether you have green eyes like your \nmum or blue eyes like your dad \u2013 will depend upon how these alleles interact with each \nother and which allele/s is dominant over the other. You will learn more about this in \nlesson 7C. \nBringing it all together\nAn organism\u2019s genome is the sum total of all of its DNA. This is measured by the number \nof base pairs contained in a haploid set of chromosomes. For example, the human genome \nis around three billion base pairs in length ( haploid ), which equates to roughly 25 000 \ndifferent genes. In comparison,  Anolis carolinens , a type of green tree lizard native to the \nsouthern parts of the United States, has a genome of around two million base pairs and \naround 16 533 genes. Figure 4 summarises the distinction between the genome, genes,  \nand alleles.\nA genome is the haploid set \nof chromosomes within an \norganism, including all of its \ngenes. A copy of the entire \ngenome is contained in all \ncells within the body that \nhave a nucleus.\nE.g. the human genome contains \naround 25 000 di\ufb00erent genes, \ncontributing to a total of more \nthan three billion individual\nbase pairs.An allele is an alternative form \nof a gene. We typically have \ntwo alleles \u2013/uni00A0one from each \nparent \u2013 which are found at \nthe same gene locus on \ncorresponding chromosomes.\nE.g. the OCA2 gene has a\nnumber of di\ufb00erent alleles relating \nto levels of protein P production \n(large amounts give rise to \ndarker/brown eyes, while smaller \namounts give rise of \nlighter/blue eyes).A gene is a section of DNA that \ncarries the code to make a protein. \nOur genes are what form the basis \nof inheritance, and can be found at \nspeci\ufb01c locations on our \nchromosomes (gene loci).\nE.g. the human gene OCA2\nis located on chromosome 15, \nand this codes for the production\nof protein P \u2013 which is partly \nresponsible for the colour of\nour eyes. \nFigure 4\u2002 Distinguishing between a genome, gene, and allele\nChromosomes and karyotypes \u20022.1.2.1 & 2.1.4.1\nOverview\nAn organism\u2019s genome sits inside the nucleus of each of their somatic cells in the form \nof DNA, which is then wrapped around proteins to form chromosomes.

In humans, this would mean that rather than being diploid  \n(2n = 46), the individual would be 3 n = 72 or more. \nPolyploidy is typically lethal in humans, meaning that it is extremely rare for a foetus to \nsurvive to term. However, it is quite common for other organisms, especially plants, to \nthrive with additional sets of chromosomes. For example, one advantage of polyploidy \nincludes increased size and hardiness in certain types of fruit. Even farmed Atlantic  \nsalmon are triploid. This makes the fish sterile, and also leads to a faster growth rate.\nTheory summary\nA gene is the basic unit responsible for the process of inheritance from one generation to \nthe next.

The enzyme plays an important role in the regular breakdown of \nserotonin, a neurotransmitter involved in mood regulation and emotion control in the brain. \nThe accused was shown to possess a mutation of this gene which caused a reduction in serotonin breakdown, and it was \nsuggested that this had led to a range of behavioural problems such as increased aggression and violence.

Young et al. (2008), for instance, explained that \nnesting success in birds was better understood only once female-to-\nfemale bonding was acknowledged, and Gowaty (1997) suggested that \nresearch into female variability unlocked a better understanding of \nsexual selection theory. \nThe same is true in how we describe meiosis, which often explains \nthe process specifically in terms of male gamete production (known \nas spermatogenesis). Instead, female gamete production, known as \noogenesis, is quite distinct and involves a single oocyte (immature \negg cell) dividing into one functional ovum and three polar bodies, \nwhich are themselves unviable. The first round of meiosis in females \nwill occur during development as a foetus but will be halted until the \nindividual hits puberty. This suggests that females are born with all of \nthe primary oocytes they will ever have in life (roughly six million), and \nwill eventually run out of their supply of viable eggs. \nFinally, the pattern of recombination that occurs during crossing over can also differ between males and females of the same \nspecies. As Brick et al. (2018) found, the female crossover rate was much higher than the male crossover rate in humans and \nin mice. Ultimately, these sex-specific differences in meiotic division are underrepresented due to a historic male-centric bias \nin biological research and are necessary considerations in developing a more complete understanding of an organism\u2019s biology, \nincluding their sexual behaviour. \nQuestion  11 \nWhich of the following correctly summarises the difference in functional gamete production between male spermatogenesis \nand female oogenesis?\nA Both spermatogenesis and oogenesis result in the production of four viable gametes, each capable of transferring its DNA \nto the next generation.\nB Spermatogenesis results in the production of four polar bodies, each capable of transferring its DNA, whereas oogenesis \nresults in the production of three polar bodies. \nC Spermatogenesis results in the production of four distinct functional gametes, each of which is capable of transferring its \nDNA to the next generation. Oogenesis, on the other hand, results in the production of only one functional gamete. \nQuestion  12 \nReference to past studies in the first paragraph best serve which of the following purposes in the above extract? \nA examples of male-centric bias in zoological (animal) biology\nB examples of the benefits of being aware of sex differences in research\nC examples of female-focused studies showing better methodology than male-focused studies\nQuestion  13 \nA recent article was published in a major newspaper.

  "Page 356": "Theory  details\nHomozygous vs heterozygous\nEvery  diploid organism inherits a particular combination of two alleles from their parents. \nIf an individual inherits two identical alleles from both their mother and father, they are \nsaid to be homozygous   for that gene. For example, both parents might pass on the allele \nfor hitchhiker\u2019s thumb (hyper-flexible thumb) to their offspring. In this case, the gametes \nproduced by that individual will always contain the same allele for hitchhiker\u2019s thumb \n(Figure 1). \nBut what happens when an offspring inherits two different alleles for the same gene?  \nFor example, they might inherit an allele for hitchhiker\u2019s thumb from their mother but  \nan allele for regular thumb flexibility from their father. We call a person with two different \nalleles for the same gene heterozygous  for that gene. In this case, due to meiosis, the \ngametes produced by that heterozygous individual will be of two kinds \u2013 half having the \nallele for hitchhiker\u2019s thumb and half having the allele for regular thumb flexibility.\nHomozygous Heterozygous= hitchhiker\u2019s thumb allele\n= regular thumb alleleKey\nFigure 2\u2002 A visual representation of homozygosity and heterozygosity. Notice that the homozygote will always \nproduce gametes that contain an allele for hitchhiker\u2019s thumb, whereas the heterozygote could produce gametes \nthat contain either an allele for hitchhiker\u2019s thumb or an allele for regular thumb flexibility.\nDominant vs recessive alleles\nIn the case of a heterozygote, it is not immediately obvious which gene will be expressed. \nInstead, we must understand that alleles can be either dominant or recessive. \n\u2022 A dominant allele  can be thought of as the stronger form of a pair of alleles and is \nrepresented with a capital letter. We call it a dominant allele because it will always  \nbe expressed even if the individual only has one copy of that allele (as is the case with \nheterozygotes). For example, the allele for brown eyes is dominant, meaning that you \nonly need to inherit one copy of the \u2018brown eye\u2019 allele from one of your parents to have \nbrown eyes. \n\u2022 A recessive allele  can be thought of as the weaker form of a pair of alleles, and is \nrepresented with a lowercase letter. We call it the recessive allele because it will  \nonly be expressed if the individual has two copies of that allele (that is, if they are \nhomozygous for the recessive allele). For example, the allele for blue eyes is recessive, \nmeaning that you need to inherit two copies of the \u2018blue eye\u2019 allele (one from each \nparent) to have blue eyes. \nThis is called complete dominance \u2013 when a dominant allele is fully expressed in a \nphenotype  and masks the expression of a recessive allele. Although a dominant allele \nmay mask the expression of a recessive allele, a person who is heterozygous at a specific \ngene locus is still a carrier , meaning they are able to pass on the recessive allele to their \noffspring despite not displaying the trait. \nBe careful not to assume that dominant alleles are always more common than recessive \nalleles. For example, achondroplasia, or dwarfism, is a dominant trait over the recessive \ntrait for regular height.

We call this a heterozygote advantage. This can help explain why \nharmful recessive alleles are able to persist in a population over time, hidden in fit heterozygotes, rather \nthan being removed via natural selection.\nOne example of heterozygote advantage is the sickle cell trait, caused by a mutation in the gene \nencoding haemoglobin. The sickle cell trait is expressed according to incomplete dominance, where the \nmutated form of haemoglobin causes red blood cells to become sickle-shaped when exposed to low \noxygen levels. The misshapen red blood cells can block capillaries and are bad at transporting oxygen. \nTwo copies of the sickle cell allele leads to a high degree of sickling in the blood, causing the disease \nsickle cell anemia (SCA). SCA confers a strong resistance to malaria, but because SCA often results in \npremature death from damage to internal organs or stroke the disease is generally selected against.\nIndividuals who are heterozygous or homozygous for the normal type haemoglobin allele do not suffer \nfrom sickle cell anemia, despite heterozygous individuals displaying low levels of red blood cell sickling. \nHowever, due to this low level of sickling, heterozygous carriers of the sickle cell allele have greater malaria \nresistance than individuals homozygous for the normal haemoglobin allele. Furthermore, when infected \nwith malaria the red blood cells of heterozygous individuals are more likely to sickle and become targeted \nby the immune system, conveying further resistance to the malaria parasite (Figure 3). This means that it is \nadvantageous to be heterozygous in malarial regions, such as Africa and Asia. As a result, the deleterious \nrecessive allele persists in populations, despite the deadliness of being homozygous for the sickle cell trait. \nHomozygous dominant (SS)\nNormal red blood cellsHomozygous recessive (ss)\nMostly sickle cells\nInfected cells become\nsickle-shaped, and\nare destroyed by\nimmune cellsHeterozygous (Ss)\nNormal red blood cells \nand some sickle cells\nSickle cellsExposure to\nmalaria\nFigure 3\u2002 The genotypes and phenotypes for sickle cell anaemiaChapter 7: Geneti CS 346\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

You will learn more about this in lesson 7D.\nCan you roll your tongue like the woman in Figure 6? \nCurrent research suggests that the ability to roll the tongue \ninto a tube shape is controlled by a single gene that exhibits \ncomplete dominance.\nIn this case, we have two possible phenotypes: (1) being \nable to roll your tongue into a tube shape and (2) not \nbeing able to roll your tongue into a tube shape. These two \nphenotypes are controlled in large by the presence of two \npossible alleles \u2013 one for tongue rolling, which is dominant \n(T) and one for non-tongue rolling, which is recessive (t).\nAs an activity, count how many of your classmates can roll their tongue into a tube shape.

The possible \ngenotypes that an individual can possess are shown in Figure 5.

In some cases, a particular gene might show either codominance or \nincomplete dominance. \nTheory  details\nIf a gene is inherited with complete dominance, only one allele from the genotype is \nexpressed in the phenotype. For example, if a flower has the genotype \u2018Aa\u2019 in respect \nto petal colour \u2013 where capital \u2018A\u2019 is red petals and lowercase \u2018a\u2019 is white petals \u2013 then \ncomplete dominance would mean that the flower would exhibit red petals in its  \nphenotype. However, there are two other patterns of dominance: \n\u2022 Codominance , which occurs when both alleles from the genotype are fully expressed \nin the phenotype of a heterozygote. That is, both alleles can be thought of as dominant \nand neither allele can mask the expression of the other allele. \n\u2022 Incomplete dominance , which occurs when neither allele from the genotype is fully \nexpressed in the phenotype of a heterozygote, and the resulting observable trait is a \n\u2018blending\u2019 of both alleles.\nContinuing with our example of flower petal colour (Figure 7), if the gene responsible \ndisplayed codominance, we would expect to see both red and white petals in a heterozygote. \nHowever, if the gene for petal colour showed incomplete dominance, heterozygotes would \nexhibit a brand new trait that was a mixture of red and white \u2013 say, pink. \nBecause neither allele is completely dominant in codominance and incomplete dominance, \nwe have to write genotypes a little differently. Here, we use a standard capital letter  \nthat stays the same, and two different superscript letters to represent the two different \nalleles (Table 2).\ntable 2\u2002 The letters used to describe homozygosity and heterozygosity for codominance and incomplete \ndominance.

Genes are also found  \non the sex chromosomes of an organism and are often closely related to the gender of that \norganism. These genes are known as  sex-linked genes , and are represented differently  \nin genotypes.\nWhat are sex-linked genes?\nSex-linked genes  are genes present on either the X or Y chromosomes. However, the X \nchromosome is much longer than the Y chromosome, containing as many as 4 000 more \ngenes. Therefore, when thinking about sex-linked inheritance, we are usually referring \nmore specifically to X-linked traits , as these are far more common. Y-linked traits  also \nexist, but are quite rare and only show up in males.\nX-linked traits are also more likely to be expressed in males than they are in females.  \nThis is because each male only receives one copy of an X chromosome, which comes \nfrom their mother. Whatever allele a male receives on the inherited copy of their X \nchromosome is what is expressed in their phenotype, regardless of whether that allele is \ndominant or recessive. There is no corresponding allele on the Y chromosome to cancel \nout the effects of the allele on the X chromosome. This means that if the allele is faulty and \ncauses a condition, then that male has a 100% chance of showing that condition. \nHowever, males with X-linked traits or conditions are unable to pass the trait on to their \nsons. This is because if a male has a son, that son must receive their Y chromosome \nfrom their father. Affected males can only pass on the abnormal X-linked gene to their \ndaughters (Figure 11). \nFather with abnormal gene\non the X chromosomeMother with normal gene\non the X chromosome\nFemale o\ufb00spring receive abnormal gene.\nMale o\ufb00spring do not receive abnormal gene.Sex-linked dominant\nParents:\nO\ufb00spring:\nImage: udaix/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 11\u2002 X-linked inheritance with an affected fathersex-linked genes\u2002 genes that are \nlocated on a sex chromosome \nX-linked traits\u2002 a trait controlled \nby a gene that is located on the  \nX chromosome\nY-linked traits\u2002 a trait controlled \nby a gene that is located on the  \nY chromosome\nImage:Nathan Devery/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 10\u2002 X (left) and  \nY (right) chromosomesINCOMPLETE DOMINANCE IN ACTION \u2013 PINK SNAPDRAGONS \nConsider the snapdragon, Antirrhinum majus , which \nyou might see in your nanna\u2019s garden.

This means that the mutation that causes \nhaemophilia A is a recessive allele that is inherited on the X chromosome of an organism, and will be \nmasked by the normal F8 allele. Because males only have one X chromosome, if that chromosome \ncontains the mutated gene then they will show the condition, whereas females must inherit two copies \nof the faulty allele.

One such disorder is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, which is caused by a mutation  \nin the G6PD  gene and can lead to the premature breakdown of red blood cells in the body. \nNormally, the G6PD  gene provides instructions for making a protein that protects red blood cells from being damaged by certain \ntypes of molecules introduced by the environment. These molecules can come from malarial infection or a diet rich in fava beans. \nDue to the malfunctioning protein, red blood cells are more likely to be destroyed by these molecules leading to the development \nof haemolytic anaemia, a condition in which red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be replaced. This leads to \nsymptoms such as paleness, yellowing of the skin, dark urine, fatigue, and a rapid heart rate in affected individuals. \nRecent data estimates that around 400 million people worldwide possess the G6PD protein deficiency. These numbers \nare concentrated largely in certain areas of Africa and Asia, where instances of malaria infections are high. Moreover, the \ndeficiency occurs almost exclusively in males. For instance, approximately 1 in 5 boys in Malawi are deficient in the G6PD \nprotein, while the number of affected females is comparatively much smaller. \nQuestion  7 \nA deficiency in G6PD protein causes\nA the premature breakdown of red blood cells. \nB introduction of certain molecules that can be harmful to red blood cells.\nQuestion  8 \nMalfunctioning of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase protein is known as \nA haemolytic anaemia. \nB G6PD protein deficiency.

We call this idea proportionate \nheritability , where an organism\u2019s phenotype is explained partly by genes and partly  \nby environmental factors. environment\u2002 the conditions  \nand resources external to an \norganism with which that \norganism typically interacts \nproportionate heritability\u2002  \nthe amount of phenotypic variance \nthat can be explained by genes  \nin a given population\nProportionate heritability tells us that an organism\u2019s phenotype can be entirely due  \nto the environment \u2013 such as when someone dyes their hair a completely new colour. \nOther times, genes play the main role in determining phenotype. This is the case \nwith blood types: if you\u2019re O-positive then you\u2019ll remain O-positive regardless of the \nenvironment you inhabit. Most of the time though, your phenotype is the result of a \nmixture of genetic influences and environmental influences. For instance, you can inherit \ngenes that increase your risk of obesity, but remain a healthy weight with the right \nenvironment and behaviours. Further, you might inherit a genetic predisposition for a \ndegenerative nerve disease, but regular recreational drug use might speed up the process \nby damaging the way nerve cells normally send, receive, and process information.\nIt is important to understand that these environmental factors will rarely affect  \nlevels of gene expression itself, such as the amount of protein that is produced.  \nInstead, environmental factors will typically act in ways that influence the performance \nof an organism\u2019s proteins in their phenotype. Scientists describe this as modifying the \nfunction of proteins, rather than affecting the creation of the proteins themselves. PROPORTIONATE HERITABILITY \u2013 HEIGHT IN HUMANS\nScientists have tried to determine how much of the variation seen  \nin human height can be attributed to genetic influences and how \nmuch to environmental factors like nutrition. According to the  \nUS National Library of Medicine (2020), the difference in height \nbetween individuals is around 70 to 80 per cent a result of genetic \nfactors, while the remaining 20 to 30 per cent is due to nutrition  \nand diet. In addition, results show that proportionate height \nheritability varies from one population to another depending on \na person\u2019s ethnic background. This is because different ethnic \npopulations have different genetic backgrounds and live in different \nenvironments where their diet and lifestyle vary significantly. \nAustralian men have been found to exhibit a heritability proportion of around 80 per cent and an average \nheight of 178 centimetres. This means that if we meet a man in the street who differs from the average \nheight of the population, we can understand what fraction of the variance in his phenotype is caused by \ngenetic differences and what fraction is due to his environment. For example, if an Australian man is 185 cm \ntall (7 cm taller than average), we might assume that 80 per cent of the extra 7 cm (5.6 cm) is due to his \ninherited genetic variation, while the remaining 1.4 cm is due to environmental influences, mainly nutrition.\nImage: Dragon Images/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 1\u2002 So your mum wasn\u2019t \nlying when she said eating your \nveggies would make you grow!\nHIMALAYAN RABBITS\nHimalayan rabbits possess a particular allele that codes for \nthe production of the enzyme tyrosinase, which is responsible \nfor speeding up the production of melanin. Tyrosinase is \na heat-sensitive enzyme and is inactive at normal body \ntemperature. This leads to no melanin production in the rabbit \nand leaves the organism with a white fur coat. However, the \ntyrosinase enzyme becomes activated when it is exposed to \nlow temperatures, causing it to produce melanin. This, in turn, \ncauses black fur to form on the rabbit, especially around the \nextremities which are areas that tend to be cooler. \nNote that in this example, the environmental stimulus (heat level) is not limiting the expression of the \ngene involved in the overall production of tyrosinase. Instead, changes in temperature influence the \nperformance of the protein (tyrosinase) that is created, either by causing it to be activated or inactivated. \nImage: Linn Currie/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 2\u2002 A Himalayan rabbit showing \nvarying fur colouring.

  "Page 369": "Epigenetics \u20022.1.9.2\nOverview\nPhenotypes are also influenced by epigenetics, which are molecular interactions with \nDNA that modify the expression of genes. These epigenetic mechanisms either boost or \ninhibit the transcription of genes into proteins. \nTheory  details\nWhat is epigenetics? \nEarlier in this lesson, you learned that an organism\u2019s phenotype is a result of the interactions \nbetween its genes and its environment. These environmental influences will typically alter \nthe performance of certain proteins. In some cases, however, environmental factors may \ncause changes to a gene that activate or deactivate the expression of that gene. This affects \nthe amount of protein produced, which subsequently alters an individual\u2019s phenotype. \nWe call these changes epigenetic modifications, which can be thought of as the bridge \nbetween the environment and genotype. Environmental signals are translated into \nbiochemical changes inside a cell that lead to increased or decreased  gene expression . \nUltimately, epigenetic factors influence gene expression by determining which genes are \n\u2018turned on or off\u2019, but they do not alter the actual DNA sequence. This is often in response \nto environmental changes, such as exposure to certain chemicals.\nHow does epigenetics work? \nA gene is  expressed  when the protein it carries the instructions for is built by a cell.  \nThis occurs through the processes of transcription  and translation,  which you\u2019ll learn \nmore about in Unit 3. For now, you should know that:\n1 transcription involves reading and copying out a gene sequence from a DNA molecule. \nThis \u2018copy\u2019 of the gene (called mRNA) then moves out of the nucleus to ribosomes in \nthe cytosol or on the rough endoplasmic reticulum for translation. \n2 during translation, mRNA instructs the ribosome how to build the specific protein for \nwhich the DNA sequence codes.\nDNAcopy of gene\n(mRNA)proteintranscription translation\nFigure 3\u2002 The process of gene expression involves transcription and translation.\nEpigenetic changes alter the process of transcription. They are caused by molecules \nthat increase or decrease the amount of transcription of a particular gene and therefore \nalter the amount of protein that is produced. In this way, epigenetics can regulate the \nexpression of specific proteins, which is important for a number of different areas of \ngrowth and development of organisms.\nThere are many different types of epigenetic modifications. Two types of epigenetic \nchanges that you need to be aware of are: \n1 DNA methylation  \u2013 occurs when methyl groups (small hydrocarbon molecules) attach \nto certain nucleotides within the DNA sequence of a particular gene and alter levels of \ngene expression, typically by causing that gene to be silenced. DNA demethylation, in \ncontrast, refers to the removal of methyl groups from a DNA sequence, and typically \nleads to a gene being expressed. \n2 histone modification \u2013 occurs when histone-modifying enzymes known as histone \nmethyltransferases (HMT) join methyl groups to histone tails and modify how tightly \na DNA molecule is wrapped around it. If the DNA is condensed tighter around the \nhistone, it makes it more difficult for the genes to be transcribed and less likely to be \nexpressed. Alternatively, if the DNA becomes less tightly packed, the genes will be \neasier to transcribe and more likely to be expressed. epigenetics\u2002 changes to  \nan organism\u2019s phenotype  \nresulting from modifications  \nto gene expression\ngene expression\u2002 the process of \nreading the information stored \nwithin a gene to create a functional \nproduct, typically a protein\ntranscription\u2002 the process \nwhereby a sequence of DNA is \nused to produce a complementary \nsequence of mRNA\ntranslation\u2002 the process whereby \nan mRNA sequence is used to \nproduce a protein\nDNA methylation\u2002 the process by \nwhich methyl (-CH3) groups are \nadded to particular nucleotides in \na DNA segment so as to modify \nthe expression of a geneepigenetic \nfactor\nX presentepigenetic \nfactor\nX absent\ngene Z\nturned ongene Z\nturned o\ufb00\nno protein\nproducedprotein\nproduced\nphenotype\nAphenotype\nB\nFigure 4\u2002 The presence or absence \nof an epigenetic factor can mean \nthe same gene produces different \nphenotypes.

These include:\n\u2022 helping to control cell differentiation \u2013 despite containing the same DNA, not all of  \nthe cells inside an organism are the same. Different cell types, whether they be skin \ncells, bone cells, or muscle cells, all look unique and serve tissue-specific functions.  \nThe development of these different cell types is regulated largely by epigenetic \nmechanisms that turn off unneeded genes and promote expression of required genes. \n\u2022 providing a mechanism for a developing organism to respond to its environment \u2013 \nepigenetic modifications act as a rapid feedback mechanism by which an organism \ncan respond to changes in their environment. For example, during hot weather, \nplants require proteins that help reduce heat shock. The genes for these proteins are \nstimulated by high temperatures to demethylate, activating transcription and ensuring \nmore of these useful proteins are synthesised. \nEpigenetics across generations \nEpigenetic changes can be passed onto daughter cells during mitosis. This means that they \ncould affect an individual organism throughout the entire course of its life. For that reason \nwe describe epigenetic features as being somatically heritable , in that they are able to be \npassed on from somatic cell to somatic cell indefinitely across the lifespan of an organism. \nIt\u2019s also one of the reasons why identical twins become increasingly different as they age \n\u2013 not only are their genes being switched on or off by exposure to different environmental \nfactors, but those changes are also being passed onto new cells as they  \ngrow and regenerate.Epigenetics plays an important \nrole in much of our body\u2019s \ngrowth and development.  \nThis includes foetal \ndevelopment and stem cell \ndifferentiation ( lesson 4D ) \nand our adaptations for \nsurvival ( lessons 10A  and 10B). \nsomatically heritable\u2002 genetic \ntraits or alterations to a cell which \nare inherited by daughter cells \nduring the course of regular mitotic \ncell divisionEPIGENETICS AND FRUIT\nEpigenetic factors play an important role in agriculture, particularly \nin the growth and ripening of fruit.

The chemical trigger that \ncontrols this process in many fruits is the hormone ethylene, which \ncan also be made into a gas for commercial use by farms. \nImage: Bozena Fulawka/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 7\u2002 Juicy, ripe tomatoes.  \nIs there more or less methylation \non the DNA of these fruits \ncompared to unripe tomatoes? 7D T hEOrY 359\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

For example, a growing  \nbody of state and federal level statutes on environmental regulation, including the  Industrial Chemicals Act 2019  and more \nbroadly, the National Clean Air Agreement 2015 , explore the risks associated with chemical exposure. While these government \ninitiatives do not explicitly call for epigenetic testing by manufacturers, the assessments they involve could foreseeably \nincorporate this in the future. Such chemical testing could raise critical issues surrounding how we define \u2018toxicity\u2019,  \nas manufacturers may be increasingly responsible for reporting whether their products could have adverse epigenetic effects \non their consumers. \nThe impact of epigenetics on public health could also raise a variety of ethical concerns. For example, toxic chemicals and \nairborne pollutants are not distributed randomly throughout society, but instead follow a socioeconomic trend whereby \nexposure is more heavily linked to poorer communities in industrialised and urban areas. As such, if future research \ndemonstrates that epigenetic changes more readily affect the most vulnerable members of society, governments and  \nindustry will be morally obliged to work to remove environmental risk and prevent harmful exposure. \nQuestion  9 \nWhich of the following best summarises the first paragraph of the extract? \nA Recent legal developments introduced by state and federal governments have placed stringent epigenetic regulations  \non businesses and manufacturers, including testing and researching of their products and services. \nB Interesting legal implications might begin to arise as epigenetic research continues to grow, especially regarding the \nresponsibility of manufacturers to be aware of possible epigenetic consequences associated with their actions.\nQuestion  10 \nWhich of the following best summarises the second paragraph of the extract? \nA Epigenetics also raises interesting ethical questions, including how it could impact the health and wellbeing of different \ngroups within society. Future research might inform governments and manufacturers on how industry disproportionately \naffects vulnerable members of society. \nB One ethical concern associated with epigenetic research is how low-socioeconomic communities might respond \ndifferently to the same epigenetic changes faced by middle-class communities.

These are pairs of one maternal and one paternal chromosome that share the same genes \nand are of similar size. \nWe can learn a lot from looking at a karyotype, including:\n\u2022 Species : this is a human \u2013 it has 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes and diploid number (2 n) of 46.\n\u2022 Gender : this is a male \u2013 it has one X and one Y chromosome. We call the X and Y chromosomes sex \nchromosomes, and all other chromosomes autosomes. \n\u2022 Genetic health : this individual does not appear to possess any obvious genetic abnormalities, and has \na standard diploid number of 46. We can use karyotypes to check for disorders relating to aneuploidy \n(incorrect total number of chromosomes \u2013 e.g. 47) or polyploidy (incorrect number of sets of \nchromosomes \u2013 e.g. n or 3 n).1 2 3 4 5\n67 8 9 10 11 12\n13 14 15 16 17 18\n19 20 21 22 XY\nImage: Kateryna Kon/Shutterstock.comDistinguishing between a genome, a gene, and an allele\nA genome is the haploid set of \nchromosomes, including all of its \ngenes. A copy of the entire genome is \ncontained in all cells within the body that \nhave a nucleus.\nE.g. the human genome contains around\n25 000 di\ufb00erent genes, contributing to a \ntotal of more than three billion individual\nbase pairs.A gene is a section of DNA that carries the\ncode to make a protein. Our genes are what \nform the basis of inheritance, and can be\n found at speci\ufb01c locations on our\n chromosomes (gene loci).\nE.g. the human gene OCA2  is located on \nchromosome 15, and codes for the \nproduction of protein P \u2013 which is partly \nresponsible for the colour of our eyes. An allele is an alternative form of a \ngene. We typically have two alleles \u2013/uni00A0\none from each parent \u2013 which are found \nat the same gene loci on corresponding \nchromosomes.\nE.g. the OCA2  gene has a number\nof di\ufb00erent alleles relating to levels of\nprotein P production (large amounts give\nrise to darker/brown eyes, while smaller \namounts give rise of lighter/blue eyes).\nProportionate influence on a phenotype \nGenetics\nThe foundation for the phenotype is the \ngenome - which is the complete set of DNA \nthat codes for all the proteins necessary for \nan organism to function.Environment\nPhenotype is in\ufb02uenced by environmental \nfactors like temperature and nutrients - which \na\ufb00ect the performance of those proteins coded \nfor by DNA.Epigenetics\nPhenotype is also in\ufb02uenced by epigenetic \nfactors - which modify the expression\nof DNA and often alter the amount of \nprotein produced.\nPhenotype\nAn organism\u2019s phenotype is all of its physical and biochemical characteristics.

Estimating heritability can be extremely difficult for researchers, as it often involves observing \nthe phenotypes of different organisms and then retrospectively assessing environmental influences that may have \nalready occurred without being observed by the researchers themselves. \nNonetheless, one method for arriving at a ratio of proportionate heritability is by comparing data between the expected \nphenotypic resemblance between relatives, and the actual observed phenotypic resemblance between those relatives. \nTraditionally, this has been estimated from simple correlation studies between offspring and their parents, full and  \nhalf-siblings, as well as between twins. \nTwo groups of geneticists from separate research laboratories have decided to produce computationally-derived \nscatterplot models using large-scale, empirical family data on two traits. To do this, each group has entered the values \nof the offspring phenotypes on the y-axis, and the average value of two parental phenotypes for each offspring on the \nx-axis. From there, the researchers conduct a linear regression analysis to arrive at a heritability ratio for the two traits. \nTheir results are shown in the scatterplots, where A is a trait with low heritability and B is a trait with high heritability.\nTrait A Trait BO\ufb00spring phenotype\nParental phenotypeGroup 1\nO\ufb00spring phenotype\nParental phenotypeH = 0.2\n3 -33 -3H = 0.8\n3 -33 -3O\ufb00spring phenotype\nParental phenotypeH = 0.3\nO\ufb00spring phenotype\nParental phenotypeH = 0.7Group 2\n3 -33 -33 -33 -3\n1 Based on the scatterplots of the two groups, which set of family data shows the highest heritability value? \u2002(1 MARK)\n2 Based on the scatterplots of the two groups, suggest one limitation of Group 2\u2019s modelling. \u2002(1 MARK)\n3 At the conclusion of their research, both groups agreed that a high heritability ratio can still entail a great deal of \nphenotypic variability. Even if H = 1.0, the phenotypes of offspring and parents are not identical. With reference to \nthe process of meiotic cell division, explain how this is possible. \u2002(2 MARKS)\nGenetics and university success \nA large body of research has suggested that a person\u2019s genetics is a significant contributing factor to their level of \nachievement during school, not only in early childhood but also late into tertiary education. This research has led to  \na significant push to better understand the proportionate heritability behind university success. For example, a 2014 \nstudy by Krapohl et al. indicates that the genetic features of personality, intelligence, and mental health account for  \nas high as 0.75 of the heritability responsible for GCSE scores \u2013 a score given to secondary school students in the  \nUnited Kingdom.\nREVIEW367\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

(2018), which used a sample of 3 000 individuals and 3 000 twin pairs, \nsuggests a genetic influence on university entrance exam achievement (0.57), university enrolment (0.51), university \nquality (0.57), and university achievement (0.46). Consequently, the study suggests that between 43% and 54% of the \ndifferences in the university success of their sample were due to environmental factors. However, when these figures \nwere broken down further, it was shown that the main environmental influences were \u2018individual-specific\u2019, such as \nfriends and social status, rather than environmental factors that twins might share, such as family environment. \n4 The data show that individual environmental factors, such as friendships, have a larger influence on  \nuniversity success than shared environmental factors such as family environment. Using a consequences\u2013based \napproach to bioethics, outline how this information might influence an intervention aimed at increasing  \nuniversity success. \u2002(1 MARK)\nSimilar research has shown that the importance of genes on schooling success varies depending on where a child grows \nup.

For example, Haworth et al. \n(2008) conducted repeated twin analyses of the body mass index (BMI) of more than 7 000 children and showed that \nthe heritability ratio for BMI increased from 0.48 at age 4 to 0.78 at age 11. It was also found that a specific gene, the FTO \ngene found on chromosome 16, was a strong genetic correlate for BMI levels. The association between the FTO gene and \nBMI levels also became stronger during childhood, and increased in parallel to heritability.\nThis increase meant that the proportionate influence of environmental factors also changed, including shared twin \nfactors such as socioeconomic status and family lifestyle, as well as non-shared factors such as individual friendship \ngroups. These findings, along with the genetic heritability ratios from ages 4 to 11, are summarised in the graph.\nAge (years)Heritability ratio\n00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91\n4 7 10 11Key\nGenetic\nEnvironment - shared\nEnvironment - non-shared\n7 Identify the independent and dependent variables in the Haworth et al. study. \u2002(2 MARKS)\n8 Outline two strengths of using twins in this experiment. \u2002(2 MARK)\n9 Based on the graph provided, describe the change in genetic heritability between the ages of 7 and 10. \u2002(1 MARK)\n10 Based on the graph provided, describe the change to the heritability ratio of shared environmental influences \nbetween the ages of 4 and 7. \u2002(1 MARK)\n11 Based on the information provided, describe the relationship between the FTO gene and BMI levels in  \nyoung children. \u2002(1 MARK)Chapter 7: Geneti Cs 368\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

These sickled \ncells can get caught in small blood vessels creating blockages or clots and do not carry \noxygen as efficiently as normal red blood cells. As red blood cells are responsible for \ntransporting oxygen around the body, sickle cell anaemia can be a fatal disease.\nThe two alleles are normal red blood cells (HbA) and sickle cell anaemia (HbS).  \nIndividuals that are heterozygous show mild symptoms of sickle cell anaemia.  \nHowever, a benefit of having an HbS allele is that it confers resistance to malaria.\nA Punnett square has been made up from a cross between two heterozygous individuals.\nAround the world, sickle cell anaemia varies in prevalence in different regions.

This means that during meiosis, because they are on the same chromosome, \nthey are inherited together and are not separated during independent assortment .

The dominant allele for RHD  results in a positive blood type, \nwhile the recessive allele results in a negative blood type \u2013 for example, O+ and O\u2013, respectively. \nElliptocytosis, on the other hand, is an inherited dominant blood disorder where an individual\u2019s red blood \ncells are more oval-shaped, rather than a biconcave disc (Figure 4). These two genes are linked, and are \ntherefore commonly inherited together and are less likely to be separated during meiosis.\ncont\u2019dCHapTER  8: In HERIT anCE 386\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",
  "Page 398": "Linked genes can be found in fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster  (Figure 5). On their \nsecond chromosome are three linked genes that encode body colour, eye colour, and  \nwing size. Their body colour can be grey (B) or black (b), their eye colour can be red (E)  \nor brown (e), and their wing size can be normal (W) or vestigial (w).\nFor unlinked genes, we can consistently predict offspring genotypes and phenotypes \nbecause all the genes sort independently. This means we get nice ratios like 1 : 1 : 1 : 1  \nwhen crossing a heterozygous individual with a homozygous recessive individual.  \nFor linked genes, however, we can\u2019t assume two alleles on the same chromosome will  \nend up in the same gamete. Because of crossing over, the two alleles may occasionally  \nend up on different chromosomes and in different gametes. \nThe chances of crossing over occurring are calculated by using map units  (Figure 6).  \nOne map unit equates to a one per cent chance of crossing over and the offspring \ncontaining a recombinant chromosome .

A good clue for identifying linkage is seeing unusual genotypic \nratios in offspring (i.e. a few genotypes that arise very rarely) or genotypes that were \nnot present in the parents. Remember that if you did a dihybrid test cross between a \nheterozygote and a homozygous recessive individual, unlinked genes would result in a \ngenotypic ratio of 1 : 1 : 1 : 1.

Females will possess two X chromosomes, while a male  \nwill possess an X and a Y chromosome. This is determined during embryonic development due to the presence of the SRY  \n(sex-determining region) gene on the Y chromosome, which activates a number of other genes to produce male features.\nIn very rare cases, the X and Y chromosome can undergo crossing over resulting in an X chromosome that possesses the \nSRY gene from the Y chromosome ( SRY + X chromosome), and vice versa in males ( SRY \u2013 Y chromosome). In these cases, \nindividuals will appear phenotypically different from the sex suggested by their karyotype and will be infertile.\nA controversial example of this condition occurred at the 2006 \nAsian Games, where Santhi Soundarajan was a female athlete \ncompeting in the 800 m. She was stripped of her silver medal as \nit was revealed that she was XY female. Whilst Santhi expressed \nfemale genitalia, she did not regularly menstruate.\nGeneticists wish to perform a dihybrid cross to show the potential \noffspring\u2019s genotypes between the SRY and DAX1  genes.

  "Page 426": "Theory  details\nWhat is genetic diversity? \nThe genetic diversity of a population  refers to the amount of genetic variation  \nthat exists between individuals. This is measured by reference to the population\u2019s  \ngene pool , which is the sum of all of the different genes  and alleles  that are present in \na population and, by extension, a species. A larger, or more diverse, gene pool contains \na greater variety of different genes and alleles, meaning that the population will have a \ngreater variety of genotypes and phenotypes.\nThe gene pool of a population is influenced and maintained by a number of naturally \noccurring mechanisms, including mutations, genetic drift, gene flow, and natural selection. \nYou will learn more about each of these in more detail in Year 12. For now, it is enough  \nto understand what genetic diversity is, and the effect genetic diversity has on a \npopulation\u2019s wellbeing.\nWhy is genetic diversity important?\nGenetic diversity is vitally important in protecting the longevity of a species by  \nguarding against disadvantageous environmental changes, like new diseases or predators. \nThe larger the gene pool, the greater that population\u2019s resilience to environmental change. \nThis is because populations with a greater number of alleles are more likely to contain \nalleles that are already well adapted to survive the new environmental challenges. \nFor example, in Figure 2, assume that one population (A) of flowering plant contained \nonly one allele for petal colour \u2013 bright red \u2013 whilst another population (B) contained five \nalleles for petal colour. In this case, population B has a larger gene pool than population A. \nIf a new species of predator was introduced that was attracted to red flowers, population A \nwould suffer much more than population B (Figure 2).population\u2002 a group of individuals \nof the same species living in the \nsame location\ngene pool\u2002 the total number  \nof individual alleles within a \nparticular population \ngene\u2002 a section of DNA that \ncarries the code to make a protein\nallele\u2002 alternate forms of a gene\nBB Bb BB\nBbbb\nBBBB\nbb\nB\nBBb\nbB\nBbB\nb\nBBb\nBbB\nImage: nortongo, SGV_Arts /Shutterstock.com\nFigure 1\u2002 Visual representation of a \n\u2018gene pool\u2019\nenvironmental\nchange \u2013 new\npredator species\nPopulation A Population B\nImage: Vovanlanovich, HitToon/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 2\u2002 The importance of genetic \ndiversity in guarding against drastic \nenvironmental changesThink of genetic diversity as a game of roulette. If one \npopulation decides to bet all of their money on a single \nnumber, say number four, while another population \ndecides to spread its money out and bet on twenty \ndifferent numbers \u2013 the second population has a much \nhigher chance of winning (shall we say, surviving) the \nfall of the ball. \nIn the same way, if a given population has a higher \nnumber of different alleles present in its gene pool, \nthen that population is more likely to survive a new \nenvironmental threat than other populations with much \nless genetic diversity.\nImage: nazarovsergey/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 3\u2002 Roulette is analogous to genetic diversity\nWILD CHEETAHS \nCheetahs ( Acinonyx jubatus ) are well known for their \nlack of genetic diversity, which resulted from a large \npopulation collapse around 12 000 years ago at the end \nof the last ice age. \nThe reduced genetic diversity of the cheetah population \nmakes it vulnerable to environmental changes. Due to \nincreasing habitat encroachment and poaching, the \nvulnerable cheetah population, and its genetic diversity, \nis beginning to shrink even further. Low genetic diversity \nin the population has resulted in increased inbreeding \nbetween closely related individuals, which increases the likelihood of birth defects occurring in offspring. \nCurrently, only around five per cent of cheetahs survive to adulthood. \nImage: Vaganundo_Che/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 4\u2002 Wild cheetah populations are \nvulnerable due to low genetic diversity.9A theor Y 415\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

There are many different methods of sexual reproduction, each of which \nhave evolved over time due to the environmental pressures facing the species, such as \nresource availability and predation.\nIt is helpful to think of these methods as differences in reproductive strategies rather than \nin animal categories, as organisms within the same broad category, such as insects or fish, \ncan show huge variation in how they reproduce. This includes factors such as the location \nof embryonic development, the number of offspring produced per reproductive cycle, and \nthe amount of parental care invested in each offspring. sexual reproduction\u2002 the fusion \nof two distinct haploid gametes \nto produce a single diploid zygote \ncomposed of two sets  \nof chromosomes\nreproductive strategies\u2002  \nadaptations to reproduction that \nimprove the success of survival  \nof a species\nfertilisation\u2002 the process by which \ntwo gametes (such as sperm and \negg cells) fuse and form a zygote \nzygote\u2002 the diploid cell formed by \nthe combination of two haploid \ngamete cells \nIn lesson 7B , we covered \nmeiosis, which is used to \nproduce gametes in sexually \nreproducing organisms. \nMeiosis involves crossing over \nand independent assortment, \ntwo important processes \nwhich are essential to maintain \na high degree of genetic \ndiversity in a population. \nAnother important point \nof difference between \nreproductive strategies is the \nnumber of offspring produced \nper reproductive cycle, and the \namount of time and energy \ninvested into each individual \noffspring. This is considered  \nin detail in lesson 10C ,  \nwhich explains the difference \nbetween r-selection (quick  \nand many) and K-selection \n(slow and few).  OVIPARITY VS VIVIPARITY \u2013 HOW DOES THE EMBRYO DEVELOP?\nSexually reproducing animals can be classed as either oviparous or viviparous, which are distinguished \nby their mode of embryonic development.\nOviparity \u2013 eggs are released into the external \nenvironment and the embryo develops from \nnutrients inside the yolk. The organism grows  \nwith little development inside the mother.  \nFor most birds and insects, fertilisation occurs \ninside the mother, while most fish will release \nunfertilised eggs into the water to be fertilised \nexternally by free-flowing sperm (ovuliparity). \nshell\nembryoyolk (vitellus)\nImage: grayjay/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 5\u2002 In oviparous species, the embryo receives \nnutrients from the yolk.Viviparity \u2013 the embryo develops inside the \nmother\u2019s body and is born after a period of \ngestation.

Often, parental investment in offspring will extend well beyond birth in \nboth oviparous and viviparous species. For example, well over three-quarters of bird species receive \nextended care from both parents after hatching, and in many human cultures around the world parental \ninvestment often extends well into 20 years.ChApter 9: reprodu Ction  416\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

However, some organisms can reproduce without the fusion of gametes, \nand therefore do not require a mate. This method of reproduction is called  asexual \nreproduction , where the offspring or daughter cells are clones  of each other and of  \nthe parent.\nThe most common form of asexual reproduction is known as binary fission , which  \nwas covered in lesson 4A. This occurs most commonly in simple prokaryotic organisms  \nsuch as bacteria, though a similar form of binary fission also occurs in more complex \nmulticellular organisms such as polyps, where the organism splits into two equally sized \nclones (Figure 10). asexual reproduction\u2002 producing \noffspring without the fusion  \nof gametes\nclone\u2002 a genetically identical \norganism or section of DNA\nbinary fission\u2002 a type of  \nasexual reproduction where one \norganism divides into two  \nidentical organisms \nFigure 10\u2002 Though most common \nin unicellular prokaryotes, binary \nfission can also occur in some \nmulticellular organisms. SEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN PLANTS \u2013 ANGIOSPERMS \nIt is estimated that there are roughly 400 000 different \nspecies of plants currently known to science. Around 90%  \nof these are flowering plants ( angiosperms ), which \nreproduce via pollination . Pollination occurs when pollen \n(male gamete) is collected by the stigma of the flower and \nfuses with the ovule (female gamete). From here, the embryo \nthat develops will become a seed, which contains nutrients \nfrom which an immature plant can begin to grow into a new \nplant under the right conditions.\nPollen transfer in plants typically relies on a pollinator to move \nthe pollen from one plant to another. These pollinators can be:\n\u2022 biotic \u2013 living organisms such as insects or birds which are often attracted to the brightly coloured \npetals, inviting smell, and nutrient-rich nectar. \n\u2022 abiotic \u2013 non-living methods such as wind or water. This method allows the plant to focus on \nmaximising pollen dispersion rather than attracting pollinators. Such plants will often lack colourful \npetals and smells and will hang downwards to enable wind dispersion (Figure 9).\npollengrainspollenpollinator\npollenpollen\nstigma\novule pollination\nImage: BlueRingMedia/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 8\u2002 Pollination in sexually-\nreproducing plants\nImage: Jack Hong/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 7\u2002 Bees are attracted to \nflowers and act as biotic pollinators.\nangiosperms\u2002 flowering plants \nwith stems, roots, and leaves\npollination\u2002 a form of sexual \nreproduction in plants that involves \nthe fusion of pollen (male gamete) \nand ovule (female gamete) and \nleads to the production of seeds\nImage: torikell/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 9\u2002 The common catkin  \nhas evolved to maximise  \nwind dispersion.9A theor Y 417\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

This often leads to sexual \ncompetition amongst a population, where individuals adopt behaviours to help ensure their own reproductive success.  \nBasheer wanted to examine sexual competition in garden snails ( Cornu aspersum ) and took the following notes during  \na lecture he attended: \n\u2022 C. aspersum  are hermaphrodites, meaning that they function as both male and female during sexual reproduction.  \nThey are also promiscuous, and will mate multiple times with different partners to try and fertilise as many snails  \nas possible. \n\u2022 While mating, each snail will attempt to stab their partner with a sharp calcium dart covered in mucus. These darts  \nare not involved in sperm transfer, but are used instead to increase the reproductive chances of the snail.\n\u2022 Typically, only one of the snails will land a significant blow with their dart (the other missing). Once one snail \nsuccessfully stabs their partner, that snail can then insert their sperm and fertilise the other snail\u2019s eggs. \n\u2022 Successful dart shooting has been shown to double the amount of sperm stored by the recipient snail for potential \nfertilisation, and significantly increases the likelihood of paternity (being a father) for the shooting snail.\nBasheer hypothesised that the presence of mucus on the darts, rather than the darts themselves, increases a snail\u2019s chance  \nof impregnating another snail. To test this, he collected a group of adult C. aspersum snails from his garden and isolated them \nfor 50 days. From there, Basheer: \n\u2022 dipped the snails in 5% ethanol to anaesthetise them before removing their darts and mucus glands\n\u2022 extracted the mucus from the glands of each snail and froze until use 9A Q ueStion S 421\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

Of these, the most famous is Dolly the sheep, \nwho was the first mammal cloned using SCNT in 1997 . Despite the success of Dolly, \nSCNT is relatively new and still has much room for improvement. A few unsolved issues \nsurrounding the use and application of SCNT are discussed in Table 1.\ntable 1\u2002 Complications surrounding the use of SCNT\nComplication Description\nAnimal suffering SCNT attempts are often unsuccessful, producing non-viable embryos or resulting  \nin miscarriage during pregnancy. Even animals that survive to birth often suffer \nfrom severe developmental abnormalities, and the life expectancy of cloned animals \nis far shorter than non-cloned offspring. This is because the somatic cell nucleus \nmust be converted back into an embryonic state. However, as the somatic cell is \nfully differentiated, there would be varying degrees of epigenetic alterations and \nDNA damage, which must be cleared/reversed to match that of an embryonic state. \nUnfortunately, correct reprogramming rarely occurs, leading to the inefficient nature \nof SCNT and the potential for developmental abnormalities to arise. For example, \nresearchers took over 250 attempts to successfully clone Dolly. Therefore, some  \nhave argued against the use of SCNT due to its potential to inflict suffering on the \noffspring produced.\nHuman cloning Currently, the application of SCNT in humans is illegal in many countries, including \nAustralia. Arguments against SCNT in humans include opposition to the mass \ndestruction of egg cells and embryos from failed attempts, as well as issues \nsurrounding the unethical sourcing of eggs. \nPremature ageing Although sheep from the same species as Dolly typically survive for up to 12 years, \nDolly was euthanised after only 6 years when she developed a severe lung infection. \nDuring her lifetime, she also developed arthritis, a disease that becomes more \ncommon with old age, causing many scientists to proclaim that clones age at a greater \nrate due to the shortening of telomeres.\nWhile cloned animals do often appear to suffer from age-linked diseases, recent \nscience questions whether cloned animals actually do age at a greater rate than non-\ncloned animals.  \nIn addition to living and recently deceased animals, researchers are also investigating ways \nto revive extinct species through SCNT. For example, scientists attempted to revive the \nPyrenean ibex ( Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica ), which became extinct in 2000. Unfortunately \nthe clone only survived a few minutes after birth due to defects in its lungs. This attempt, \nand others like it, continue to spark debate over which extinct species should be cloned, \nand whether they should be cloned at all. enucleated\u2002 a cell that has had its \nnucleus removed or destroyed9B theo RY 427\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",
  "Page 439": "Embryo splitting\nTypically, after the successful fertilisation of an egg cell, the cell begins to divide, forming \nan embryo and then an entire organism. However, if an embryo is split during the early \nstages of embryonic development, each individual section will develop as an independent \nembryo, making it possible to produce two or more genetically identical offspring. While \nthis process naturally occurs in the production of identical twins in humans, embryos are \noften artificially split for agricultural applications. The split embryos are implanted into \nsurrogate mothers where embryonic development is completed, where each individual \nis genetically identical to the original embryo. Ideally, the splitting of the early embryo \noccurs when the cluster of cells is between 6\u20138 cells. During this stage, because cells are \nstill totipotent, they are capable of developing into viable embryos. \nFertilisation\nEarly embryo\nEmbryo splitting\nSurrogate mothers\nGenetically identical o\ufb00spring\nImage: SunshineVector/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 2\u2002 The process of embryo splitting\nApplications of embryo splitting\nIn agriculture, embryo splitting  is often conducted in combination with in-vitro  \nfertilisation  (IVF) where scientists can selectively choose eggs and sperm from parents \nwith desirable traits and fertilise them in a laboratory. For example, farmers may \nselectively choose cows (female) and bulls (male) based upon desirable traits, such as \nhigh milk production or increased muscle mass, and split the resulting embryo to produce \ngenetically identical offspring, all of which would have the desirable traits.

Therapeutic cloning involves the cloning of particular \ntissues for some medical benefit in humans, and is quickly showing promise as a replacement for \nconventional medical treatments such as organ transplants and skin grafts, and some applications could \neven involve the treatment of previously untreatable diseases. The main benefits of therapeutic cloning \nover conventional techniques are that as the tissues are genetic clones of a patient, there is little to no \nrisk of rejection, and tissues or organs may be manufactured quicker than the current waitlist for many \norgan transplants.  \nInstead of implanting the developing embryo into a surrogate mother, embryonic stem cells can be \nharvested from the developing embryo. From lesson 4D, we should remember that stem cells are \nundifferentiated cells that can differentiate into specialised cells. Therefore, embryonic stem cells, which \nare pluripotent stem cells, can develop into many different cell types. For example, when embryonic stem \ncells are treated with a derivative of vitamin A, they can differentiate into nerve cells.Chapte R 9: Rep Rodu Ction  428\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

  "Page 442": "Theory summary\nReproductive cloning technologies are human interventions that artificially produce \ngenetically identical clones of an organism. When clones are produced naturally, the \nprocess is instead known as asexual reproduction. \nThere are two main reproductive cloning technologies in animals: somatic cell nuclear \ntransfer and embryo splitting. Somatic cell nuclear transfer involves the transfer of a \nsomatic cell nucleus into an enucleated egg cell, which is subsequently implanted into a \nsurrogate mother to produce a cloned offspring. Embryo splitting involves the fertilisation \nof egg cells and the splitting of early embryonic cells to produce multiple cloned offspring. \nIn plants, there are three main reproductive cloning technologies: plant tissue culturing, \nplant cuttings, and plant grafting. Plant tissue culturing involves the growth of plant cells \nin a controlled environment, plant cutting involves the replanting of a leaf, stem or root, \nand plant grafting involves the attachment of a scion to a rootstock.\nDespite the success of animal reproductive cloning techniques, they are still complicated \nby ethical issues such as the suffering of animals, premature ageing, and the controversy \nsurrounding the potential for human cloning. Furthermore, animal and plant cloning may \nlead to a decrease in genetic diversity, leaving species and populations more susceptible to \ndisease, pests, and environmental change. \nResearchers working on the Lazarus Project are using somatic cell nuclear transfer in an attempt \nto resurrect the gastric-brooding frog. In doing so, they are transferring the genetic material from \npreserved gastric-brooding frogs into an enucleated egg cell obtained from a closely related species. \nUnfortunately, researchers are yet to produce an embryo that has survived more than a couple of \ndays, so you might have to wait a bit longer till you get to see a frog giving birth through its mouth!BANANAS\nPanama disease is a lethal fungal disease caused by Fusarium \noxysporum  which affects banana trees by interfering with the \nmovement of water within the xylem, leading to the wilting and \ndeath of entire banana plantations. The two races of F. oxysporum \nwhich are known to affect banana trees are \u2018Race 1\u2019 and \u2018Tropical \nRace 4\u2019 (TR4).\nUp until the 1950s, the main commercial banana sold was known \nas the Gros Michel banana. However, the appearance of \u2018Race 1\u2019 \ncompletely devastated banana plantations, prompting farmers \nto cultivate another species of banana known as Cavendish \nbananas, which can be found on every supermarket shelf today. \nHowever, recently, the emergence of \u2018Tropical Race 4\u2019 has begun \nto worry researchers who fear that history will repeat itself once \nagain. Currently, there are no effective pesticides or antifungals \nwhich can combat the infection. In 2015, TR4 reached Australia, \naffecting one of the largest banana plantations in Queensland\u2019s \nTully Valley, leading to the closure of the farm and destruction of \nall infected banana plants to prevent further transmission. Since \nthen, TR4 has reappeared multiple times. \nBut why are bananas so susceptible to disease? Because commercial bananas are seedless, they  \ncannot sexually reproduce and must instead be produced through reproductive cloning techniques. \nBanana trees can either be produced through tissue culturing or by dividing an existing banana tree \ninto many separate segments for planting. Therefore, virtually all Cavendish bananas grown today are \ngenetically identical, leaving them exceptionally vulnerable to disease. \nFigure 6\u2002 A banana tree affected by \nPanama disease9B theo RY 431\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

Populations with greater genetic diversity have a \nhigher chance of containing alleles that are better suited to survive new \nenvironmental challenges.\nSexual reproduction\nAdvantages Disadvantages\n\u2022 increases the genetic \ndiversity of a population  \nby allowing for  \nrecombinant offspring\n\u2022 improves disease resistance \nby promoting the presence \nof different alleles \n\u2022 combining the genetic \nmaterial from two gametes \nreduces the chances of \nan offspring inheriting a \ngenetic disorder that might \nbe carried by one parent. \u2022 the cost of male progeny\n\u2022 the time, energy, and  \nresources it takes to attract  \nand find a mate \n\u2022 the risk of transferable  \ndiseases associated with  \nsexual intercourse \n\u2022 the risk of losing offspring to \noutside influences such as \nembryo damage.\nAdvantages Disadvantages\n\u2022 grows faster than sexually \nreproducing populations\n\u2022 offspring are identical clones of the \nparent.

While this form of reproduction is advantageous \ndue to its speed and relative simplicity when compared with sexual \nreproduction, it does not increase genetic diversity.

In Australia, infertility affects 15 in 100 couples, with 40% of \ncases being attributed to problems with the male reproductive system, another 40% being attributed to problems with \nthe female reproductive system, and the remaining 20% either attributed to a combination of factors, or some unknown \ncause (Healthdirect, 2020). \nThe major components of the female reproductive system include \nthe Fallopian tubes, the ovaries, and the uterus.  \nEgg cells are produced in the ovaries, and are released into the \nFallopian tubes. The egg cell travels down the tube,  \nwhere it may come into contact with a sperm cell and be fertilised. \nThe fertilised egg continues travelling down the Fallopian tube, \neventually arriving in the uterus, where it implants into the lining \nof the uterus and continues developing into an embryo. In women, \ncommon causes of infertility include Fallopian tube damage or \nblockage, which can prevent the transportation of the egg. This can \ncause ovulation disorders where the release of eggs from the ovaries \nis abnormal, and primary ovarian insufficiency in which the ovaries \ncease to function normally, resulting in the decreased production of \negg cells and hormones. \nIn men, sperm are produced in the testes.

During IVF, egg cells are \nfertilised with sperm outside of the body, before being introduced into the mother\u2019s uterus to develop. As part of IVF, \nparents can often select against deleterious traits with genetic screening techniques. However, access to IVF can often \nbe limited to certain individuals due to both economic and judicial constraints.  \novary Fallopian\ntubeuterus\novary\nImage: BlueRingMedia/Shutterstock.com\nREVIEW437\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

In a 2019 inquiry into \nthese checks, patients described these checks as humiliating and unfair. While the state harboured good intentions, \nattempting to make sure that the child was raised in a suitable environment, opponents argued that couples were being \ndiscriminated against based on their fertility status as natural conception is largely unrestricted.

Examples of \ncommon seedless fruit include watermelons and grapes. These seedless variants can  \nbe produced through a phenomenon known as parthenocarpy, where fruit develops  \nwithout the fertilisation of the ovule. Stenospermocarpy is similar to parthenocarpy,  \nbut instead involves the abortion of the embryo as they develop in fruit, thereby  \ndisrupting the production of seeds. \nSeedless watermelons are produced by artificially breeding diploid and tetraploid watermelon together to produce \ntriploid watermelon. Because there are three sets of chromosomes, they won\u2019t pair correctly during meiosis.  \nThis prevents the formation of functional gametes, causing seedlessness. Conversely, some varieties of seedless  \ngrapes naturally arose from a random change in the gene responsible for seed development, inhibiting seed formation. \n10 Identify the male reproductive gamete in flowering plants. \u2002(1 MARK)\n11 Describe the reproductive process in flowering plants. \u2002(2 MARKS)\n12 Explain whether seedless watermelons produced by crossing diploid and tetraploid watermelon is a form  \nof stenospermocarpy. \u2002(2 MARKS)\n13 Explain why seedless grapevines must be propagated through reproductive cloning techniques. \u2002(1 MARK)\n14 Describe how plant tissue cultures could be used to produce seedless grapevines. \u2002(3 MARKS)\n15 Some plants can develop from spores released into the environment.

Abiotic factors are  \nproperties of the environment that are non-living and include temperature, water, nutrient \navailability, and acidity. On the flipside, biotic factors are properties of the environment \nthat are alive and include predator-prey interactions, plant-herbivore interactions, \ncompetition for resources, and symbiotic relationships. For example, coral reefs are \ncharacterised by tropical temperatures (abiotic) and the presence of corals, a type of \nanimal (biotic).\nOrganisms evolve adaptations to deal with the abiotic and biotic factors in their \nenvironment. For each factor, an organism will have a range of conditions within which it \nwill thrive, survive, or not-stay-alive (Figure 1).

Organisms exchange heat with their environment through \nradiation, conduction, and convection. They also produce their own metabolic heat \nand release heat via evaporation. Organisms obtain water by drinking, eating food, and \nmetabolic water production. They lose water through excretion and evaporative  \nwater loss (sweating).\nIn hot deserts, organisms have generally adapted to maximise heat loss, minimise heat \ngain, maximise water uptake, and minimise water loss.thermoregulation\u2002 the \nhomeostatic process of \nmaintaining a constant internal \nbody temperatureDon\u2019t think two abiotic factors are enough?

Maintaining a temperature balance prevents the animal from \noverheating. If the animal does overheat, many biochemical processes within the body \ncannot continue and the animal may die.\nInsulation\nThe more insulated an animal is, the harder it is for the animal to release heat into the \nenvironment. By the same logic, we can say that the less insulated an animal is, the easier \nit is to release heat into the environment. It should come as no surprise that many animals \nhave evolved the optimal thickness of fur and fat to regulate temperature. As many desert \nanimals release heat into the environment, a thin insulating layer is often preferable.\nTHE INSULATION TECHNIQUES OF CAMELS\nCamels are one of the best adapted and most widespread large desert animals on earth. They have \ndeveloped a simple yet effective insulating system to help them maintain a temperature balance. The top \nof the camel has a thick layer of fur and fat, which reduces the total amount of heat absorbed by the sun. \nThe underside of a camel consists of a very thin layer of fur and fat, such that they can effectively release \nlarge amounts of heat into the environment.\nImage: Chris Ison/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 3\u2002 A feral camel found in the Australian outback ChApTer 10: Ad ApTAT ions And surviv Al 444\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

In the desert a high SA:V \nratio may be beneficial if you release heat into a cold microclimate, but exposure to direct \nsunlight may quickly increase body temperature.

In the desert \na low SA:V ratio may be beneficial for an animal if it is exposed to direct sunlight or \ncannot avoid heat. However, animals with low SA:V ratios must still release waste heat. \nFor instance, the SA:V ratio of the African elephant\u2019s body is relatively low, allowing it to \nsurvive in direct sunlight with ease.

Endotherms include mammals, birds, and some fish whereas ectotherms \ninclude reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates.\nEndotherms spend a lot of energy producing metabolic heat, but in the desert they must \nevolve effective strategies to release excess heat. As ectotherms obtain heat from their \nenvironment, they can use the energy they don\u2019t spend generating metabolic heat on other \nprocesses, such as foraging for food or finding a mate. This is why we tend to find many \nectotherms in hot environments as permanently cold environments typically provide too \nlittle environmental heat for ectotherm survival.\nendotherm\u2002\nan animal that \nproduces the majority of its own \nheat via metabolic processes\nectotherm\u2002\nan animal that \nobtains heat primarily from the \nenvironment, rather than its own \nmetabolic heat\nTORPOR AND THE AUSTRALIAN WATER-HOLDING FROG\nT orpor\n is a physiological and behavioural adaptation for survival in which an animal\u2019s metabolic rate \nis severely reduced. It appears to be triggered by changes in the environment. Torpor has two major \nbenefits for an animal: little energy is required to fuel this state and prolonged torpor helps animals avoid \nextreme environmental conditions for extended periods of time.\nThe Australian water-holding frog uses a particular state of torpor, called \naestivation\n, to survive the hot \nand dry periods during the scorching summer months. It stores water in its body and creates a sealed \nburrow, where it begins aestivation. The Australian water-holding frog can live up to three years in this \nstate, only surfacing for brief periods following rain to reproduce.\nThe Australian water-holding frog\u2019s importance is not solely due to its interesting ability to survive \ndroughts. During times of water scarcity, the Aboriginal people of Australia would traditionally dig up \nthese frogs as a valuable source of food and water.\nFigure 7\u2002\nThe Australian water-holding frog\ntorpor\u2002\na physiological state in \nwhich the metabolism of an animal \nis reduced to conserve energy\naestivation\u2002\nprolonged torpor in \nresponse to hot and dry conditions\nCh\nA\np\nT\ner 10: Ad\nA\np\nTAT\nions \nA\nnd surviv\nA\nl\n446\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

Other sources of water include drinking \nthe dewfall that occurs at night, and the metabolic production of water during aerobic \ncellular respiration.\nIf you think back to lesson 2B, you should remember that six water molecules are \nproduced when one glucose molecule is broken down to produce ATP . Many desert \nanimals have adapted to survive entirely on the water they consume from food and the \nwater produced during aerobic cellular respiration \u2013 they never have to drink at all!\nDecrease water output\nAs you learned in lesson 5D, human urine contains urea, other waste products, and water. \nDesert mammals also urinate, but most excrete concentrated urine which contains \nvery little water. Typically, this is achieved with an extremely long loop of Henle in the \nnephron. Reptiles and birds use even less water by excreting uric acid with other wastes in \na semi-solid state. By excreting highly concentrated wastes, animals conserve water.\nHuman faeces are approximately 60% water. Unlike humans, desert animals cannot afford \nto lose water in their faeces. To compensate, desert animals have evolved highly complex \ndigestive systems which absorb the maximum amount of water and nutrients from the \nfood they ingest and the faeces they excrete. Consequently, the faeces of most desert \nanimals have low water content.\nEvaporative cooling\nAnimals release huge amounts of heat via the evaporation  of water, commonly known \nas evaporative cooling. Sweating and panting are both examples of evaporative cooling \nmethods. While the evaporation of water is an effective heat loss mechanism, it requires \nwater and may cause dehydration in arid environments.evaporation\u2002 the loss of heat via \nthe conversion of water from liquid \nto gas\u2018MOISTURE-HARVESTING\u2019 LIZARDS\nThe thorny devil belongs to a group of phenotypically similar, although genetically unrelated, \u2018moisture-\nharvesting\u2019 lizards.

The skin of the thorny devil is covered in tiny capillary-like channels that direct \nwater to the mouth of the lizard. If standing in an open water puddle or rain (an admittedly rare \noccurrence in the desert), water will travel up the legs and down the back into the mouth via capillary \naction. Thorny devils have been also observed drinking water from wet sand that they shovel onto their \nown back, and some scientists suggest that other moisture-harvesting lizards (such as Phrynocephalus \nhelioscopus ) may even be able to drink condensation from the air.\nImge: Kristian Bell/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 9\u2002 The thorny devil ( Moloch horridus )\nWant to read the study this is based on?

  "Page 459": "Evaporative cooling works because water has a high specific heat capacity and latent heat \nof vaporisation, which means that it takes a lot of energy to raise the temperature of water \nand to convert water into water vapour. Evaporative cooling cools you down because the \nheat from your body is removed when water evaporates.\nIn environments where the surface air and ground temperature is greater than an animal\u2019s \nskin temperature, the animal will always absorb heat via conduction, convection, and \nradiation. In this situation, evaporative cooling methods are the most effective method of \nheat loss. Alternatively, the animal could always move to an area with lower air and ground \ntemperatures and release heat via conduction, convection, radiation, and evaporative \ncooling methods.\nImage: horsemen/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 10\u2002 Horses and humans both sweat to lose heat via evaporative cooling.\nBehavioural adaptations\nIn the desert there are two general behavioural strategies demonstrated by animals:  \n1) evading  or 2) enduring . Evaders avoid extreme temperatures and endurers simply \nendure the harsh conditions. Evaders tend to consist of small to medium-sized animals, \nwhilst endurers are often larger animals like emus or camels.\nEvading extreme conditions\nTo avoid extreme temperatures many desert animals seek out shade or retreat to a burrow \nsystem. While the air temperature in and out of shade is nearly identical, in the shade you \ndo not absorb heat from solar radiation. Temperatures in burrow systems are less than the \ntemperature outside, and temperatures in the burrow rarely change during the hottest few \nhours of the day.\nHot and dry deserts have the largest percentage of nocturnal activity of any environment. \nThis behavioural adaptation is beneficial, as temperatures during the night are much lower \non average than during the day and water availability is higher.\nEnduring extreme conditions\nWhile endurers display greater resistance to environmental warming in high-temperature \nconditions, they still must release metabolic waste and absorbed heat into the environment \nin order to survive.\nFor instance, endurers tend towards inactivity during the hottest periods of the day, \nreducing detrimental metabolic heat production, and many dig small pits in which they \nsit down, releasing heat into the cooler soil via conduction. Additionally, while larger \nendurers are too large to retreat to burrow systems, often they will seek out shade \nunderneath larger trees.\nSome animals have evolved behaviours to promote heat loss by the evaporation of \nwater. During the heat of the day, kangaroos lick their arms (Figure 11), and many larger \nmammals (pigs, buffalo, elephants) wallow in mud or water baths. When the water \nevaporates from the skin, heat is removed from the body. Furthermore, as wallowing \nanimals use an external source of water for evaporative cooling their water balance \nremains largely unaffected.evaders\u2002 generally smaller animals \nthat modify their behaviours to \navoid extreme temperatures and \nhigh internal body temperatures\nendurers\u2002 generally larger  \nanimals that do not avoid  \nextreme temperatures\nFigure 11\u2002 Kangaroos have thick \nblood vessels below the skin in  \ntheir forearms.

  "Page 460": "THE BEHAVIOURS OF THE GREAT DESERT SKINK\nThe evolution of structural or physiological traits occurs slowly over multiple generations. Therefore, such \nadaptations rarely help organisms respond to rapidly changing environmental conditions. Behavioural \nadaptations are less rigid, as an animal may adapt these daily to suit their changing environment.\nMoore, Stow, and Kearney (2018) wanted to find out if rapid climate change would threaten the critically \nendangered great desert skink of central Australia. In their study, they looked at skink behaviour in \nresponse to surface temperature. Their results suggested that skinks would increase their activity at \ndusk, dawn, and night, and retreat to burrow systems whilst reducing their metabolic activity during peak \ntemperatures. The researchers concluded that while the effects of climate change would likely impact \nspecies survival indirectly, altering their burrowing, aversion, and foraging behaviours would help the \ngreat desert skinks survive.\nImage: Inavanhateren/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 12\u2002 The great desert skink of central Australia adapts to changing temperatures by modifying  \nits behaviours.\nDESERT ENDURERS, CATAGL YPHIS BOMBYCINA\nThe general rule of the desert is that small animals avoid the heat, whilst larger animals endure.  \nBut every rule has an exception, as shown by the Cataglyphis bombycina  (Saharan silver ant) of  \nsouthern Morocco.\nThese ants brave the biting sun and scorching sands reaching temperatures of over 70 \u00b0C during the peak \nof peak summer. Where most ants would immediately \u2018cook\u2019 upon leaving their nest, C. bombycina  have \nevolved a specific set of structural, physiological, and behavioural adaptations enabling them to endure \nthe extreme temperatures. For instance, their legs are longer than those of other ant species which raises \ntheir bodies off the ground and their bodies are covered in reflective hairs which reduces heat absorption. \nThey produce heat shock proteins to prevent protein denaturation and promote enzyme reactions at high \ntemperatures, and they climb on sticks when the ground temperatures become too high.\nBut why have the ants evolved to last in such high temperatures? A review article by Boulay et al. (2017) \nsuggests C. bombycina  forages at high temperatures to avoid the effects of interspecies competition for \nresources, and to avoid predation by less thermotolerant vertebrates.\nImage: Pavel Krasensky/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 13\u2002 Saharan silver ants ( C. bombycina ) have numerous structural, physiological, and behavioural \nadaptations which allow them to deal with temperatures up to 70 \u00b0C.10A T heor Y 449\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

In hot environments, this usually requires the plant \nto limit heat absorption to limit temperature increases. Three common strategies to limit \nheat absorption include:\n\u2022 having lightly coloured or reflective leaves (or photosynthetic organs )\n\u2022 producing leaves of smaller surface area\n\u2022 orienting their leaves vertically to minimise the surface area exposed to the sun.\nFigure 14\u2002 The saltbush ( Atriplex nummularia ) has white-coloured leaves to minimise heat absorption.\nIncreasing water uptake\nPlants get the vast majority of their water by absorbing water through their roots. Due to \nthe little precipitation in the desert, many long-living desert plants have extensive deep \nroot systems capable of reaching groundwater reserves. Other desert plants spread roots \nhorizontally to absorb the maximum amount of surface water during the brief periods of \nrain, and store this water for later use.\nsoil(b)\n(a)groundwater\nImage: alazur/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 16\u2002 Many desert plants have (a) deep root systems capable of reaching underground water reserves and \nothers (b) spread roots horizontally to catch water during infrequent periods of rain.\nFigure 15\u2002 The desert oak \n(Allocasuarina decaisneana )  \nof central Australia has vertically \nhanging photosynthetic stems. \nThese stems take the place  \nof leaves.photosynthetic organs\u2002 the  \nmacro structures that are \nthe site of photosynthesis in \nplants, including leaves and \nphotosynthetic branchesChApTer 10: Ad ApTAT ions And surviv Al 450\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",
  "Page 462": "Water storage\nTo increase the availability of water, rather than developing highly complex root  \nsystems to gain water all year round, some plants collect huge amounts of water  \nduring the rainy season and store this water for use in the dry season. For example, \nbaobabs store large reserves of water in a hollow trunk and cacti store water in cells  \nin their stems or underground.\nMinimising water loss\nA large part of reducing the rate of water loss to the environment in plants is by reducing \nthe rate of water lost through the stomata  during the day. Plants can minimise this by \nreducing their stomatal density, by using sunken stomata that produce pockets of humid \nair (Figure 18), or by maintaining a humid environment around the leaf by folding or \nrolling their leaves (Figure 19).\nStomata are regulated by guard cells . During the hottest parts of the day, when the water \nloss to transpiration is highest, the guard cells lose water and turgor pressure within the \ncell drops. Consequently, the guard cells become flaccid and the stomata close, preventing \nthe exchange of gases with the environment (Figure 20).\nFigure 18\u2002 By placing their stomata at the bottom of a pit, plants maintain a humid environment around their  \nstomata which limits the rate of water loss to the environment.\nFigure 19\u2002 The European marram grass ( Ammophila arenaria ) has rolled leaves to reduce water loss.\nguard cells\nImage: W.Y.

Eucalypts have developed three general strategies to not only \ndeal with fire but also to directly benefit from it. These strategies are:\n\u2022 post-fire growth via epicormic buds \u2013 these buds are protected by thick layers of bark during fires, \nand quickly sprout epicormic shoots after a fire. This allows eucalypts to regenerate much quicker \nafter a fire than many competing species.\n\u2022 post-fire lignotuber growth \u2013 lignotubers are masses of high-energy reserves which are found in the \nroots of many eucalypt species. When the above-ground component of the tree is severely damaged \nduring a fire, sprouts quickly form from the lignotuber, supporting rapid regeneration after a fire.\n\u2022 post-fire germination \u2013 sometimes, intense fires will completely wipe out every plant species in an \narea. Some eucalypt species have adapted so that their seeds open up and release during intense \nheat, germinating within days of the fire. As very few other species are growing during this period, \nthe eucalypt seedlings experience very little interspecies competition for resources, which allows the \neucalypt species to dominate.\nNot only are eucalypts adapted to deal with fire, but their highly flammable barks, leaves, and oils can \nactually promote the intensity and frequency of fire.\nImage: Daria Nipot/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 21\u2002 Rejuvenation from epicormic shoots\nImage: Daria Nipot/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 22\u2002 Rejuvenation from subterranean lignotubersChApTer 10: Ad ApTAT ions And surviv Al 452\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

However, this intervention \nmay not save woolly monkeys, as only 26% of reintroduction programs worldwide successfully \nestablish self-sustaining populations (Fischer & Lindenmayer, 2000).\nThis low success rate is attributed to living conditions that rarely reflect the wilderness.

Such insulation is usually composed of thick fur, plumage,  \nor subdermal fat to provide maximum protection against heat release into the environment.\nSurface area to volume ratio\nAn animal\u2019s surface area to volume ratio can severely impact the rate of heat transfer \nboth into and out of a body. By reducing their surface area to volume ratio, an animal will \nrelease heat slowly, increasing the time it takes for body temperature to drop.

Consider both SA:V and insulation.\nPhysiological adaptations\nEndotherms versus ectotherms\nWe tend to find a greater proportion of endotherms, rather than ectotherms, in  \ncold environments. This is because animals cannot obtain heat (e.g. via convection,  \nconduction, etc.) from an environment with a lower temperature than their body, so \nmaintaining a stable body temperature via internal metabolic processes is typically \nadvantageous. Given that the body temperature of ectotherms generally matches that  \nof the ambient temperature, cold-adapted ectotherms must be able to tolerate extremely \nlow temperatures.\nMany cold-adapted animals will burrow underground during the coldest months of the \nyear, where the temperature remains just above freezing. Once the temperature rises \nduring the summer, these animals will return to the surface to feed and breed.\nTorpor\nIn lesson 10A, you learned about one kind of torpor , aestivation. There are actually two \nother kinds of torpor, hibernation  (in endotherms) and brumation (in ectotherms), both \nof which are triggered by seasonal drops in temperature. Hibernation and brumation \nhelp an animal survive extended periods in a state of low metabolic activity and body \ntemperature.

In a cold environment the circulatory \nsystem is equally critical, only here, adaptations to the circulatory system conserve heat \nrather than releasing it. As blood is pumped out of the heart it is the same temperature as \nthe animal\u2019s core body temperature. If blood of this temperature were to circulate to the \nperipheries, the temperature gradient between the body and the environment would be \nquite large, causing lots of heat to be lost. There are two main ways to prevent heat loss \nfrom blood: vasoconstriction and countercurrent circulation.\nThe opposite of vasodilation, \nvasoconstriction\n, occurs when the diameter of small blood \nvessels in the skin and overall blood flow is reduced. When many animals are required \nto conserve heat, the body sends signals to constrict these blood vessels and heat loss is \nminimised (Figure 5).\nVasoconstriction - to conserve heat\nheat loss\nacross\nepidermis\nVasodilation - to release heat\nepidermis\nair\nFigure 5\u2002\nAnimals can conserve heat by the vasoconstriction of superficial blood vessels.\nvasoconstriction\u2002\nthe narrowing of \nblood vessels\nPYGMY POSSUMS AND THE AUSTRALIAN ALPS\nThe mountain pygmy possum (\nBurramys parvus\n) is a tiny marsupial, on average weighing only 40 g, and \nis the only marsupial restricted entirely to the alpine and subalpine regions of south-eastern Australia. \nThe mountain pygmy possum is one of Australia\u2019s only hibernating marsupials, and they are able to \nsubject themselves to seven months of yearly torpor.\nDuring hibernation, mountain pygmy possums burrow beneath a thick layer of insulating snow. In this \nstate their resting metabolic rate drops drastically and their internal body temperature is able to fall as \nlow as 2 \no\nC without causing damage. Once the environmental temperature begins to rise in early spring, \nthe mountain pygmy possum will resurface to feed and breed.\nThe species was known only from fossils and was believed to be extinct until a live individual was \ndiscovered on Mount Hotham, Victoria in 1966. Considered critically endangered, only 2 000 of these \npossums are left in the wild.

Additionally, the \nformation of ice crystals within the cell can rupture cell membranes and other cell \ncontents, and the vascular system of plants cannot transport nutrients when blocked  \nby ice.\nHow to prevent freezing\nAt low temperatures, cell membrane fluidity decreases, which can quickly lead to \ndisruption of the lipid bilayer, decreased membrane protein effectiveness, and cell \ncontents leaking out. To deal with this, many cold-adapted plants modify the lipid  \nand chemical composition of their cell membranes to increase their functioning in  \nlow temperatures.\nThe freezing point of distilled water is 0 oC. As the concentration of solutes increases,  \nthe lower the freezing point becomes. Plants use this phenomenon to their advantage.  \nWhen the temperature drops, plant cells receive signals to increase the concentration of \nsolutes such as glucose in their cells, which increases a plant cell\u2019s resistance to freezing.\nIn addition, particular cold-adapted plants can produce antifreeze proteins in response \nto cold temperatures.

Over time the population \nsize may change, but there are limits as to how many individuals an environment can \nsupport and sustain.

Components that alter \na population\u2019s size include the total births and deaths within a population and any \nimmigration  or emigration  between populations.

For example, greater disease prevalence within a population may lead to an increase \nin deaths, and less resource availability may cause more emigration.

For \nexample, if we\u2019re trying to fit \n100 adults on a bus it\u2019s going \nto be much less comfortable \nthan 100 toddlers on a bus. \nTherefore, we can fit more \nseats on the toddler bus \n(greater carrying capacity) \ncompared to the adult bus.r AND K REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGIES\nThe population growth rate of reproducing organisms is influenced by the amount of offspring produced \nby an individual or pair of individuals in each generation. \nFor organisms that live in very unstable environments, it might be better to produce a larger number of \nshort-living offspring and let them take their chances in the hopes of some surviving until reproductive \nage. For organisms that live in stable environments, a better strategy might be to produce fewer offspring \nbut invest more resources in each individual to proactively increase their life-spans and chances of \nsurvival until adulthood. This is what biologists have coined the r/K reproductive strategies. However, it \nis important to note that r/K reproductive strategies exist on a spectrum. Therefore, you can say that a \nspecies is more \u2018K-selected\u2019 or more \u2018r-selected\u2019 when compared to another species. \nr-selection\nOften referred to as the \u2018quick and many\u2019 strategy, this method involves producing large numbers of \noffspring more regularly, while placing little or no parental care into each offspring. This typically leads \nto a higher mortality rate. Species who employ the r-selection strategy will reach sexual maturity quickly, \nand will become self-sufficient adults earlier than other organisms. Population growth in r-strategists is \noften boom and bust, where large explosions in the population are often followed by a massive die off.\nMany aquatic animals, insects, and rodents are more r-selected.\nK-selection \nOften referred to as the \u2018slow and few\u2019 method, this method involves producing much smaller numbers \nof offspring, which are often much larger in size and more dependent on parental care. Species who \nemploy the K-selection strategy will reach sexual maturity much slower, and will therefore breed later \nin their lifespan than other organisms. Population growth in K-strategists will remain constant at the \ncarrying capacity of an environment.\nMost mammals, including humans, chimpanzees, whales, and elephants are generally more K-selected.\nrat frog tuna oyster\n500 000 000\no\ufb00spring\nper year6 000\no\ufb00spring\nper year200 o\ufb00spring\nper year40 o\ufb00spring\nper year2 o\ufb00spring\nper year2.5 o\ufb00spring\nin a lifetimer Khuman puma\nFigure 2\u2002 r/K selection theory represents a trade off between producing either many cheap offspring, or few \nexpensive offspring.Cha PTer 10: adaPTaTIons and surv Ival  478\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",
  "Page 490": "Population distribution\nThe population distribution  of a species refers to its geographical spread across different \nareas. The population distribution is limited by the ideal habitat of a species and its ability \nto tolerate different environments. Distributions over larger areas are often represented by \ncoloured areas on a map (Figures 3 & 4).\nINDONESIA\nAUSTRALIACoral\nsea\nTasman\nsea\nFigure 3\u2002 The red kangaroo ( Macropus rufus ) can be found \nin most of the hot and arid regions of central Australia. \nEstimates suggest that as many as 50 million red \nkangaroos range across the continent.Melbourne\nGeelong\nFigure 4\u2002 The critically endangered leadbeater\u2019s \npossum ( Gymnobelideus leadbeateri ) survives in \ntwo distinct populations north-east of Melbourne. \nEstimates suggest only 2 000\u201311 250 individuals \nremain in the wild.\nThe population distribution of individuals within a local area can be a uniform, random, \nor clumped arrangement (Figure 5). The reasons for a species to be distributed a certain \nway varies between species. For example, one species distribution may be clumped as \nindividuals distribute around pools of resources but another species distribution may be \nuniform as individuals require a large amount of space. Over time, distributions are not \nstatic and will change due to environmental factors such as temperatures, rainfall, invasive \nspecies, and habitat loss.\nPopulation density\nThe population density  of a species refers to the number of individuals found in a \ngiven area, such as individuals per square kilometre. While this may seem like a simple \ncalculation, it proves extremely useful when predicting population growth rates and the \ncarrying capacity for a particular species. \nIt is easy to recognise how population density could influence the rate at which population \nsize increases. For example, dense populations would use up the available resources in an \necosystem more quickly than less dense populations.\nMany biotic and abiotic factors can influence the rate of births, deaths, immigration, and \nemigration in a population. Some of these factors influence populations in the same way, \nregardless of their population density. For example, the rainfall of an area will impact a \nhigh-density population in the same way as a low-density population. However, other \nfactors such as disease will have a more intense influence as population density increases. \nWe refer to these types of factors as density-independent  and density-dependent factors :\n\u2022 Density-independent factors \u2013 properties of the environment that are unaffected as \ndensity changes, such as climate. The same density-independent factor will have the \nsame effect on two populations of different densities. \n\u2022 Density-dependent factors \u2013 properties of the environment that change with the \ndensity of a species, such as the availability of resources.

Different species have different \nrequirements in terms of what they need from their environment to be able to survive. \nBecause of this, different species have different carrying capacities within the same \nenvironment (Figure 7).\nPopulation size\nTime\nKey\nCarrying capacityS-shaped = density\ndependent and\nindependent factors\n2004006008001000 exponential\n= unrestrained \npopulation growth\nFigure 6\u2002 The effect of density-independent and  \ndensity-dependent factors\nPopulation size\nTime2004006008001000\nSpecies 1\nSpecies 2\nKey\nSpecies 1 carrying capacity\nSpecies 2 carrying capacity\nFigure 7\u2002 Population growth rates for different species \nare limited by their individual species requirements \nand carrying capacities.\nInteractions between species \u20022.2.6.3\nOverview\nAn ecosystem is composed of a complex network of interactions and interdependencies \nbetween species. Interactions between two species can have beneficial, neutral, or \nnegative impacts on one or both species. \nTheory  details\nIn ecosystems, many species share habitats and interact with each other in a variety of \nways. It is no stretch of the imagination to say that currently there is not a single species \non Earth that exists completely independently. Several different types of symbiotic  \ninteractions between organisms exist, including mutualism, commensalism, amensalism, \nand parasitism. Additionally, predation and competition are two types of interactions that \ngreatly influence ecosystem structure. \nMutualism (+/+)\nA mutualistic  relationship exists between individuals that both benefit from interacting \nwith each other. For example, the dazzling arrays of colours in a coral reef are not caused \nby the coral themselves, but from photosynthetic algae living inside coral tissue. The algae \nproduce glucose and oxygen for the coral, and the coral gives the algae a safe place to live \n(Figure 8). Both organisms end up better off as a result of the symbiosis compared to if \nthey did not interact at all. symbiosis\u2002 an interaction  \nbetween two organisms of \ndifferent species living in close \nproximity to each other\nmutualism\u2002 interactions between \ntwo organisms of different species \nwhere both parties experience \nsome overall benefitCha PTer 10: adaPTaTIons and surv Ival  480\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",
  "Page 492": "Commensalism (+/0)\nCommensalism  describes interactions between two or more different organisms  of \ndifferent species where one gains some benefit while the other experiences no significant \nbenefit or harm. While theoretically possible, examples of true commensalism are rare in \nnature. For example, one classic example describes the relationship between cape buffalo \nand cattle egrets (which are a type of bird). These birds follow herds of buffalo around the \nsavannah, feeding off insects that are stirred up out of the grass by the buffalo, benefiting \nfrom the relationship. While they seemingly have no effect on the buffalo themselves, \ncloser investigation reveals that egrets often feed on ticks attached to buffalo, and may \ninadvertently warn buffalo when predators approach (a mutualistic relationship).\nPredation (+/\u2013)\nPredation describes interactions between two or more organisms of different species \nwhere one organism (the predator) hunts and kills another organism (the prey) for food. \nThe predator receives the benefit of obtaining food, whilst the prey has the obvious \ndownside of being killed and eaten. In response, many prey species have evolved \nadaptations to evade their predators. For example, camouflage is an evolutionary \nadaptation that enables prey species to blend into their environment, making it more \ndifficult for predators to detect them. Conversely, predators have evolved adaptations to \nbe able to hunt their prey more effectively. For example, they often have \u2018weapons\u2019 such as \nclaws and teeth, or better eyesight to distinguish their prey from the environment. commensalism\u2002 interactions \nbetween two organisms of \ndifferent species where one gains \nsome benefit while the other \nexperiences no significant benefit \nor harm\npredation\u2002 interactions between \ndifferent species where one \norganism hunts and kills another \norganism for food\nImage: Timothy Baxter/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 8\u2002 Coral reefs are ecological \nhotspots for mutualisms and  \nother complex interactions  \nbetween species.\nImage: Nicola_K_photos/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 9\u2002 Is the relationship \nbetween cape buffalo and cattle \negrets commensal or mutualistic? \nTurns out \u2018it\u2019s complicated.\u2019PREDATOR-PREY RELATIONSHIPS\nLife in a boreal forest during the 18th and 19th centuries of northern Ontario, Canada, was particularly \ndifficult. Especially considering that one of the main sources of food and fur, the snowshoe hare, would \nseemingly disappear once every ten years. While the disappearances were easy to predict, the reasoning \nbehind them was not as well known. That is until Charles J. Krebs and crew decided to take it upon \nthemselves to answer this question, and study the hare and its natural predator \u2013 the lynx.\nTo establish an explanation, Krebs et al. (1995) used multiple 1 km2 blocks of undisturbed boreal forest. \nEach block was split into four different experimental groups: 1) supplemented with food sources for the \nhare, 2) supplemented with a fertiliser, 3) excluded lynx via an electric fence, and 4) excluded lynx and \nreceived supplementary food. Additionally, blocks that received no food, fertiliser, and were accessible to \nlynx were also established.\nWhen testing snowshoe hare populations in each block, the researchers found that a) fertiliser \ntreatments barely affected hare populations, b) that independently, both the supplementary food and \nlynx exclusion treatments drastically increased hare populations, and c) that combining lynx exclusion \nand supplementary food treatment supported the highest number of snowshoe hares. \nKrebs et al. (1995) published their landmark paper which experimentally proved that snowshoe hare \npopulation cycles were heavily impacted by the availability of resources and predation by the native lynx. \nFurther research has gone on to prove snowshoe hare population cycles are mirrored by that of the lynx.\n185004080120\n369160\n1875\nYearHare population size (in thousands)\nLynx population size (in thousands)Key\n1900 1925LynxSnowshoe hare\nFigure 10\u2002 Cycles in the predator-prey relationships between snowshoe hare and lynx populations\nWant to read the studies this is based on?

When two organisms compete for the same limited resource, \nthe availability of the resource in the environment decreases. Therefore, two competing \norganisms must invest more in obtaining the limited resource, which has a negative effect \non each organism, and by extension a negative effect on both species.

The skin of the golden dart frog secretes a lethal batrachotoxin, \nwith each frog thought to contain enough of this toxin to kill between 10\u201320 fully grown adult humans. \nInterestingly, rather than synthesising these toxins themselves, many believe that the frogs obtain the \ntoxin from the food they eat, likely a particular species of beetle. The strength of the batrachotoxin \nis often considered \u2018overkill\u2019, as only the tiniest amount would kill most potential predators. Only \none species is known to be able to tolerate the toxins of the golden dart frog \u2013 the fire-bellied snake \n(Leimadophis epinephelus ). In fact, due to this tolerance, L. epinephelus  is thought to be the only natural \npredator of the golden dart frog. \nThis has led to many evolutionary biologists describing their relationship as an \u2018evolutionary arms race\u2019, \nwhere the frog has evolved deadlier toxins, and the snake has evolved greater resistance against the toxins.  \nImage: Thorsten Spoerlein/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 11\u2002 The golden dart frog ( Phyllobates terribilis )\nFigure 12\u2002 Parasitic wasps hatch, \nfeed, and grow inside  \nlive caterpillars.\nImage: Donna White/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 13\u2002 Ungulates, such as cattle, \nsheep, and deer, trample shrubs and \ngrasses while receiving no benefit \nor harm.

Within any given ecosystem, there are certain species \nthat play a disproportionately large role in maintaining this structure. These species are \nknown as keystone species . As such, removing a keystone species typically has a larger \neffect than the removal of other species.\nHowever, because the removal of any species has an effect on the ecosystem, and because \nno one truly knows where the line is drawn between a keystone species and a regular \nspecies, keystone species are generally hard to identify. Fortunately, we tend to find that \nkeystone species adopt the same sorts of roles within an ecosystem. Two common roles \nthat keystone species fulfill are apex predators  and ecosystem engineers . \nApex predators\nWithin ecosystems, certain predators will sit at the \u2018top of the food chain\u2019 as they have no \nnatural predators. These top predators are referred to as apex predators. Apex predators \nare responsible for controlling the numbers of their prey and, subsequently, the number of \nmany other organisms within an ecosystem. To illustrate this, let\u2019s look at an example. \nThe great white shark ( Carcharodon carcharias ) is an apex predator in its ecosystem. The \nsharks prey upon sea lions, seals, and large species of fish, keeping their populations at a \nhealthy number. Because the sharks are responsible for controlling sea lion numbers, we \ncan therefore say that they are responsible for controlling the numbers of what the sea \nlion eats (e.g. medium-sized fish species). Because of this, we can say that the sharks are \nresponsible for controlling the numbers of what the medium-sized fish eats (e.g. smaller-\nsized fish species), and so on. \nAs a result, the great white sharks are responsible for keeping the intricate ocean \necosystem in balance. If great white sharks were to be removed, their prey species like sea \nlions would lose a major predator and be free to increase in population size. This would \nimpact the numbers of medium fish that the sea lions prey on, disrupting the balance of \nthe ecosystem. Additionally, we can say that the sharks are also responsible for keeping \npopulations of prey physically and genetically healthy. They achieve this by removing the \nweaker, older individuals that are easier to catch. Given their immense impact on their \necosystem, we can classify great white sharks as a keystone species. \nEcosystem engineers\nEcosystem engineers interact with and significantly alter the physical environment of \ntheir ecosystem. The greater bilby ( Macrotis leucura ) is an ecosystem engineer within the \nAustralian environment. Whilst foraging for food, the bilby digs many small pits in the soil. keystone species\u2002 a species \nwhose effects on an ecosystem are \ngreater than expected relative to \nits population size\napex predator\u2002 a predator that has \nno natural predators and is at the \ntop of its food chain\necosystem engineer\u2002  \nan organism that creates, \nsignificantly alters, or maintains \nthe structure of an environment\nImage: Sergey Uryadnikov/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 15\u2002 Great white sharks are \napex predators and a keystone \nspecies in their ecosystem.\nFigure 16\u2002 The greater bilby is an \necosystem engineer within its \necosystem.10C T heor Y 483\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

Over the next 70 years, as a direct result of the removal of grey \nwolves from the ecosystem, a rapid increase in the population size of the wolves\u2019 main prey \u2013 elk ( Cervus \ncanadensis ) \u2013 occurred, leading to the intense grazing and trampling of vegetation. Because of this, the \necosystem suffered and human efforts to control elk populations were futile.\nIn 1995, a small number of wolves were reintroduced into the park and their impact was profound. \nWhile the direct impact of the wolves was the hunting and lowering of elk numbers, there were many \nmore indirect impacts. The presence of the wolves changed the behaviour of the elk, causing them to \navoid dangerous areas. In these areas, trees and other vegetation rapidly grew and increased, and this \ncatalysed many more changes: \n\u2022 Birds began to move into the newly forested areas, as did beavers. \n\u2022 The new dams constructed by beavers provided habitats for otters, ducks, fish, reptile, and \namphibian species. \n\u2022 The wolves also hunted coyotes in the park. Fewer coyotes lead to greater numbers of rabbits and \nmice, which then lead to more hawks, weasels, foxes, and badgers.\n\u2022 Raven and bald eagle numbers increased to scavenge the carrion left by the wolves. Greater amounts \nof carrion and berry trees also caused an increase in bear numbers. \n\u2022 The bears also hunted the elk, reducing their numbers further and reinforcing the positive impacts of \nreduced elk. \nAs the forest regenerated, the banks of rivers stabilised \nand collapsed less often due to the presence of vegetation. \nThe rivers became fixed in their path, channels narrowed, \nand more pools formed, providing more habitat \nopportunities. Impacts stemming from the return of a \nkeystone species are clear. This scenario is an example of \nwhat\u2019s known as a trophic cascade \u2013 an ecological process \nthat starts at the apex predator and tumbles all the way \ndown the food chain.\nImage: Agnieszka Bacal/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 17\u2002 Grey wolves are a keystone \nspecies in the Yellowstone National Park.Check out Scientific \nInvestigation 10.1 to put  \nthis into action!10C T heor Y 485\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

Some ecologists \nbelieve that up to one hundred native species could have been pushed towards extinction, and that upwards of a billion \nanimals in total could have died as a result of the fires. What\u2019s more, for those species who managed to survive extinction, a \nsubsequent lack of food, shelter, and breeding grounds continue to put them at risk. \nA particularly devastating effect of the bushfires was the large quantities of eucalyptus trees that were destroyed, whose \nhollows housed many species of birds. While the eucalypts themselves weren\u2019t affected by the nesting habits of hollow-\ndwelling birds, a lack of hollows will ensure those birds suffer immensely. Such trees may take years, or even decades, to return \nto a state capable of supporting wildlife again.\nEntomologists, people that study insects, would argue that the number of species pushed towards extinction by the fires was \nmuch larger than previous estimates.

Indigenous Ways of Knowing \nhave been generated through the processes of questioning, observation, investigation, \nexperimentation, and application that have been repeated across generations for \nthousands of years \u2013 similar to the way Western science has developed. The knowledge \ngenerated through these processes has allowed Indigenous people to survive in Australia \nfor over 60 000 years, making Australian Aboriginal culture the oldest existing human \nculture on earth (Figure 1). \nImage: Little Adventures/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 1\u2002 Australian Aboriginal art is the oldest unbroken form of art in the world and takes many forms.

  "Page 505": "Theory  details\nOne key way that Indigenous Australians have contributed to our understanding of \nAustralian ecosystems is through their utilisation of fire to maintain Country . Country is  \nthe physical place and all the animals, plants, and people that live there, not just now, \nbut in the past and in the future. Furthermore, Country also encompasses the spiritual \nmeaning and feelings of deep connection and attachment associated with that area for a \ncommunity and an individual. For Indigenous people, Country is a living thing and the \nlanguage that is used when describing Country reflects this. For example, they consider \nCountry that is managed well to be \u2018healthy\u2019 Country, and that poorly managed Country to \nbe \u2018sick\u2019 and needs human intervention to bring it back to good health. \nIt is believed that when Indigenous Australian people first arrived in Australia over \n60 000 years ago, the continent was already drying \u2013 that is, rainfall was decreasing \nand temperatures were increasing. As a result, much of the vegetation was changing \nfrom rainforest and grassland towards more arid and semi-arid woodlands and forests \ndominated by Eucalyptus  plants. In this more fire-prone environment, pyrophilic  plant \nspecies came to dominate. Wild bushfires occurred frequently and, as a result, many of \nthese plants adapted to tolerate fire and heat \u2013 many species in the Eucalyptus  genus have \nevolved to produce epicormic shoots  after fires and have developed seeds that survive the \nintense heat generated by bushfires (Figure 2). \nImage: Pru Sanderson/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 2\u2002 Epicormic shoots can be seen growing here on this Eucalyptus  tree after a bushfire in Marysville, Victoria. \nIn order to live in this arid environment, Aboriginal Australians had to understand these \nadaptations and learn how to use fire to control and stimulate plant growth to their \nadvantage. They utilised fire in a variety of ways, including to clear shrubs from grasslands \nand woodlands, promote various species of plants, and to break up Country and therefore \nreduce the intensity and extent of wildfires (i.e. generating fire breaks). This type of \nburning preserved the canopy of trees, which is important as it provides both shade and \nfood for animals as well as protection that can be used to escape from the fire below. It also \nreduces the amount of carbon released by the fire, as tree canopies release large amounts \nof carbon when they burn. \nPlants stimulated to grow by fire served as food for both grazing animals and Indigenous \nAustralians themselves \u2013 many plants that grew as a result of this practice were used by \nAboriginal people as food, including the Vanilla Lily Arthropodium milleflorum  (Figure 3) .\nIf you\u2019re planning on burning land, however, you need somewhere you and all the animals \ncan go so you don\u2019t get burned yourself! Indigenous Australians, therefore, would burn in \nsmall patches and let other areas regenerate for cover. These sorts of burnings often would \nstimulate a wide variety of seeds in the soil to sprout, as well as removing shrubs and old, \nwoody plants that interfered with the growth of plants eaten by animals. Additionally, \nsome woody plants cease to produce flowers when they are over 12 years old so burning \nthese away provides space for new, flowering growth to develop, benefiting animals such \nas nectar-eating possums and birds.

  "Page 506": "Whilst the exact fire management behaviours varied from region to region throughout \nAustralia, there were nevertheless some common characteristics. Aboriginal managers \nwould walk Country and were able to see where fire was needed, using it appropriately \nto address any issues they discovered. The type of findings that might have triggered a \ndecision to burn include the presence of: \n\u2022 long, dry grass\n\u2022 a large amount of leaf litter on the ground\n\u2022 dead standing shrubs \n\u2022 choked and impassable areas \n\u2022 fire hazards around camps, paths, and areas of fire-sensitive vegetation like rainforest. \nThe fires created under Aboriginal management were smaller, more frequent, and less \ndamaging than wild bushfires (Figure 4). Because of this, they\u2019re often referred to as \u2018cool \nburns.\u2019 These fires resulted in an overall reduction in fuel loads in the ecosystem, meaning \nthat wild bushfires became less intense, preserving important and limited ecosystem \ncomponents such as habitat trees and hollows.\nIndigenous fire management, therefore, actually promoted local biodiversity, resulting in \nthe creation of a complex patchwork of different vegetation types. This fire mosaic  was \nsignificantly more varied and created an environment that was safe from out of control, \nintense heat-producing bushfires, allowing the growth of various plants and animal foods \n(Figure 5). \nThis form of fire management contrasts with current \u2018hazard reduction burns\u2019 that \nare conducted widely across Australia in preparation for bushfire season.

Young Indigenous \npeople are taught about fire management by practical instruction and observation, \nlearning from Dreamtime  stories and ancestors who show the right way to take care \nof Country using fire, and the dangers and responsibilities of those engaging in fire \nmanagement practices (Figure 6). \nIn Victoria, there has recently been a push for greater Indigenous involvement in our \nplanning and management of bushfire season. It is becoming increasingly clear that \nIndigenous knowledge about fire and how to maintain a flourishing ecosystem in an \nincreasingly fire-prone environment is valuable as we experience longer, more intense \nbushfire seasons due to the consequences of climate change.

They are also \nthe most easily confused, and live in a constant state of b\u2026emusement. \nThe emu is the largest bird in Australia, and eats a diet primarily consisting of fruit and \nseed plants. Like many other birds, emus swallow their food whole and then process it \nalong their digestive tract, including in the gizzard where rocks and grit help to break up \nconsumed matter. These digested materials are then excreted as faeces. As emus can travel \nup to 25 km per day, many plants have developed a mutualistic  relationship with emus, \nrelying on them for seed dispersal via their faeces. One such species is the quandong tree. \nThe quandong is a species of parasitic tree that grows on the roots of a host plant  \n(Figure 8). The tree bears large quantities of fruit throughout spring and summer which \nhave very nutritious flesh that contains a large amount of vitamin C and other nutrients. \nGermination of the fruit\u2019s seed is difficult, however, as it is surrounded by a very hard, \ndurable seed coat.

The behaviour of emus also means that quandong seeds are \ndistributed to appropriate habitats \u2013 in the shade, and in proximity to host trees and water. \nThis relationship between the emu and quandong tree is well understood by Indigenous \nAustralians. Aboriginal people looked for quandong trees where emus resided, particularly \nnear water and in shady areas where the birds might rest. Even more importantly, \nAboriginal people noticed that the seeds of the quandong that passed through the emu\u2019s \ndigestive system were softened.

Aboriginal people have played an important role in establishing this industry, \nand it is important that certain groups of Aboriginal people with millennia of knowledge \nabout the quandong be involved in the commercialisation of them. Part of the nature of \nAboriginal culture and knowledge is that plants and animals have cultural importance \nand that it is the responsibility of particular knowledge holders to care for them. It was \nalso Aboriginal knowledge that allowed Western science and culture to discover the \nplants in the first place.

Once your investigation \nis complete, you will then present your research in an appropriate format \u2013 such as a digital \npresentation, oral presentation, or a written report. This \u2018how\u2013to\u2019 guide will help step you through \neach part of the process, and is broken down into key areas to mirror page 26 of the study design: \n1 Understanding the task\n2 Scientific evidence \n3 Scientific communication \n4 Analysing and evaluating a bioethical issue \nWe will even conduct a brief investigation of our own, and use that as an example throughout this \nguide for you to refer to. The research question we have chosen to explore is: \u2018is it ethical to fund \nand undertake human\u2013animal chimera research?\u2019  \nYou may read this guide from start to finish, or simply refer back to certain sections of the guide \nwhenever you are stuck on the corresponding section of your investigation. You may also wish to \nrefresh your knowledge of the key science skills from lesson 1A, or sharpen the tools in your bioethical \ntoolkit from lesson 1B \u2013 good luck!\nUnderstanding the task \nFor Outcome 3 of Unit 2, you are required to identify, analyse, and evaluate a bioethical \nissue related to genetics, reproductive science, or adaptations that are beneficial for \nsurvival. To start this process, you must first choose a biological issue to explore, define \nyour research question, and understand what the aims of your evaluation are. \nStep 1: Choose a biological issue \nRemember back to lesson 1B when we discussed the intersection between science and \nethics. This is an incredibly important point for budding scientists, and is a capability that \nthe VCAA wants to instill in VCE Biology students. As a result, to finalise Unit 2, the VCAA \nrequires students to identify and evaluate a bioethical issue of their own choosing. To do \nthis, you will be asked to identify a current bioethical issue related specifically to one of \nthe following areas of research we\u2019ve examined over the course of this unit: \n1 Genetics (Chapters 7 and 8)\n2 Reproductive science (Chapters 8 and 9)\n3 Adaptations beneficial for survival (Chapter 10).\nTo decide which area of study you wish to investigate, it may be helpful to think about \nwhich topics caught your interest the most. Were there any specific questions you had \nwhen studying one of the areas? Did you find yourself wanting to know more about how a \nparticular bioethical issue impacts on your own life or how the government regulates the \nresearch? As you know, almost all areas of biological research come with a range of social, \neconomic, and political implications. Now it\u2019s just a matter of honing in on one of those \nimplications and formulating a bioethical issue to investigate.Figure 5 in lesson 1B  provides \na preliminary framework for \nidentifying a bioethical issue, \nexploring the surrounding \nconcepts, considering the \ndifferent perspectives,  \nas well as deciding on and \nreflecting upon a chosen \ncourse of action.\nFor further inspiration, you \nmay want to refer to Table 1 \nof lesson 1B , which outlines \nsome current areas of \nresearch that raise bioethical \nquestions. Moreover, there are \nmany resources that provide \ninteresting insights into current \nresearch and the ethics related \nto its applications, including \nthe website: bioethics.com511\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",
  "Page 523": "CHOOSING A BIOLOGICAL ISSUE AND RESEARCH QUESTION\nThe Biology Team at Edrolo has chosen the following research question to explore: \u2018is it ethical to fund \nand undertake human\u2013animal chimera research?\u2019  \nFor reference, a human\u2013animal chimera is any cell or organism that is created via a mixture of human \nand animal material. This is a highly topical area of research in reproductive biology, and has enormous \nconsequences regarding how we treat illnesses and exert control over genetics.\nWe will be exploring this research question throughout the rest of this guide.Try asking broad \u2018application\u2019 style questions like: \u2018how would scientists use this on a \nlarger scale?\u2019, \u2018how can this research be commercialised?\u2019, \u2018would everyone have equal \naccess to this research?, and so forth. You can also go back to lesson 1B which covers \nbioethical issues in detail. Often, bioethical issues are in the news, discussed in TedTalks, \nor debated by politicians and scientists on TV .\nStep 2: Formulate a research question\nThe bioethical issue you choose will typically need to be transformed into a testable \nresearch question, which you will attempt to answer in an informed manner using \nevidence from your research. \nFor example, if you were interested in reproductive science, you might be interested in \nhoning in on cloning and consider the commercial applications of the current state of \nresearch. Remembering that your research question should aim to answer some form of \nbioethical concern, you might ask: \u2018how can we ensure that access to cloning technologies \nis fair and equitable between all Australian agricultural producers\u2019? We can already see \nthe bioethical concept of justice underwriting this question \u2013 it is concerned with access, \nfairness, and the consideration of different stakeholders, namely the different financial \nand contextual situations that make each \u2018producer\u2019 unique. Ultimately, you should \nensure that your research question is testable and binary, so that you can arrive at a \nspecific conclusion. For more information regarding the characteristics of a good research \nquestion, refer to lesson 1A.\nStep 3: Understand what success looks like\nYour final report may take a variety of different forms. The nature of this assessment is \nto provide you with the freedom to decide how best to communicate your research and \nanswer a particular research question that interests you. That being said, there are a few \nbroad things that you will want to be sure to include in your final report: \n\u2022 Thoroughly explain the core biological concepts relevant to your area of study\n\u2022 Discuss different opinions and points of view regarding your bioethical issue \n\u2022 Analyse any legal, social, economic, and ethical implications that surround your \nbioethical issue\n\u2022 Consider how you can use models and graphs to explain ideas and concepts effectively. \nDepending on what presentation style you choose, Figure 1 may be helpful in structuring \nand formatting your presentation.512\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

Remember to consider the examples we have provided and think about how each \nsection might fit into your own report. \nStage 1: Scientific evidence \nStage overview\nTo go from an idea to a well\u2013researched and comprehensive report, presentation, or \nposter, you must first conduct an investigation and collect solid evidence. This evidence \nwill help you answer your research question. \nStage checklist \nFor this section of your investigation you need to demonstrate each of the following:\n\u2022 the distinction between primary and secondary data\n\u2022 the nature of evidence and information: distinction between opinion, anecdote and \nevidence, and scientific and non\u2013scientific ideas\n\u2022 the quality of evidence, including validity and authority of data, and sources of possible \nerrors or bias\n\u2022 methods of organising, analysing, and evaluating secondary data\n\u2022 the use of a logbook to authenticate collated secondary data.\nEach of these points should be addressed in your final report, given that they are taken \ndirectly from page 25 of the VCE Biology Study Design 2022\u20132026.\nStep 1: Establish a logbook \nBefore doing anything, it is important to set up a logbook that can be used while \nresearching and collecting data. This will help you to look back on your research and \nidentify the sources you have used when constructing your report. There is no set format \nfor using a logbook, so it is important to identify what works well for you. You could take \nhandwritten notes, or type up your research with links. Make sure to enter the sources in \nchronological order from when you first used them, as this will enable you to map your \ntrain of thought and allow you to backtrack your research while acknowledging the source \nof the data.\nESTABLISHING A LOGBOOK\nA logbook was helpful in tracking the progress of our research across multiple days.

Make sure to explicitly \nmention the difference in your final report, and show when, where and why you decide to \nuse each type. 514\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",
  "Page 526": "DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY DATA \nIn the case of human\u2013animal chimera research, we might decide to conduct our own surveys, ask a large sample of people about their views, or \ninterview experts. This would generate new responses, and would allow us to collect our own primary data and evidence. \nOn the other hand, secondary data can also be used. For example, in our investigation, we referenced a number of studies, including Kwisda et \nal. (2020), Shaw (2014), and Bourret et al. (2016) \nStep 3: Discuss the nature of evidence\nWhen considering data for your investigation, it is important to be able to draw evidence\u2013\nbased conclusions. In order to do this, you will need to evaluate the strength of different \nstudies and the evidence they provide. Not all studies are the same, and not all studies \ninclude the same level and/or types of evidence. \nTo begin your evaluation, you should identify the nature of the information provided:\n\u2022 Evidence \u2013 refers to primary and/or secondary data given in support of a position.  \nThis will typically be empirical and measurable, and obtained within the context of a \nformal research environment. Not all evidence is equal and certain evidence has more \nweight than other kinds. For example, data collected from a controlled clinical trial \nwith a large and randomised sample is considered stronger than data collected from a \ncase study using a small sample.\n\u2022 Anecdote \u2013 a more informal type of evidence involving a personal account or report  \nof a previous experience that may provide a certain level of support for a position.  \nFor example, a doctor might provide the anecdote: \u2018meditation cures anxiety.  \nI prescribed daily meditation to a patient with severe anxiety, and after a week of \npractice, her symptoms had almost completely disappeared.\u2019 Often the key difference \nbetween anecdotal evidence and more rigorous empirical evidence discussed above \nis the absence of objective documentation, large sample sizes, and/or a controlled \nresearch environment.\n\u2022 Opinion \u2013 refers to the personal belief or viewpoint of an individual, and is typically yet \nto be verified or deemed as fact. An opinion may be based on evidence and/or anecdote, \nbut typically rests on grounds that are insufficient to arrive at complete certainty. \nCOMPARING OUR EVIDENCE \n\u2022 There is a large body of research and evidence associated with the bioethical issue of human\u2013animal \nchimeras. Deciding which research to use was difficult. Certain categories of research that we  \nused were:\n\u2022 Evidence \u2013 Kwisda et. al. (2020) conducted a literature review of several scientific databases and \nretrieved 431 articles published between 2003\u20132017 in peer\u2013reviewed journals. \n\u2022 Anecdote \u2013 in another article, a particular geneticist discussed a bioethics conference that he \nattended and mentioned the comments of other experts in the field.\n\u2022 Opinion \u2013 over the course of our research, we also found blog posts where many individuals \nexpressed their opinions about human\u2013animal chimera research. We decided to avoid using opinion \nin our final report, given that opinions are rarely verified and are typically the weakest form of \nevidence available. That said, we did use opinions as a starting point to help guide our research. For \nexample, one blog post, written by a Biology professor, argued that animals with human DNA did \nnot attain human status and therefore have less legal rights. This prompted further research into the \nscientific and legal literature to either verify or discredit the claim.\u2022 Primary data refers to results collected from experiments, interviews, or surveys \nundertaken by the researchers themselves. \n\u2022 Secondary data refers to results from sources other than the researcher\u2019s own \ninvestigations, which may be discussed or leveraged by the researchers in the course of \ntheir own research. 515\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",
  "Page 527": "Step 4: Discuss the quality of evidence \nValidity and authority of data \nThere are many ways in which we can judge the quality of data and evidence. Once again, \nthese are discussed in great detail in lesson 1A, and include measures such as: \n\u2022 repeatability \u2013 can the investigation be repeated by the same person using the same \nmethod and still obtain the same results?\n\u2022 reproducibility \u2013 can other scientists follow the same method and get the same results?\n\u2022 validity \u2013 does the research actually measure what it claims to measure? In other \nwords, is our data answering our research question?\nWhen deciding on relevant data to use for your investigation, make sure you consider the \nquality of the data in light of these measures. Further, look to see whether the data has \nbeen peer\u2013reviewed and whether it is supported by other researchers. Just because the \nevidence that you use to justify and argue your position is not an anecdote or opinion, it \ndoes not automatically mean that it is therefore strong evidence. If the experiment from \nwhich the evidence is derived is not repeatable, reproducible, or valid, then the evidence \nis unlikely to be reliable. Make sure to familiarise yourself with this terminology and use it \nthroughout your final investigation. \nSources of possible errors or bias\nThere are also a number of sources of possible error and/or bias that may exist in your \nchosen investigation. It is important to look for any potential errors or bias in the data \nyou use for your investigation, and then mention these in your report. Often these will be \nexplicitly mentioned by the researcher. \nSome common errors to look for include (but are not limited to):\n\u2022 Personal errors \u2013 which arise due to mistakes or miscalculations made by the \nresearcher themselves. Counting incorrectly, rounding to the wrong decimal place, or \nlabelling samples incorrectly are all examples of personal error.\n\u2022 Systematic errors \u2013 which cause results to differ from the true value by a consistent \namount each time, typically due to faulty equipment or calibration. They affect the \naccuracy of the experiment, and cannot be minimised through replication.\n\u2022 Random errors \u2013 which affect the precision of the findings and are caused by \nunpredictable variations in the measurement process. For example, when a quantity is \nestimated by reading between the lines on a measuring cylinder.\nSome common types of bias to look for include (but are not limited to): \n\u2022 Confirmation bias \u2013 which refers to the tendency of researchers to only search for and/\nor include information that supports their personal beliefs, hypothesis, or the aim of \ntheir research.\n\u2022 Selection bias \u2013 which refers to situations in which the selection of research \nparticipants is not properly randomised, meaning that the sample used to test the \nresearch question is not appropriately representative of the wider population that the \nresearch is hoping to draw conclusions about. \n\u2022 Publication bias \u2013 which refers to situations in which the actual outcome or findings of \na study determines whether it is published or not, and not only the merit or quality of \nthe research. Journals will often publish studies with significant results (or \u2018positive\u2019 \nfindings) more often and earlier than those with negative results or nonsignificant \nconclusions. Why is this a problem? All findings are important, whether they find \nsomething new or not. On a large scale, if publication bias exists then the published \nliterature on a topic will not be properly representative of the actual available evidence, \nwhich means that the conclusions we draw from the existing scientific evidence may \nnot accurately reflect the true phenomenon we are examining.516\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",
  "Page 528": "Step 5: Consider methods for analysing, organising, and evaluating \nThis investigation requires you to interact with lots of research and data. To do this, \nyou must first analyse what you are reading to identify whether it is applicable to your \nresearch. Then, you should evaluate its strength or reliability before organising it in a way \nthat makes sense to your reader. Let us look at these points in isolation.\nAnalysis \nTo analyse data you must compare the purpose of your investigation with the type of data \nyou obtained \u2013 what is your research question and what type of data is needed to arrive at \na meaningful conclusion? A clear understanding of what you are collecting data for will \nhelp you remain focused when analysing different sources and their relevance to your \nresearch question. To do this, you must consider the pros and cons of each different study \nthrough the lens of different measures, such as sample size, reproducibility, and the study\u2019s \nvalidity (Step 4). \nOrganisation \nOrganising data requires you to determine how best to display the key takeaways. This \nwill typically involve transforming the data (e.g. into a table, line graph, or bar graph) to \nhighlight any trend, pattern, or relationship that exists. For more information on how best \nto present data, see Table 7 in lesson 1A. \nEvaluation \nOnce you have analysed and organised the data, it is now time to evaluate the strength of \nyour findings and determine whether your research question is supported or not. This \nis known as coming to a position or course of action. You will judge the strength of the \nresearch based on the measures you considered in Step 4, and reach a judgement as to \nwhat the findings can tell you about your chosen area of research. This is likely where you \nwill comment on any potential sources of error or bias (Step 4) and determine whether the \nresearcher has acknowledged it themselves or not. JUDGING OUR EVIDENCE \u2013 LOOKING FOR ERRORS AND BIASES \nThe studies that we used for our investigation were taken from peer\u2013reviewed academic journals. Further, we made sure to consider each study \nin light of potential errors or bias. For example: \n\u2022 Kwisda et. al. (2020) included several databases for their screening to avoid selection bias towards a particular journal.\n\u2022 Many of the literature reviews we looked at made use of searching software to avoid personal errors on the part of the researcher. \n\u2022 Some of the research articles we examined as evidence were funded entirely by private research companies with strong stakes in the \ncommercial application of human\u2013animal chimera research. While this research is still helpful for our report, we were careful to consider \nthe potential confirmation bias that the company might have in representing chimera research favourably. \nYou will notice that we mention potential errors and biases in our investigation, as well as where and how they are being controlled. Take the \nfirst two dot points for example. Here we are explaining that the researchers made sure to \u2018avoid\u2019 or \u2018control for\u2019 selection bias, which is just as \nimportant as identifying the actual presence of bias in the first place. This is because it shows that considerations were taken to make the evidence \nas reliable as possible. Look for opportunities to mention this in your report \u2013 it\u2019s a great way to demonstrate your skills as a researcher!\nANALYSING, ORGANISING, AND EVALUATING \nWhile researching, we came across many different types of information to help inform us as to whether human\u2013animal chimera research \nis ethically justifiable. During our research stage, we collated any relevant and interesting data, and used our logbook to take notes on the \nstrength and limitations of each resource based on the measures identified in Step 2. \ncont\u2019d517\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

Now it\u2019s time \nto begin the process of presenting your findings \u2013 an exercise that requires a working \nknowledge of scientific communication. As you will soon see, this involves identifying \nan audience, communicating concepts effectively, and presenting data as clearly and \ncreatively as possible. \nStage checklist\nFor this section of your investigation you need to consider each of the following:\n\u2022 biological concepts specific to the investigation: definitions of key terms, use of \nappropriate biological terminology, conventions, and representations\n\u2022 characteristics of effective science communication: accuracy of biological information, \nclarity of explanation of biological concepts, ideas and models, contextual clarity with \nreference to importance and implications of findings, conciseness and coherence, and \nappropriateness for purpose and audience \n\u2022 the use of data representations, models and theories in organising and explaining \nobserved phenomena and biological concepts, and their limitations\n\u2022 the influence of social, economic, legal, and political factors relevant to the selected \nresearch question\n\u2022 conventions for referencing and acknowledging sources of information.\nOnce again, each of these points should be clearly demonstrated in your final report, and \nare taken directly from page 25 of the VCE Biology Study Design 2022\u20132026.\nStep 1: Defining key biological concepts \nA major part of a successful investigation is defining the scope of your area of study, and \ncommunicating any key biological concepts that are needed to understand your research. \nThis involves defining any key terms that might be relevant to your area of investigation, \nand informing your reader of any difficult biological concepts that underpin your chosen \narea of study. ANALYSING, ORGANISING, AND EVALUATING  \u2013 CONTINUED\nAnalysis:\n\u2022 From there, it was time to analyse all of the data that we collected during our research stage. This involved considering all relevant \nperspectives surrounding the issue, and weighing up their strengths and weaknesses. \n\u2022 We also identified studies that were not relevant to our research question, such as those that were outdated or beyond the scope.  \nGiven that our research question was focused on the ethics of \u2018funding\u2019 and \u2018undertaking\u2019 human\u2013animal chimera research, this meant  \nwe excluded resources and evidence unrelated to these themes.\n\u2022 Analysis of the data also allowed us to look for possible conclusions. For example, when we collated the information from our different \nsources, we realised that many of the arguments could be classified as either ethical pros or cons. From here we were able to flesh out both \nsides of the argument and establish whether the existing literature is predominantly for or against human\u2013animal chimera research. \nOrganisation:  \n\u2022 Another decision that we made as researchers was to transform the secondary data from the literature reviews into a table that more \nclearly highlights the focus of our research question \u2013 namely, any ethical justifications for human\u2013animal chimera research. The table was \ndesigned as follows: \nT able #\u2002 Ethical justifications \nEthical justification #1 Description Source\nEthical justification #2 Description Source\nEthical justification #3 Description Source\nEvaluation:  \n\u2022 Once we chose our data, looked for patterns, and organised the information in the most effective way possible, we finally evaluated the \ninformation in our report and came to a conclusion. This was the largest part of our discussion and included details about the strengths and \nweaknesses of our research as well as an overall statement about what our investigation had revealed.518\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

For \nexample, we began with a paragraph that explained the background information about our chosen area of research, including what a human\u2013\nanimal chimera is, as well as the current legal regulations around their research and applications. For instance, we define a  \nhuman\u2013animal chimera as any cell or organism that is created via a mixture of human and animal material. We also made sure to distinguish \nthe different categories of chimera research, such as in vitro and in vivo research. \nSPEAKING TO OUR AUDIENCE\nWe decided to communicate our research findings to VCE Biology students. As such, we made sure to transform complex research and \nempirical data, which was originally written for an academic audience, into a more digestible format. This involved summarising long sections \nof intricate methods, and considering improved representations such as tables and graphs (Step 3). Step 2: Understanding the characteristics of effective communication\nOften the most difficult part of a scientific investigation is understanding how to \ncommunicate your findings in the most effective way possible. This is usually determined \nby identifying who your audience is and, in turn, employing the most appropriate tone \nand formality for your writing style. Check who the hypothetical target audience for your \ninvestigation is with your teacher, and then consider the following questions regarding \nyour audience: \n\u2022 Have I presented difficult concepts in a way that is accessible for my chosen audience? \n\u2022 Is the length of my investigation appropriate?

Depending on the \ninstructions given by your teacher, this might involve a presentation, an essay, a poster, \na video, or a wide range of other presentation styles. This might also involve the use of \ntables and/or graphs, and will require you to consider both the benefits and limitations \nof choosing one representation style over another. For more information on models and \nvisuals, refer to lesson 1A. \nHOW SHOULD WE STRUCTURE THIS THING?\nIn our report we broke information into subheadings, and supported complex ideas with diagrams and flowcharts. We also tried to make the \ninvestigation engaging by including figures and images.

This might require you to \nconsider the presence of any possible discrimination, prejudice, or disadvantage based \non race, gender, ethnicity, social class, and/or sexual orientation.\n\u2022 Economic factors will typically involve money, and the use of goods and services. You \nmay need to consider how your research might be applied at a larger scale, and any \neconomic challenges this could entail \u2013 like time investment and cost.\n\u2022 Political factors will typically involve government policy or messaging. You may need \nto consider any recent political discussion surrounding your research topic, as well as \ncurrent government policies surrounding its application. Some of these may be found \non news websites and TV outlets.\n\u2022 Legal factors will typically involve current legalities and regulatory bodies that dictate \nthe research and applications of your chosen topic. This could include current laws and \nacts, which you may need to research and mention in your report.\nPROVIDING CONTEXT \u2013 ARE THERE EXTERNAL FACTORS WORTH MENTIONING? \nThere were many outside influences relevant to our area of study. The level of depth you provide on these influences is dependent on how \nspecific your research question is, as well as the word count and instruction of your teacher. Some of the outside influences we considered in \nthe area of human\u2013animal chimera research included: \n\u2022 Social \u2013 there are groups in society who believe that human\u2013animal chimera research threatens the inherent dignity of human beings. For \nexample, many religions oppose the combination of animal and human DNA on the grounds that it violates the will of God.  \n\u2022 Economic \u2013 many researchers have expressed that the financial cost of creating a chimera organ large enough for sufficient research is far \ntoo high, and that our current healthcare system does not sufficiently reimburse researchers. \n\u2022 Legal \u2013 under current Australian laws, the creation of human\u2013animal chimeras is regulated under the Prohibition of Human Cloning for \nReproduction (PHCR) Act 2002, which prohibits the development of hybrid embryos longer than 14 days. However, in other countries like \nChina and the USA, these laws are often not as restrictive and encourage freer research practices.HOW SHOULD WE STRUCTURE THIS THING? \u2013 CONTINUED\nSome subheadings we chose to use included: \n\u2022 Introduction\n\u2022 Research\n \u2013 Biological concepts \n \u2013 Social implications \n \u2013 Economic implications \n \u2013 Legal implications\n\u2022 Discussion \n\u2022 Conclusion\nStep 5: Referencing correctly\nWhen using other people\u2019s work to support your research, you must provide a reference \nwhich outlines the source of the information and where the original piece of work can be \nfound. There are many different forms of referencing, and the style that you choose will \noften depend on personal preference, the area of research, and/or the school or university \nguidelines.

Firstly, it requires you to engage with an area of \nUnit 2 in a deeper way, going beyond what was taught in class to read and learn about the \napplications of that knowledge. Secondly, it requires you to engage critically with these \napplications and consider broader bioethical concerns that might arise, whether they be \nsocial, economic, political and so on. As you know, to engage with bioethical issues, one \nmust employ their highly specialised bioethical toolkit. Let\u2019s refresh ourselves now! \nStage checklist\nFor this section of your investigation you need to consider each of the following:\n\u2022 ways of identifying bioethical issues\n\u2022 characteristics of effective analysis of bioethical issues\n\u2022 approaches to bioethics and ethical concepts as they apply to the bioethical issue  \nbeing investigated.\nStep 1: Sharpen your bioethical toolkit to analyse bioethical issues \nThrough gathering your evidence and presenting your findings, hopefully you have been \nable to evaluate your chosen bioethical concern and come to a conclusion on your research \nquestion. To do this, however, you would have needed your bioethical toolkit, which we \ntook a close look at in lesson 1B. An effective analysis of bioethical issues will typically \ninvolve actively considering varied different perspectives. This can be achieved by using \nmultiple bioethical concepts to explore the issue through different lenses. \nTo analyse a bioethical issue, you may decide to use a number of different approaches to \nbioethics and bioethical concepts. Each of these bioethical \u2018tools\u2019 may be used in isolation, \nbut are more commonly used in conjunction with one another to help the individual \nconsider all aspects of a bioethical concern.

As they are unable to photosynthesise, yeast must acquire the food molecules they \nneed for respiration from their environment. Yeast do not require oxygen to respire; instead, \nthey can undertake anaerobic cellular respiration in the following reaction:\nglucose ethanol + carbon dioxide + energy\nFigure 1\u2002 Equation for anaerobic respiration in yeast\nAnaerobic respiration is also referred to as fermentation. The energy produced is in the form \nof adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The reaction shown depicts anaerobic cellular respiration \nin plants and yeast, but in humans it is different. When we undertake anaerobic cellular \nrespiration we produce lactic acid rather than ethanol and carbon dioxide. Consider this a \ngood thing \u2013 if we produced ethanol whenever we anaerobically respired, we would get drunk \nwhenever we exercised which would be a nightmare during school cross country!\nMany different kinds of yeast exist in nature. In the wild, they are typically found growing \non the fruits or grains of plants, from where they obtain a variety of food molecules. Several \nstrains of yeast have been domesticated for human use, mainly for baking and brewing \npurposes.\nThe domesticated yeast we use in baking is typically fed refined sugar as a fuel source. As the \ndough rests, the yeast consumes the sugar and releases carbon dioxide bubbles, which causes \nthe dough to rise. \nIn this activity, you will measure the rate of respiration in yeast that are provided with different \nfood sources, or exposed to different temperatures and conditions.

These can include water, \noxygen, wastes, and food. The movement of these substances is required for survival, and it is \ntherefore important for a cell to transport them efficiently. Transport speed is dependent on \nthe surface area to volume ratio (SA:V), which is dependent on both a cell\u2019s size and its shape.\nThis practical models what you have learned about surface area to volume ratio by using pink \nagar jelly cubes that vary in size to determine the effect that surface area to volume ratio has \non diffusion rate. The agar cubes contain a phenolphthalein indicator, which visually indicates \nthe acidity of an environment by changing colour. In low-acid, or alkaline environments, \nphenolphthalein turns pink, whilst in higher acidic environments it turns clear. Additionally, \nthe agar cubes contain sodium hydroxide, an alkaline solution that allows the indicator, and \nthereby the cubes, to turn pink. Therefore, when we add an acid, sulphuric acid, we can expect \nthat the cubes will gradually turn clear as acid diffuses inside and increases the acidity.\nAIM\nTo observe and record the effect of surface area to volume ratio on the rate of diffusion.Resource s\nRisk assessments, lab tech \nnotes, and answers are \navailable online.\nMETHOD\n1 Use the scalpel/knife to cut the agar jelly into four cubes with sides of 10 mm, 30 mm, 50 mm, and 70 mm in length. \nTake care to ensure accuracy in your cuts.\n10 mm 30 mm 50 mm 70 mm\nFigure 1\u2002 The four cut agar cubes\n2 Pour 125 mL of sulphuric acid into the four beakers, or until half full.MATERIALS\n\u2022 pre-prepared agar jelly containing phenolphthalein indicator and sodium hydroxide\n\u2022 0.1 M sulphuric acid\n\u2022 4 \u00d7 250 mL beakers\n\u2022 tongs\n\u2022 1 \u00d7 scalpel or knife\n\u2022 1 \u00d7 stirring rod\n\u2022 paper towel\n\u2022 1 \u00d7 ruler\n\u2022 1 \u00d7 timer\n\u2022 lab coat\n\u2022 safety glasses\n\u2022 gloves\n2.3 INVESTIGATION 529\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

Molecules can move across the membrane in a variety of \nways, both actively and passively. The size and polarity of molecules, as well as their \nconcentration either side of the membrane, determine if active or passive transport is used. \nWater, for example, moves from areas of low solute concentration to high solute \nconcentration passively via osmosis. When a cell has more solutes than its environment, the \ncell is considered hypertonic and the environment is hypotonic. In this scenario, water will \nmove into the cell. If the cell and the environment have the same concentration of solutes, \nthen the solutions are isotonic and  there will be no net movement of water.\nThe yolk of an unfertilised chicken egg is a single, very large cell. There is a small \nspot you can sometimes see, called the germinal disk, which is where the nuclear \nmaterial is located. If the egg is fertilised, this is where the chick would grow. \nThe rest of the yolk (the cell body) contains nutrients to feed the growing chick, \nand the plasma membrane is just inside the vitelline membrane. One layer out, \nwe can see the egg white. The egg white is not made of cells, but rather albumin \n(a protein product of cells) and water, and it supports the yolk. The egg white \nalso contains the chalaza, a proteinous fibre that connects the yolk to the inner \nmembrane below the shell, as well as an outer membrane, which connects to the \nshell. Both of these membranes are mostly made of keratin, so do not resemble \nthe plasma membrane. \nThis scientific investigation is a controlled experiment that asks you to apply your \nunderstanding of the structure of the plasma membrane and the movement of substances \nacross it based on their size and polarity. The experiment involves putting a shell-less egg in \neither distilled water, 5% NaCl solution, or 10% NaCl solution, and measuring changes in egg \nsize and mass over time.\nAIM\nTo investigate how varying levels of solute concentration affect the movement of water across \na chicken egg membrane.Resource s\nRisk assessments, lab tech \nnotes, and answers are \navailable online.\nshell membrane\nalbumin\nchalaza\nvitelline membrane\nyolk\ngerminal disk\neggshell\nchalaza\nair cell\nImage: ShadeDesign/Shutterstock.com\nFigure 1\u2002 The composition of an egg\nMATERIALS\n\u2022 3 \u00d7 chicken eggs\n\u2022 5% NaCl solution\n\u2022 10% NaCl solution\n\u2022 distilled water\n\u2022 1 \u00d7 spoon\n\u2022 1 \u00d7 electronic balance\n\u2022 3 \u00d7 beakers\n\u2022 3 \u00d7 jars\n\u2022 vinegar\n\u2022 paper towelSCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS 532\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

But, in the \nscheme of things, most of the water that plants absorb from the soil is lost to the atmosphere \nvia tiny pores in the leaves called stomata. This process is called transpiration, and it is vital \nfor transportation of nutrients, cooling the plant, and prevention of cell damage and wilting. \nTranspiration works due to capillary action, cohesion of water molecules, and differences in \npressure between different regions of the plant and the environment. \nWhile transpiration is important, too much transpiration can lead to excessive water loss from \nthe plant, and even plant death. Certain environmental factors such as high temperatures, \nwind, and low humidity can increase the rate of transpiration. Some plants have evolved \nmechanisms to help regulate transpiration and prevent water loss in these conditions. \nIn this investigation, you will measure the rate of transpiration in celery that is in humid \nor standard environments. By doing so, you will discover if celery can regulate its rate of \ntranspiration, and identify how quickly celery transpires water. You will also be able to \nvisualise the process of transpiration and observe the structures through which water moves. \nIn Part B of the investigation, you have the opportunity to improve on the original method \noutlined in Part A, and test if other factors influence the rate of transpiration in celery.\nAIM\nTo observe and record the movement of water through a celery stalk in a humid, closed \nenvironment compared to a stalk that is exposed to a less humid, open environment. \nMATERIALS\nPart A\n\u2022 4 \u00d7 celery stalks with leaves attached\n\u2022 2 \u00d7 beakers (or glasses or cups)\n\u2022 red or blue food colouring\n\u2022 single-edge razor blades or scalpels\n\u2022 cling wrap\n\u2022 clear, sealable plastic container that is large enough to fit an upright celery stalk\n\u2022 1 \u00d7 ruler\nPart B\n\u2022 student-directed.

Carefully use a scalpel to make a clean cut to remove the base of each stalk. After removing the \nbase, the four stalks should be of a similar height.\n3 Set two stalks into each beaker.

Our bodies, however, are constantly \nexperiencing different environments and conditions. In order to keep our internal environment \nas stable as possible, our bodies undergo a variety of processes to maintain homeostasis. \nOne factor that influences the environment of our cells is the amount of exercise we do. When \nexercising, our muscle cells undergo increased amounts of cellular respiration. As a result of \nthis, they use more oxygen than they normally do, and produce more carbon dioxide than they \ndo when resting. In order to maintain homeostasis during exercise and ensure normal cellular \nfunction, our bodies have to correct these changes as quickly as possible. \nTwo internal systems that are incredibly important to the maintenance of homeostasis during \nand after exercise are the circulatory and respiratory systems. The circulatory system delivers \noxygen and nutrients to cells in the body and removes the waste products they create. The \nrespiratory system, on the other hand, is responsible for oxygenating blood and removing carbon \ndioxide from the body. As exercise results in increased oxygen consumption by cells, both the \nrespiratory and circulatory systems must work to compensate for these increased demands and \nfor the increased production of waste products. Is there a way we can measure this process? \nAnd how quickly are our circulatory and respiratory systems able to compensate for exercise? \nAIM\nTo observe and record the effect of exercise on heart rate and respiratory rate.\nMETHOD\nPart A: resting rates\n1 Form groups of three or four.

Take a look at Figure 1, for \ninstance. How many of these birds do you recognise? Can you think of some reasons why \nthese birds might have evolved such different beaks? \nSome of the main contributors to the shape and size of a particular bird species\u2019 beak include \ntheir main food sources (do they need to reach deep into the ground, for example), and the \nway they attract mates (some species prioritise longer beaks when selecting a mate). \nHowever, what if I were to tell you that the beaks of some birds often serve a homeostatic \npurpose? The basis of this idea comes from what is known as \u2018Allen\u2019s rule\u2019 (Joel Allen, 1877 ), \nwhich suggests that animals in colder climates will have shorter appendages (beaks \nincluded) than similar animals in warmer climates.\nThe reason for this is simple, and relates to the SA:V ratio of the animal\u2019s body. Assuming \nyou are a bird in a cold climate, it makes sense to have as small a beak as possible, as this \nreduces the amount of heat that is lost through that part of the body (due to the reduced \nexposed surface area). When the temperature is cold, the bird will limit the amount of blood \nthat is sent to its beak which minimises heat loss. The opposite is also true for birds in warmer \nclimates. For example, the toucan, which has one of the largest beaks per body size of any \nbird, can attribute around 60 percent of its heat loss to its beak. In this investigation, you \nwill review the work of Greenberg et al. (2012), who used infrared imaging to demonstrate \nthe heat loss differences between Atlantic Song Sparrows ( Melospiza melodia atlantica ) and \nEastern Song Sparrows ( Melospiza melodia melodia ).\nAIM\nTo visualise the effect of Allen\u2019s rule in two separate species of song sparrow.

Since DNA is so critical, it is found in nearly every cell. Each cell contains \na copy of the entire set of genetic instructions, which is referred to as the genome. Scientists \nstudy an organism\u2019s genome for many reasons, including solving forensic investigations, \ndeveloping novel therapies, genetically modifying crops, or establishing the evolutionary \nhistory of different species. \nIn order to obtain and visualise DNA, scientists have established a method to extract, isolate, \nand observe DNA from thousands of cells at a time.

In eukaryotes, a copy of the organism\u2019s genome \nis contained within each of their cells, provided that cell has a nucleus to house the DNA. \nThe size of an organism\u2019s genome depends on its species. The human genome, for instance, is \nmore than three billion base pairs in length, while the fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) has a \nmuch smaller genome of approximately 165 million base pairs in length. However, size isn\u2019t the \nonly way in which we can compare and contrast the genomics of different species. For instance, \nwe can also look at the level of similarity between different gene sequences. Overall, the more \ndifferences that exist between the genomes of different organisms, the less related the two \norganisms are likely to be. \nModelling is an important type of scientific methodology that is often used in comparative \ngenomics to observe these genomic differences.

Variants of these genes are \nknown as alleles. Each individual possesses two alleles for each gene. These alleles can \nbe represented by a genotype, which encodes for our phenotype. When studying genetics \nand inheritance, monohybrid and dihybrid crosses are effective ways to track the possible \nphenotypes inherited from two parents to their offspring for one or two traits respectively.\nIn this investigation, you are going to flip coins to build a bird then breed it with one of your \nclassmate\u2019s birds and predict the potential genotypes of your offspring. \nAIM\nTo simulate inheritance patterns of genes across generations.Resource s\nRisk assessments, lab tech \nnotes, and answers are \navailable online.\nMATERIALS\n\u2022 white paper or a printed copy of the results section (included)\n\u2022 coloured pencils\n\u2022 2 \u00d7 coins\n\u2022 1 \u00d7 dice\nMETHOD\nEye colour Wing colour\nBody colourEAEAEAEBEBEB\nWW/Ww ww\nFAFAFAFBFBFBZLZlBeak length\nFigure 1\u2002 Possible phenotypes of the bird and their respective genotypes\nPart A: Determine the characteristics of your bird\n1 To determine the genotype of your bird\u2019s eye colour, flip the two coins at once.

This means that if you flip one head and one tail, your bird would be \nheterozygous in incomplete dominance and have the genotype EAEB, which codes for blue eyes. \n2 Write your bird\u2019s genotype for eye colour in Table 1, then use Figure 1 to determine the phenotype.\n3 Repeat steps 1 and 2 for wing colour and body colour.

Diploid organisms inherit a combination of two alleles \nof a gene from their parents \u2013 in homozygous individuals, these alleles are the same; in \nheterozygous individuals, these alleles are different. In a heterozygous individual, one allele \nmight be expressed over the other \u2013 this allele is said to be dominant, whilst the other is said \nto be recessive. This pattern of inheritance and dominance explains much of how we look and \nbehave \u2013 and even potentially how we taste!  \nOur tongues are covered in small bumps called papillae. On the surface of these are taste \nbuds that contain gustatory cells. The tips of gustatory cells are coated in taste receptors and \nproject onto the surface of the tongue (Figure 1). Molecules in food interact with these \nreceptors, generating nerve signals that travel to our brains and allow us to perceive one of the \nfive taste modalities \u2013 sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami. The shape of these receptors, \nhowever, and therefore their ability to interact with different molecules, differs between \nindividuals according to their genetic makeup. This can be seen most clearly in the different \nflavours people experience when tasting a compound called phenylthiourea-\nphenylthiocarbamide, or PTC for short.   \nPTC is a non-toxic compound that chemically resembles alkaloid compounds \nfound in some toxic plants. For some people, PTC tastes incredibly bitter. \nFor others, however, they can place PTC directly on their tongues and taste \nnothing. It is thought that a single gene, TAS2R38 , that codes for the TAS2R38 \nbitter taste receptor, is responsible for a person\u2019s ability to taste PTC and \nthat this gene has two common alleles and at least five rarer alleles. Whilst \nPTC isn\u2019t found in nature, it is thought that the ability to taste it means that \na person is far more sensitive to flavours in food than a person who can\u2019t \ntaste it. These people are sometimes referred to as \u2018supertasters\u2019! Are you a \nsupertaster?

At an ecosystem level, biodiversity is measured by the number of \ndifferent species inhabiting the area, and this can provide us with insight into the health of \nan ecosystem. Greater plant diversity typically supports a greater diversity of animal life as \nyou move up the trophic levels, and in Chapter 10 you learned about the many reasons why \nbiodiversity is integral for us and for the planet. \nTo understand and uncover the level of biodiversity within a particular habitat, scientists \ncan survey and sample the area to quantify biodiversity. The information collected from a \nbiodiversity survey provides people with the ability to assess conservation values, understand \nchanges in land use, document heritage, and aid resource management. Some survey \ntechniques are very complex and require vast expertise to undertake, but basic techniques \nare extremely simple and can be conducted by any aspiring scientist. For example, searching \nfor and counting each individual organism within an ecosystem (the total count method) to \ndiscover the biodiversity is far too time-consuming. Instead, surveying a smaller part of the \necosystem can provide insights into the ecosystem as a whole and form the basis for decision \nmaking surrounding conservation.  \nIn this activity, the focus of the survey is to examine the effects humans have on the \nbiodiversity of habitats. You will propose a hypothesis about the impact humans have on \nbiodiversity, and you will use sampling techniques to complete a series of investigations. The \nresults you collect will either support or contradict your hypothesis. So, what do you think? \nHow are the levels of biodiversity of an ecosystem, and the amount of human impact on that \necosystem, related?\nAIM\nTo survey the biodiversity of multiple locations with varying degrees of human impact. \nHYPOTHESIS\nState your hypothesis in the following box.

  "Page 575": "METHOD\nPreparation \u2013 24 hours prior to class\n1 In this activity, you will survey pre-approved locations to find out about the variety of plants and animals that live \nwithin them. Prior to class, your teacher will choose suitable locations for the surveys. Three sites are needed for  \nthe practical. \n \u2212The first site should show little or low human impact (e.g. a forested area, natural grasslands or any other area \nthat appears mostly untouched by humans). \n \u2212A second site should show moderate human impact (e.g. a grassland adjacent to buildings or a park). \n \u2212The third location should show high human impact (e.g. a football oval or even a parking lot).\n2 The three locations can be selected within or outside of school grounds, depending on the applicability. Importantly, \nthe three sites should possess significantly different levels of human impact and need to be wide and open areas. \nIdeally, all three sites chosen will be similar in size. The sites should be accessible to all students and not be of great \ndistance from one another. If locations are selected outside of school grounds, permission needs to be granted if \nnecessary to pass through areas outside of school. The safety of each location is integral and a risk assessment \nshould be performed which addresses any hazards.\n3 It can also be useful to learn the surveying techniques within the class before implementing it on site. \nConducting the survey\n4 Form groups of three. Assign roles within the group for the fieldwork. One student will be a recorder, and two \nstudents will be surveyors. \n5 At the first location, a starting point is selected within the area. A 10 m line is then measured from the starting \npoint to an endpoint. Half a meter is measured on either side of the 10 m line. You now have a 10 m long, 1 m wide \nstrip that is 10 m2 in area (Figure 1). This is your survey area and this surveying technique is known as strip transect \nsampling. Make sure that your strip does not interfere with the areas of your classmates. \n START\nPOINTEND\nPOINTStudent movement\n10 m\n1 m 1 m\n10 m\nFigure 1\u2002 The strip transect survey area\n6 Within your survey strip, begin searching for evidence of animal life. Side by side, the two surveyors will slowly walk \nalong the survey area and call out every single sign, or trace of animal life they spot. The survey should be thorough; \nmake sure you take your time to conduct it very slowly. A sign of animal life may include:\n \u2212animals themselves that are present \n \u2212footprints and trails \n \u2212burrows and hollows\n \u2212nests or eggs\n \u2212faeces \n \u2212feathers, fur, dead skin, and other remains\n \u2212rubbish (a sign of humans)\n7 Be sure to lift up all leaves, branches and rocks to look for insects and other small animals. Keep an eye out directly \nabove your area for any birds flying over the area. If trees are present or overhang your area be sure to check them for \nsigns of animals. We want all the different types of species to be recorded. It will be difficult to distinguish whether \nsome signs are from different species or not, but do your best as a team to decide.\n8 As the survey occurs the recorder notes the data. You do not need to identify what each species is, you just need to \nmake a list of all the different species you think are present. \n9 When the surveyors have made it to the end of the line, it is time to decide as a group whether the abundance \n(amount) of each species was relatively low (L), medium (M), or high (H) in the strip compared to the other species. \nAn example of how your results could look can be seen in Table 1.

As you work your way through the VCE Legal Studies course, you will be learning about many different \nlaws and legal cases. To be able to recognise laws and legal cases, and to reference them in your notes and assessment tasks, you should master the basics of  legal citation.  \n   W h a t  is legal citation?  \n   Legal citation  is the system used to refer to legal documents and \nsources such as cases and Acts of  parliament in a consistent and accurate way. The most commonly cited legal documents/uni00A0are:  \n   \u2022       Acts of parliament  (also known as  statutes  and \n legislation )   \n  \u2022      legal cases (also known as court decisions).    \n      \n  The following information will help you in reading \nand understanding legal citations. It will also help you \ncite legal documents correctly in your coursework and assessment/uni00A0tasks.     \n    C i t i n g  Acts of/uni00A0parliament  \n   Acts of parliament  (often called just \u2018 Acts\u2019) are laws made \nby the various parliaments in Australia (i.e. state and territory parliaments and the Commonwealth Parliament) and in other countries around the/uni00A0world.  \n  Acts of  parliament generally feature the following pieces of  \ninformation in this/uni00A0order:  \n   \u2022       The name of the Act or statute  \u2013 This is the title that has been \ngiven to the statute.

  "Page 11": "ix USING  ACCESS & JUSTICE\n437 CHAPTER 13 REMEDIES436  UNIT 2 SANCTIONS, REMEDIES AND RIGHTSTHE ROLE OF THE JURY IN A/uni00A0CIVIL/uni00A0TRIAL 13.8 Composition of/uni00A0a civil/uni00A0trial\nThere are six jurors in a civil jury in the County Court and the Supreme Court. Each juror is randomly \nselected from the Victorian electoral roll. Up to two extra jurors can be selected if  the trial is expected to \nbe lengthy, though two jurors will be discharged once it comes to deliberating. This means only six jurors will be involved in deciding the verdict.As discussed in  Chapter/uni00A011, the jury system is a trial by peers. The jury must listen to all the evidence and \nmake a decision based on the facts. In a civil case the jury considers the evidence having regard to the law that is explained to them by the judge, and decides who is in the/uni00A0wrong.\nWhen is a jury used in civil trials?\nUnlike some criminal cases, there is no automatic right to a jury in a civil/uni00A0trial. For example:\n\u2022 in the Magistrates\u2019 Court, and in appeal cases, there is no/uni00A0jury\u2022 in the County Court and the Supreme Court, a jury is optional. If  either party wants a jury, then they \nmust request a jury trial. They must also pay the fees associated with it (though a judge is able to still \norder that the trial be by judge alone). \nIt is also possible for the judge to require a jury for a civil trial. If  this is the case, the state will pay for \nthe jury. It is not common for a judge to request a jury trial.\nCivil jury trials are rare, largely because of  the fees involved, and often because civil trials are so \ncomplex that parties will elect to have a trial by judge alone. Juries, however, are sometimes used in \ndefamation/uni00A0cases. In the legal case below, a jury was requested by the plaintiffs.\nJury trial despite complex issues in the/uni00A0case\nHumphris v Connecteast Nominee Company Pty Ltd (No 2)/uni00A0[2016] VSC 419 \n(27 July/uni00A02016)\nIn this case, the plaintiffs requested that the mode of trial be by judge and jury. The claim \nbrought by the plaintiffs related to negligence and nuisance caused by EastLink (a toll road in Melbourne\u2019s eastern suburbs). The plaintiffs in the case were self-represented.\nThe defendants sought an order that \nthe trial be heard by a judge alone. The \ndefendants referred to the complex issues \nof law and fact, the large volumes of written material that needed to be considered, and \nthe length of time and resources that would be spent if the jury needed to be discharged.\nAssociate Justice Daly of the Supreme \nCourt, \u2018with some hesitation\u2019, dismissed the defendants\u2019 application. She decided she \nwould not lightly interfere with the right of a \nself-represented party to a trial by jury. Her Honour referred to the fact that previous jury trials were able to deal with complex and detailed evidence. LEGAL \nCASE\nSource 1 A jury box in the Supreme Court \u2013 there are six jurors in a \ncivil/uni00A0trial.\u2192 GOING FURTHER\nJury challenges\nThe parties have some influence over the composition of the jury. They can do this by challenging \nsome of the jurors before they are empanelled. The plaintiff and the defendant are entitled to a limited number of peremptory challenges each. Peremptory challenges are challenges without a reason. A/uni00A0peremptory challenge in a civil trial is made by striking the name or number of the potential juror from the list of persons to be selected to serve on the jury. There can be an unlimited number of challenges for cause; that is, challenges with a reason.\nRole of/uni00A0the civil/uni00A0jury\nThe role of  a civil jury is to consider the facts of  the case and decide who is most likely in the wrong. Their \ndecision is made on the balance of probabilities. If  a unanimous verdict cannot be reached (i.e. one \nin which all six jurors agree), then a majority verdict of  up to \ufb01ve out of  six will be accepted. If  present, \na civil jury may also be required to decide on the amount of  damages to be awarded. In defamation cases, only a judge can decide the amount of  damages.\nJurors are not required to give reasons for their decision (unlike a judge or magistrate). Therefore, the \nparties will not know the basis upon which the jurors have decided, or even know whether the jurors have \nunderstood the evidence, the legal issues, or the submissions made by the parties.\nLike criminal juries, there are obligations on civil juries in relation to gathering research and evidence. \nPenalties apply to jurors who make enquiries for the purposes of  obtaining information about anything related to the trial (for example, using the Internet to search for information, or viewing or inspecting a place that is relevant to the trial).\nIn conducting their role, juries are seen to ensure justice is administered in line with community \nstandards, rather than in line with the views of  a small number of  people (that is, judges). The use of  the jury system also enables the community to participate in the administration of  justice, which can enhance the con\ufb01dence of  the community that justice is being achieved.\nThe jury system also seeks to uphold equality and impartiality. It does this by ensuring that jury \nmembers have no knowledge of  a party or a witness, have no biases or preconceived notions, and are able to make a decision based on facts, and not based on any biased views that may be held by/uni00A0them.\nThe following legal case is an example of  a negligence case that was heard by a jury.unanimous verdict   \na verdict or decision \nwhere all the jury members are in agreement and decide the same way (e.g. they all agree the accused is guilty)/uni00A0\nmajority verdict   \nall but one of the \nmembers of the jury \nagr\nee with the decision\n13_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_3pp.indd   436-437\n4/10/2017   11:17 amChapter openers\nEach  chapter  begins  with  a chapter  opener  that includes:\nClear topic-based  approach\nContent  is sequenced  in structured  \ntopics  that are  aligned  to the Study \nDesign.

In civil cases, \nremedies are designed to  provide the plaintiff with a legal solution to  a breach of civil law by the defendant. \nThe most common remedy is known as damages (i.e. an amount of money that a court or tribunal orders \none party to  pay to  another). In April 2016, a US judge ordered BP to  pay US$20 billion dollars in damages \nfor the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill that took place in the Gulf of Mexico.

It does this by ensuring that jury \nmembers have no knowledge of  a party or a witness, have no biases or preconceived notions, and are \nable to make a decision based on facts, and not based on any biased views that may be held by/uni00A0them.\nThe following legal case is an example of  a negligence case that was heard by a jury.\nUSING ACCESS & JUSTICE\nUSING ACCESS & JUSTICE\nUSING ACCESS & JUSTICE\n326327\n CHAPTER 11 SANCTIONS\n UNIT 2 SANCTIONS, REMEDIES AND/uni00A0RIGHTSPolice can also arrest without a warrant any person reasonably believed to have committed an \nindictable offence either in Victoria or elsewhere which, if  committed in Victoria, would be an indictable \noffence. Police can use reasonable force when making an arrest, though what is reasonable force will \ndepend on the circumstances of  the arrest.\nAn individual, however, has certain rights in relation to an arrest, which ensures a balance between the \npower of  arrest and the rights of  an individual. For example:\n\u2022 An individual can refuse to attend the police station unless they are under arrest. This upholds a \nperson\u2019s right to freedom of  movement and right to liberty.\n\u2022 If  a person is arrested, under the Human Rights Charter they must be informed at the time of  arrest \nthe reason for the arrest, and be promptly informed about any proceedings that are to be brought \nagainst him or/uni00A0her.\n\u2022 The Human Rights Charter also states that an arrested person must be promptly brought before a \ncourt and have the right to be brought to trial without unreasonable/uni00A0delay.\n\u2022 A person does not need to say anything other than provide their name and address (it is an offence to \nrefuse to do/uni00A0so).\n\u2022 If  arrested, a person must be released (unconditionally or on bail) or brought before a bail justice or \nmagistrate in the Magistrates\u2019 Court within a reasonable time of  being taken into custody.

He has an addiction to the drug methamphetamine, also known as ice. Alex\u2019s use of the drug is so extensive that it costs him $500 per day. In order to \ufb01nd that amount of money, he planned on stalking people as they left Crown Casino, taking their money as they walked to their cars. Alex asked his mate, Ben, to assist in the commission of this offence. Ben is aged 20 years and is not a drug user.\nOne night a middle-aged couple, Renee \nand Tony, were walking along Clarendon Street at 10 pm when Alex emerged from the shadows, produced a \ufb02ick knife and demanded money. Renee escaped and ran down the street in the direction of Ben, who was waiting, armed with his knife. Fortunately for Renee, a taxi drove into a driveway in front of her and she screamed for help. Ben remained in the shadows, unnoticed.\nAfter Alex managed to grab Tony\u2019s \nwallet, he ran towards the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre, where he has earlier parked a stolen car. He headed towards Kings Way. Such was Alex\u2019s speed that his car swerved onto the wrong side of the road, where he struck and killed a cyclist who was riding without lights or a helmet.\nWhen presented at court, Alex pleaded \nnot guilty to all charges.

Two types of  \nagreements are:\n\u2022 an enterprise agreement\n\u2022 an individual contract.\nEnterprise agreements\nAn enterprise agreement is an agreement about wages and conditions between an employer and two \nor more employees. For this reason, enterprise agreements are also commonly known as collective agreements. Enterprise agreements effectively replace an award that is in place and create an enforceable set of  terms and conditions of  employment that covers those employees. The wages set out in the collective agreement must not be below the award wages, and are usually higher than those wages. The collective agreement must be approved by, and registered with, the Fair Work Commission so that it is publicly available and searchable.\nIndividual contracts\nAn individual contract is an agreement directly between an employer and the employee. Each contract \nis negotiated between the two parties and sets out the pay and conditions of  the employee. The wages again must not be below the award wages. The contract does not need to be approved by or registered by the Fair Work Commision. Individual contracts are popular with private sector companies such as accountancy \ufb01rms and law/uni00A0\ufb01rms.enterprise agreement  \nan agreement or contract about wages and conditions between two or more employees and their employer\nindividual contract \nan agreement between an employee and their employer relating to wages and work conditions (which is legally binding and enforceable at law)Workplace laws are essential to the employers and to the \noperation of  businesses. They protect the rights of  employees in the workplace. Many legal issues can arise from employment situations and can involve issues such as: \n\u2022 underpayment of  workers\u2022 workplace safety\u2022 bullying\u2022 discrimination and harassment.\nThe workplace is governed by various federal and state laws, \nwhich are designed to ensure the safety of  employees and to \npromote harmonious and cooperative work environments. Many of  these laws establish minimum requirements that employers must abide by in relation to an employee\u2019s pay and conditions.\nIn Australia, the main law that gov\n erns pay and work conditions \nis the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth). This and associated laws set out \nwhat employees should be paid, and what work conditions they \nare entitled to (e.g. annual leave, sick leave, working hours and lunch breaks). Most employees are covered by the Fair Work Act; one exception is employees who are employed by a state body such as a state \nelectricity/uni00A0body.\nPay and conditions in Australia\nUnder current laws, a person\u2019s pay can be determined by an award or an agreement and conditions.\nAward\nAn award is a document which sets out the wages that must be paid to a particular occupation or industry. \nThe award will also set out what overtime rates, penalties and allowances will be paid to an employee and the amount of  leave the person will receive.\nAn award is often seen as a \u2018safety net\u2019, because wages cannot fall below the amount set out in the \naward. The Fair Work Ombudsman, a government body which has online information for employers and \nemployees, allows people to \ufb01nd out what their minimum wage/uni00A0is.\nThe minimum wages are reviewed annually by an expert panel of  the Fair Work Commission.\nThe underpayment of  staff  can signi\ufb01cantly affect employer\u2013employee relationships as well as the \nreputation of  the organisation.Source 1 Young workers often need greater protection in \nrelation to workplace pay and conditions because they are underpaid more often than older workers.\naward the minimum wages and conditions that an employer is legally required to pay a worker for a particular job or occupation\nFair Work Ombudsman \na statutory body that promotes harmonious, productive and cooperative workplaces, investigates workplace complaints and ensures compliance with Australia\u2019s workplace laws\nFair Work Commission \nan independent national tribunal that has the power to establish the minimum wages and employment conditions for a particular job or industry\nAWARD\nSets the minimum wage\nNo need for contractENTERPRISE AGREEMENT\nBetween employer and \ngroup of employees\nApproved and registered with\nFair Work CommissionINDIVIDUAL CONTRACT\nBetween employer and \nemployee\nNo need to be approved\nor registered with\nFair Work Commission\nSource 2 The three main types of ways that a person\u2019s pay/uni00A0is/uni00A0set.\nFast food/uni00A0award\nAnastassia, 16, has started working at a local fish and chip shop as a casual worker.

The interaction between different people, groups and organisations can \noften result in civil law being broken, or rights being infringed. These everyday events often result in civil \ndisputes that need to be resolved.\nIf  a person\u2019s rights have been infringed, that person may be able to take action against the person they \nbelieve has done them wrong.\nIn civil law:\n\u2022 the plaintiff is the person who commences a civil action\n\u2022 the defendant is the person who is being sued. \nThe plaintiff  has the burden of proof in civil disputes, and may be able to use a variety of  dispute \nresolution bodies to be compensated for the infringement of  civil law.\nA plaintiff  and a defendant can be a human being, a company or an association. That is, companies \nand associations are entitled to certain rights, and owe certain obligations, and so can sue and be sued. An \nexample of  a company being sued is provided in the case study/uni00A0below. When a civil dispute is resolved, people expect that justice will be achieved. In  Chapter/uni00A0 11 you \nconsidered the principles of  justice in relation to criminal cases. The principles of  justice also apply to civil disputes, and can be used to determine whether justice has been achieved in the civil justice system, or in the resolution of  a civil dispute.\nIn this chapter you will look at the ways that civil disputes are resolved. Y ou will explore:\n\u2022 methods used to resolve civil disputes\n\u2022 the role of  tribunals, ombudsmen and complaints bodies in resolving disputes\u2022 the role and civil jurisdictions of  the Victorian/uni00A0courts\u2022 the roles of  the jury in a civil/uni00A0trial\u2022 remedies and their purposes.\nThe purpose of  these topics is so that you can develop an appreciation of  how civil disputes can be \nresolved, and the effectiveness of  dispute resolution bodies and remedies.\nCHECK YOUR LEARNING 13.1 \nDe\ufb01ne and explain\n1 What are the names given to the two parties in a civil \ndispute?\n2 What does it mean to sue somebody?\nSynthesise and/uni00A0apply\n3 Read the case study \u2018King Kong features in Supreme \nCourt/uni00A0claim\u2019.\na Who is the plaintiff  and who is the defendant in this \ncase?\nb What is the claim that is being/uni00A0made?c What loss or harm does the plaintiff  claim he has \nsuffered?\nd What sort of  claim is this (e.g. negligence, \ndefamation, contract)?Analyse and evaluate\n4 Y ou are on the train on your way back from a school \nexcursion and you overhear two people talking about \ncivil disputes. \nThe two people both work at the same company \nwhich is being sued by a colleague of  theirs.

Imagine playing \nin a tennis game or tournament without rules. Would you  know what  to do or expect? Would you  be \ntreated without discrimination? What  might happen if  you argued with your opponent during the game? \nRules help to resolve the con\ufb02icts that are  inevitable when people live  or interact in groups.\nThroughout our lives we  are bound by  rules. Some of  these are  laws (also known as legal rules). \nLaws are  generally made by  parliament and apply to all members of  society. They are  enforceable by  \nthe courts and any  individual that breaks certain laws may  receive a penalty (also known as a sanction). \nPenalties can include \ufb01nes or,  for a serious breach, spending time in prison. Laws made by  parliament are  \ngenerally referred  to as legislation, statutes, or Acts of Parliament.\nNon-legal rules\nThere are  also non-legal rules. School rules and rules of  games are  examples of  non-legal rules. Non-\nlegal rules are  made by  private individuals or groups in society. For  example, parents, schools and sporting \nclubs make rules that are  imposed upon the members of  that speci\ufb01c group (i.e. family members, students, \nor team members) so the group can operate in a peaceful and uni\ufb01ed manner. Non-legal rules are  not \nenforceable by  the courts but like laws they have  consequences. Any  member who  breaks a rule may  incur \na penalty imposed by  the group. For  example, a sporting club might suspend a member from participating \nin a scheduled game if  they missed a training session.\nWhy do we  need/uni00A0laws?\nEvery society has both legal and non-legal rules to regulate behaviour. The main aim of  the law  is to \nprotect our society and keep  it functioning. The law  has developed to protect individual rights and stop \nbehaviour that may  affect the peace and good \norder of  society. For  example, many different laws \nexist in Australia to protect people \u2013 individually, \nand in speci\ufb01c groups \u2013 from danger and abuse. \nThey cover areas including consumer, workplace, \nfamil\ny, environmental, and child protection laws, \nas well as anti-discrimination laws which make \nit unlawful to victimise, abuse or discriminate \nagainst another person on the basis of  their race, \nreligion or/uni00A0sex.\nWithout laws our society would be in chaos. \nLaws are needed to provide guidelines for \nacceptable behaviour and prevent con\ufb02ict.\nThe rule/uni00A0of/uni00A0law\nThe concept of  the rule of  law underpins much of  what  you will study in Legal Studies. The rule of  law \nmeans that everyone \u2013 individuals, groups and government \u2013 is bound by  and must adhere to laws, and rule of  law  \nthe principle that \neveryone in society is \nbound by law and must \nobey the law, and that \nlaws should be fair and \nclear, so people are \nwilling and able to  obey \nthem\ngovernment \nthe ruling authority \nwith power to  govern, \nformed by the political \nparty that holds \nthe majority in the \nlower  house in each \nparliament.

That  is, even  the people \nwho made the laws are  bound by  them. This includes our Prime Minister, our government departments, \nour judges and our public of\ufb01cials.\nAlthough you  may  not have  realised it, the principle of  the rule of  law is often mentioned in the media, \nin relation to international issues as well as issues here in Australia. \nFor example, in July  2017 the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, announced plans to introduce new  \nlaws to tackle crime on the \u2018dark web\u2019. The laws will force technology companies such as Facebook to \nhand over  encrypted messages to the police. This will help the government identify online criminal activity \nsuch as terrorism and child pornography. The Prime Minister said at  the time of  announcing the laws that \n\u2018the rule of  law must apply online as it does of\ufb02ine\u2019. This means the law  applies to everybody. A person \nshould not be able  to escape the legal consequences of  crime just because it occurs online.\nAs part of  this course, you  will come across a number of  principles designed to uphold the rule of  law. \nFor example, some of  the principles of  the rule of  law are as follows:\n\u2022 the law  must be clear, understood, known and enforceable. Yo u  will explore this further in Chapter/uni00A03\n\u2022 the law  must uphold the right that people are  presumed innocent until proven guilty. Yo u  will look at  \nthe presumption of innocence in Chapter/uni00A04\n\u2022 hearings and trials must be heard by  independent and impartial adjudicators. Yo u  will look at  the role \nof  the courts and judges in Unit 2 (Chapters/uni00A011 and/uni00A013)\n\u2022 the law  must be applied equally and fairly. Yo u  will explore the concepts of  fairness and equality \nfurther in Chapter/uni00A03, and throughout Unit/uni00A02. \nCHECK YOUR LEARNING 2.1 \nDe\ufb01ne and explain\n1 Make a list showing:\n\u2022 \ufb01ve/uni00A0laws\n\u2022 \ufb01ve non-legal/uni00A0rules\n\u2022 three customs or etiquette that are  neither laws nor \nnon-legal/uni00A0rules.\n2 Look at  Source 1.\na Make a list of  all the non-legal rules you  can think \nof  that apply in your own  school library.\nb Who will enforce the rules if  they are  broken?\nc What  is the likely consequence of  any rules being \nbroken?\nd Identify three other places that you  go to that have  \ntheir own  non-legal/uni00A0rules.\n3 Explain the different consequences that may  apply if  \nyou break a law  as opposed to a non-legal/uni00A0rule.4 What  is meant by  the rule of  law?

Being aware  of these themes and \nunderstanding them will help you to  connect the information you  learn in each unit of the course and \nplace it in a broader context. The  key themes are  discussed in Source/uni00A06.\nKEY THEME DESCRIPTION\nThe rule  of law The rule of law is the legal principle that:\n\u2022 all people and organisations (including the government) are \nsubject to  the same laws and should obey them equally\n\u2022 laws should be written in a way  that people agree with\n\u2022 laws should be written so that they can be obeyed.Many of the legal principles and structures you will learn about in the course are designed to  uphold the rule of law. These include the \npresumption of innocence, the role of the jury, and the right to  a fair \nand public hearing.\nThe principles of justice \u2018Justice\u2019 is a common concept and something that Australians often \nwant to  see being upheld \u2013 particularly when it comes to  serious \ncrimes that have been committed. In this course you will look at the three principles of justice:\u2022 fairness\n\u2022 equality\n\u2022 access .\nProblem-solving and application skillsA key  focus in this course is developing your problem-solving and \napplication skills. Legal Studies requires you to  consider a range of \nreal and/or hypothetical scenarios and apply your knowledge and skills to  those scenarios. You will consider areas of the law such/uni00A0as:\n\u2022 criminal cases and civil disputes\u2022 problems with the law and the legal/uni00A0system\u2022 problems with the way  in which our law-makers operate.\nIn each of these areas, you may be expected to  develop possible \nstrategies to  help resolve problems and issues.\nRecent focus An important part of this course requires you to  be up to  date with \nwhat is happening in Australia\u2019s legal system.  For example, in Unit/uni00A02 \nyou are required to  study a number of recent criminal and civil \ncases. In the context of the Legal Studies course, the word \u2018recent\u2019 means within the last four years. rule of  law \nthe principle that \neveryone in society is bound by law and must obey the law, and that laws should be fair and clear, so people are willing and able to  obey \nthem\nfairness \none of the principles of justice; fairness means having fair processes and a fair hearing (e.g. the parties in a legal case should have an opportunity to  know the \nfacts of the case and have the opportunity to present their side \nof events; and the pre-hearing and hearing (or trial) processes should be fair and impartial)\nequality \none of the principles of justice; equality means people should be equal before the law and have the same opportunity to  present \ntheir case as anyone else, without advantage or disadvantage\naccess \none of the principles of justice; access means that all people should be able to  understand \ntheir legal rights and pursue their case\nSource 6 K ey themes covered in VCE Legal Studies Units/uni00A01/uni00A0&/uni00A02\nCheck your obook assess for  these additional resources and more:\n \u00bb Video tutorial\nHow  to structure \nan/uni00A0essay \u00bb Weblink\nVCAA \u2013 current  \nStudy Design\n01_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   7 17/10/2017   12:21 PM",

If \nyou\u2019re going to perform at your best, you will need to make time for regular periods of study and revision outside school hours. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to study for hours every day, but it does mean you should incorporate short periods of revision into your daily routine. Studying daily will help you to continually reinforce new concepts in your mind and help you avoid the stress of last-minute cramming. Here are some tips to help you study e\ufb00ectively:\nChoose the/uni00A0best place to/uni00A0study\n\u2022 Ev eryone has their own idea about the best study environment. Whether it\u2019s in \nyour bedroom, at your local library, or at your favourite caf\u00e9, you need to \ufb01nd a regular study space that works for you. Ideally, your study space should be quiet, comfortable, bright and airy, and free from distractions.\n\u2022 Mak e sure your study space is stocked with the things that you need (such \nas stationery) and decorated with things that make you feel calm (such as artworks or plants).\n01_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   8 17/10/2017   12:21 PM",

If you know the year, you can look it up under \u2018Victorian numbered acts\u2019. However,  for your \npurposes, you will generally be citing the principal act anyway./uni00A0 Study/uni00A0tip\nA short video with tips and examples of how to cite legal cases and \nActs of Parliament is provided on your obook assess. Watch it to  help \ndevelop  your skills!Study/uni00A0tipCiting amending/uni00A0acts\nAmending acts are  a type of statute that amend (i.e. change or update) a statute that already exists. \nAmending acts are  repealed (i.e. cancelled) once the amendments are  made to  the existing statute.\nFor example, the Sentencing (Community Correction Order) and Other Acts  Amendment Act  2016 (Vic) is \nan amending act which amends the Sentencing Act  1991 (Vic), the Bail Act  1977 (Vic) and various other \nVictorian Acts. The  sole purpose of the Sentencing (Community Correction Order) and Other Acts  Amendment \nAct is to amend (i.e. change or update) those Acts. For  example, it might result in certain sections of the \nexisting Acts being deleted and added, or certain words or phrases being changed. \nAn amending act is cited in the same way  as other acts. Sometimes the title will let you  know that is \nan amending Act, as in the above  examples, but not always.  \nExample 3 \u2013 an/uni00A0amending act passed by/uni00A0the Victorian Parliament\nThis Amending act (i.e. the Sentencing (Community Correction Order) and Other Acts  Amendment Act ) was  \nmade in 2016 by  the Victorian Parliament.\nOnce the amending act has done its work, it is repealed, and it will no longer appear in the list of  \ncurrent acts. That  will occur once the changes it makes to  the principal act (the act it is amending) \ncommence. In this example, the Sentencing (Community Correction Order) and Other Acts  Amendment Act  \nstates that it will be repealed on 2 October 2018. That  is because the changes it makes to  various principal \nacts take  e\ufb00ect on 1 October 2018./uni00A0/uni00A0 \nCiting bills\nBills are  drafts of proposed laws  that have  been presented to  parliament but haven\u2019t been passed into law.  \nWhen citing bills, you  should adopt the same approach as Acts, except the word  \u2018Act\u2019 is replaced by  the \nword  \u2018Bill\u2019 , and the title of the bill is not italicised.\nExample 4 \u2013 a bill being presented to/uni00A0the Victorian Parliament\nThis Bill (i.e. the Disability Amendment Bill) was  presented in 2004 by  the Victorian Parliament.\nCiting legal/uni00A0cases\nLike acts, decisions from legal cases that are  heard in a tribunal or court also have  citations. Whenever \na written decision or judgment has been handed down by  a tribunal or court, it is given a citation so  that \npeople can refer back/uni00A0to/uni00A0it.\nLegal case citations generally feature the following pieces of information in this/uni00A0order:\n\u2022 The names of the parties \u2013 The name of the person who starts the case (usually called the \nplainti\ufb00, prosecutor or applicant) goes \ufb01rst.

Admission is a ceremony \nin the Supreme Court which takes place after extra time spent in practical training. The lawyer then \nneeds to be registered as a lawyer and obtain a practising certi\ufb01  cate from the Legal Services Board (the regulator in Victoria).

For example, some lawyers specialise in employment law, while others \nspecialise in mergers and acquisitions. \nHow did you first become interested in the law?\nI studied Legal Studies in my final year of high school and developed a passion for the law pretty directly as a result. I remember one conversation that clinched it for me \u2013 a Legal Aid duty lawyer at our local Magistrates\u2019 Court, who spotted me scribbling notes for a Legal Studies assignment, took the time to talk to me about the Mabo native title decision which had just been handed down by the High Court.

  "Page 42": "30  UNIT 1 GUILT AND LIABILITY2.1 THE MEANING OF/uni00A0LAWS\nIn any society, primitive or complex, it is necessary to have rules that govern family, social, political and \neconomic life to provide some form of social/uni00A0order.\nRules tell us what we can and cannot do or what we can expect in dealing with others. Imagine playing \nin a tennis game or tournament without rules. Would you know what to do or expect? Would you be treated without discrimination? What might happen if you argued with your opponent during the game? Rules help to resolve the con\ufb02icts that are inevitable when people live or interact in groups.\nThroughout our lives we are bound by rules. Some of these are laws  (also known as legal rules). \nLaws are generally made by parliament and apply to all members of society. They are enforceable by the courts and any individual that breaks certain laws may receive a penalty (also known as a sanction). \nPenalties can include \ufb01nes or, for a serious breach, spending time in prison. Laws made by parliament are generally referred to as legislation, statutes, or Acts of Parliament.\nNon-legal rules\nThere are also non-legal rules. School rules and rules of games are examples of non-legal rules. Non-legal rules are made by private individuals or groups in society. For example, parents, schools and sporting clubs make rules that are imposed upon the members of that speci\ufb01c group (i.e. family members, students, or team members) so the group can operate in a peaceful and uni\ufb01ed manner. Non-legal rules are not enforceable by the courts but like laws they have consequences. Any member who breaks a rule may incur a penalty imposed by the group. For example, a sporting club might suspend a member from participating in a scheduled game if they missed a training session.\nWhy do we need/uni00A0laws?\nEvery society has both legal and non-legal rules to regulate behaviour. The main aim of the law is to protect our society and keep it functioning. The law has developed to protect individual rights and stop \nbehaviour that may a\ufb00ect the peace and good order of society. For example, many di\ufb00erent laws exist in Australia to protect people \u2013 individually, and in speci\ufb01c groups \u2013 from danger and abuse. They cover areas including consumer, workplace, family, environmental, and child protection laws, as well as anti-discrimination laws which make it unlawful to victimise, abuse or discriminate against another person on the basis of their race, religion or/uni00A0sex.\nWithout laws our society would be in chaos. \nLaws are needed to provide guidelines for acceptable behaviour and prevent con\ufb02ict.\nThe rule/uni00A0of/uni00A0law\nThe concept of the rule of law underpins much of what you will study in Legal Studies. The rule of law means that everyone \u2013 individuals, groups and government \u2013 is bound by and must adhere to laws, and rule of law \nthe principle that everyone in society is bound by law and must obey the law, and that laws should be fair and clear, so people are willing and able to obey them\ngovernment \nthe ruling authority with power to govern, formed by the political party that holds the majority in the lower house in each parliament.

That  is, even  the people \nwho made the laws  are bound by  them. This includes our Prime Minister, our government departments, \nour judges and our public o\ufb03cials.\nAlthough you  may  not have  realised it, the principle of the rule of  law is often mentioned in the media, \nin relation to  international issues as well as issues here in Australia. \nFor example, in July  2017 the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, announced plans to  introduce new \nlaws to tackle crime on the \u2018dark we b \u2019.  The  laws  will force technology companies such as Facebook to  \nhand over  encrypted messages to  the police. This will help the government identify online criminal activity \nsuch as terrorism and child pornography. The  Prime Minister said at  the time of announcing the laws  that \n\u2018the rule of  law must apply online as it does o\ufb04ine\u2019 . This means the law  applies to  everybody. A person \nshould not be able to  escape the legal consequences of crime just because it occurs online.\nAs part of this course, you  will come across a number of principles designed to  uphold the rule of  law. \nFor example, some of the principles of the rule of  law are as follows:\n\u2022 the law  must be clear, understood, known and enforceable. Yo u  will explore this further in Chapter/uni00A03\n\u2022 the law  must uphold the right that people are  presumed innocent until proven guilty.

They  have  the oldest living \ncultural history in the world, dating back at  least 75 000 years.\nFollowing the arrival of the British, but before the twentieth century, the Commonwealth of Australia \ndid not exist. Instead, there were  six separate British colonies in Australia, each with a parliament able to  \nmake laws  for the residents of its own  colony.\nAs the colonies grew  throughout the 1800s it became clear that, in addition to  having separate \nparliaments in each colony, a central parliament was  needed to  make consistent laws  for the entire country.\nBy the 1880s the six colonies began formal discussions to  consider what laws  would be best made by  \na central parliament and what areas of law-making power should be kept  by the individual colonies. It \nwas considered best that a central parliament be given the power to  make laws  on national matters that \na\ufb00ected the whole country. These powers included laws  relating/uni00A0to defence, currency, postal services, \noverseas matters, and immigration and/uni00A0trade.\nIn the 1890s each of the colonies sent a group of representatives to  special meetings (called \nconstitutional conventions), where it was  decided that a new central Commonwealth Parliament would be \ncreated. On 1 January 1901, the date  celebrated as the anniversary of the Federation of Australia, the \nBritish Parliament passed a law  called the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act  1900 (UK). \nThe Australian Constitution\nThe Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act  is commonly known as the Australian Constitution or \nthe Commonwealth Constitution.\nA constitution is a legal document that outlines the basic rules of government and the law-making \npowers of the elected parliament (also known as the legislature).

Parliament can make law  in these areas. Examples of areas of exclusive power \ninclude defence forces and immigration.\n\u2022 concurrent powers \u2013 Powers  that are  shared between the Commonwealth Parliament and the state  \nparliaments, meaning both the Commonwealth and the state  parliaments can make law  in these areas. \nExamples of areas of concurrent powers include marriage and taxation.\n\u2022 residual powers \u2013 Powers  that were  not given to  the Commonwealth Parliament and belong solely \nto the states, meaning only the state  parliaments can make law  in these areas.

Therefore, the state  and Commonwealth \nparliaments can delegate their law-making powers to  subordinate authorities. These authorities can make \nminor laws  in their areas of expertise.

It describes social cohesion as the willingness of members of a society to cooperate with each other in order to survive and prosper. This means individuals are free to make choices in society, and are keen to cooperate with other members of society so that they may live in harmony.\nA society that is socially cohesive has a number of bene\ufb01ts. Its members are uni\ufb01ed and are provided \nwith opportunities in work, education and in their social life. People feel a sense of belonging, and individuals work together to challenge disharmony and to promote theirs and others\u2019 wellbeing.social cohesion \na term used to describe the willingness of members of a society to cooperate with each other in order to survive and prosper\nThe Scanlon-Monash Index of Social Cohesion provides an overview of the state of social cohesion in Australia every year. It considers five core areas of social cohesion:\n\u2022 belonging\u2022 worth\u2022 social justice \u2022 participation\u2022 acceptance and \nrejection.In 2016, Australia \nscored well in all \nof those areas but one: acceptance and rejection.Did you know?\nSource 1 Social cohesion is about individuals working together and living in harmony.\nIn addition to achieving social cohesion, a functioning society ensures that the rights of \nindividuals are protected. Individual rights are varied. They include rights to freedom of speech \nand freedom of religion, the right to vote and the right to silence. Individual rights are fundamental to a cohesive society. Without them, individuals may be manipulated or taken advantage of, and would have no recourse to justice.\nIn this topic you will explore the role of laws, individuals and the legal system in achieving social \ncohesion and protecting the rights of individuals.\nThe role of/uni00A0laws\nLaws provide guidelines on what is acceptable behaviour, and what is not. They set expectations about the way individuals should behave. For example, laws in Australia make murder a crime. If there were no such laws, some members of society might believe that killing another person is acceptable.\nLaws are fundamental to achieving social cohesion. They establish a framework in which people live, \nset boundaries for behaviour, and allow individuals to make choices about how they live. For example, some laws specify what we must do (e.g. pay for goods or services, respect others) and what we should not do (e.g. steal, interfere with a person\u2019s goods). Laws apply to everybody, regardless of their position in society. This principle that laws apply to all upholds the rule of law, which is a central part of our legal \nand political systems.\nLaws also protect the rights of individuals. A/uni00A0number of laws establish individual rights, and say what \nhappens if those rights are infringed. For example, a number of laws in Australia state that people must rule of law \nthe principle that everyone in society is bound by law and must obey the law, and that laws should be fair and clear, so people are willing and able to obey them\n03_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   38 17/10/2017   12:49 PM",

Consequences can occur if a person acts contrary to (inconsistent with) those/uni00A0laws.\nIn all societies, con\ufb02icts are inevitable. Laws also set \nout how disputes are resolved, so that they are resolved in a peaceful way. The penalty imposed or compensation awarded in cases help to prevent future con\ufb02ict, as people are aware of the consequences if they engage in unacceptable behaviour.\nThe role of/uni00A0individuals\nOnce laws are in place which enable social cohesion and protect the rights of individuals, it is the responsibility of individuals to ensure that they are aware of the laws, and abide by/uni00A0them.\nWhile no one person will know about every law in \nAustralia, or the source of those laws, it is the responsibility of every person to obey the law. Before taking any important action, they need to \ufb01nd out what the law is, particularly if it impacts on them. For example, a person who decides to open up a business is expected to familiarise themselves with laws about businesses, such as registering a business name, and obligations imposed on them to keep books and records for a certain period of/uni00A0time.\nFurther, individuals are expected to respect human rights, \nand not act in a way that is contrary to those rights. Doing so may lead to disharmony, and ultimately to a fractured society.\nIndividuals can also help to achieve social cohesion and \nprotect individual rights by assisting the police with their investigations, reporting crime, and using the legal system to resolve their disputes when their rights have been infringed. All of these acts help to ensure a society which is cohesive, and in which rights are upheld.\nThe role of/uni00A0the legal/uni00A0system\nThe legal system is a set of methods and institutions which makes, administers (implements) and enforces laws. It includes courts, tribunals, and enforcement bodies (e.g. Victoria Police) which aim to deal fairly and justly with individuals who have broken the law or breached someone else\u2019s rights.\nApplying the law and enforcing it are two of the roles of the legal system that help to achieve \nsocial cohesion and protect the rights of individuals when a dispute arises. For example, there is a law in Victoria which states that a person who sells goods to another guarantees that those goods are of an acceptable quality. If a vendor sells a TV that is defective and does not work, but then refuses to refund the purchaser or replace the TV , a dispute will arise which will need to be resolved. \nThere are a number of dispute resolution bodies, such as courts, which exist. The role of these bodies \nis to try and help people settle these disputes in a way that avoids further con\ufb02ict or disruption to society.Source 2 Laws set out rules on how disputes are resolved to \nensure they are resolved in a peaceful and consistent way.\nSource 3 Laws aim to ensure social cohesion. For example, traffic \nrules help to ensure a society in which people cooperate with each \nother on the/uni00A0roads.\n03_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   39 17/10/2017   12:49 PM",

  "Page 53": "41  CHAPTER 3  LEGAL FOUNDATIONSTHE PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE 3.2 \nThe word \u2018justice\u2019 is often used when people discuss \nlaws and the legal system. People recognise that laws should be fair, and that there should be justice when a law is broken. But what does justice/uni00A0mean?\nJustice is a di\ufb03cult concept to de\ufb01ne, and its \nde\ufb01nition can vary from person to person, and from society to society. For example, if a person who has a substance addiction steals money to buy illegal drugs, some people might think a just penalty is imprisonment. Others, however, might see justice achieved through a focus on the deeper social issues. That could mean a penalty that recognises that the reasons for the theft are related to substance abuse, considers the needs and circumstances of the o\ufb00ender, and aims to address the underlying reasons for the crime. This may be a penalty which requires the o\ufb00ender to seek assistance, like counselling and professional support, to overcome their substance addiction.\nWhen considering whether there is justice \nwhen a law has been broken or when a case needs to be resolved, rather than trying to apply a single de\ufb01nition, you should consider the following three principles:\n\u2022 fairness\n\u2022 equality\n\u2022 access.These three principles are known as the principles of justice, and should be used as a way to \ndetermine whether justice has been achieved in a particular/uni00A0case.\nFairness\nFairness is the \ufb01rst principle of justice. A/uni00A0dictionary de\ufb01nition is \u2018impartial and just treatment or behaviour \nwithout favouritism or discrimination\u2019 . But like justice, fairness can mean di\ufb00erent things depending on a person\u2019s values and perspectives.\nLaws must be fair. A/uni00A0law which allows big businesses to threaten small businesses when entering into \ncontracts would be considered unfair, as it would mean that one group with power in society is getting an unfair advantage over. Similarly, a law that makes imprisonment the penalty for jaywalking would generally be considered unfair, as the penalty would not \ufb01t the/uni00A0crime.\n When disputes arise, fairness means there are fair legal processes in place, and all parties receive a \nfair hearing. People should be able to understand court processes and have an opportunity to present their case and rebut (challenge) the other side\u2019s case, and the processes involved in determining a case should be fair and impartial.fairness \none of the principles of justice; fairness means having fair processes and a fair hearing (e.g. the parties in a legal case should have an opportunity to know the facts of the case and have the opportunity to present their side of events; and the pre-hearing and hearing (or trial) processes should be fair and impartial)\nequality \none of the principles of justice; equality means people should be equal before the law and have the same opportunity to present their case as anyone else, without advantage or disadvantage\naccess \none of the principles of justice; access means that all people should be able to understand their legal rights and pursue their case\nIn Unit 2, you will look at these principles more closely; however, you should have an understanding of what these principles are, and what they mean, in Unit 1. Start to refer to the principles of justice in your answers to questions in your assessment tasks when you are looking at different cases.

  "Page 54": "42 UNIT 1  GUILT AND LIABILITY The right to a fair trial or hearing is a right protected by the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities \nAct 2006 (Vic) (the Human Rights Charter), a law which aims to promote and protect human rights in \nVictoria. The right is also protected by the courts through a series of cases, which recognises that a fair trial is a fundamental part of our legal system. \nHowever, fairness doesn\u2019t just apply to the \ufb01nal trial or hearing \u2013 it applies to all aspects of our legal \nsystem, including our interaction with the police and our right to understand allegations made against us.\nFairness does not necessarily mean that people are treated the same \u2013 but if they are treated di\ufb00erently, \nit should be because of the laws that have been applied, and because of the circumstances of the case, and not because the person has been discriminated against because of a personal attribute or characteristic.\nEquality\nEquality is the second principle of justice. A/uni00A0dictionary de\ufb01nition is \u2018the state of being equal, especially in status, rights or opportunities\u2019 . It means all people should be treated equally before the law regardless of their characteristics or attributes, such as status, race, religion, marital status, or culture.\nLaws should not be discriminatory (they should apply to everyone, and not single out one group), and \nthere should be laws which prohibit discrimination against a person or group because of some particular characteristic.\nEquality in the legal system means that all people should be treated equally before the law. No person \nor group should be treated advantageously, or disadvantageously, and people should be given an equal opportunity to present their case. The processes should be free from bias or prejudice, and those who make the decision should be impartial when that decision is being made. This includes judges, who must act impartially, and jury members, who must be unbiased and have no links with the parties.\nEquality and fairness, while overlapping, are two di\ufb00erent concepts. The best way to contrast the two \nis by considering the following example.\njury \nan independent group of people chosen at random to decide on the evidence in a legal case and reach a decision (i.e. verdict)\nFire at shopping/uni00A0centre\nLate last year there was a major fire outbreak in a local shopping centre, and 40 people were \ninjured. The injuries ranged from severe to/uni00A0minor.\nA paramedic officer handed out gauze and bandages and had exactly 40 of each. He wanted to \ntreat everybody equally, and so decided to hand out one gauze and one bandage to each of the/uni00A040.\nA second paramedic officer disagreed with this and thought that this was unfair even though it \nwas equal treatment. The second officer believed that to be fair, they should hand out the gauze and \nbandages according to need, depending on the severity of a person\u2019s injuries. The first paramedic officer didn\u2019t like this. He thought that this would create inequality.EXAMPLEDesigner Note:/uni00A0Begin Topic 3.2 \u2013 THE \nPRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE - START NEW/uni00A0PAGE\nDesigner Note:/uni00A0Size:/uni00A04/uni00A0pages\nFairness and equality may need to be balanced. Sometimes it can be impossible to be perfectly fair and \nequal at the same time. For example, if you were handing out treats, everyone should get the same. That would be fair and equal. But in the above example, providing gauze and bandages based on the person\u2019s injuries would be fairer. People are not being treated equally (in the number of bandages) but other kinds of equality are also important. If the distribution was decided based on something other than injuries (say, the age or attractiveness of the injured people) it would mean some people would miss out simply because of some personal characteristic. Then there would be both inequality and unfairness.\n03_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   42 17/10/2017   12:49 PM",

  "Page 56": "44 UNIT 1  GUILT AND LIABILITYCHARACTERISTICS OF AN EFFECTIVE/uni00A0LAW 3.3  \nFor society to function properly and for there to be social cohesion, laws must be e\ufb00ective. To be e\ufb00ective, \nlaws must have the following \ufb01ve characteristics:\n\u2022 re\ufb02ect society\u2019s/uni00A0values\u2022 be enforceable\u2022 be/uni00A0known\u2022 be clear and understood\u2022 be stable.\nIf one of these characteristics is missing, then it is possible that the law is not as e\ufb00ective as it could/uni00A0be.\nLaws must reflect society\u2019s/uni00A0values\nFor a law to be e\ufb00ective, it must re\ufb02ect society\u2019s current values. If a law is in line with society\u2019s current \nvalues, then members of society are more inclined to follow that law than disregard it. This means that laws need to change when society\u2019s values change.\nFor example, in late 2016, changes were made to adoption laws in Victoria to allow couples to adopt \nchildren regardless of their sex or gender identity. This means that any two people who are living together as a couple, on a genuine domestic basis, are now able to adopt a child. Society\u2019s views and values about de facto relationships and same-sex couples have changed over time, and the law has also changed to recognise/uni00A0this.\nLaws must be enforceable\nAn e\ufb00ective law must be enforceable. That is, if people break the law, it must be possible to catch and \npunish them, or sue them in a civil case. If this is not possible, people may be less inclined to follow the/uni00A0law.\nImagine if there was a law which stated that it is an o\ufb00ence to dream of going on a holiday. Such a law \nwould be ine\ufb00ective, because the police could never \ufb01nd out whether people are breaking the/uni00A0law. \nOn the other hand, it is an o\ufb00ence in Victoria to behave in a disorderly manner in a public place while \ndrunk. This type of law is more likely to be e\ufb00ective because it requires the behaviour to occur in public; therefore, the behaviour is more likely to be visible to police o\ufb03cers and members of society, and the police will be able to enforce the/uni00A0law.\nLaws must be known\nFor a law to be e\ufb00ective, the public must know about it. If people do not know about a new law, they will not be able to follow/uni00A0it.\nIt is the responsibility of individuals to \ufb01nd out what the law is on any particular matter. If someone \nbreaks a law, saying \u2018I didn\u2019t know it was breaking the law\u2019 is not an acceptable answer. This principle is commonly expressed as \u2018ignorance of the law is no excuse\u2019 .\nHowever, law-makers also need to keep the public informed of any new laws that are passed. Major \nchanges in the law, or new laws, are usually reported in the media, and many are debated in the media and in society before they are introduced. For example, in 2015 a Victorian law was passed which requires every childcare facility to ensure that children who go to that facility have been immunised. The law, sue \nto take civil action against another person, claiming that they infringed some legal right of the plaintiff (or did some legal wrong that negatively affected the plaintiff)\npublic place \nan area or location considered open to the public (i.e. anyone in the community has a right to go there)In this Area of Study you are expected to assess the effectiveness of laws. Address each of the five characteristics when you are asked about whether a particular law is effective.

If \na law  is ambiguous, unclear, or written in language or in jargon \nthat people don\u2019t understand, it is possible people won\u2019t  follow \nit and the law  will be ine\ufb00  ective.  \n  For example, in some states of Australia, including \nQueensland, there have  been calls for  changes to  be made \nto abortion laws  which are  considered unclear, outdated and \nambiguous. Even though women in Queensland can receive \nan abortion, anybody who assists (such as a doctor) can be prosecuted under the Queensland  Criminal Code Act  1899 /uni00A0(Qld).    \nSource 1 Road laws in Australia are generally known because of \nvisible signage on/uni00A0roads.\nDecriminalising  abortion  laws\nIn some states  abortion is a  crime. Recent parliamentary debates in Queensland and New  \nSouth Wales have called for  abortion law reform. In these states, medical practitioners who \nprovide, or assist with, an abortion, can  be prosecuted under criminal law. This includes the \nwoman accessing the procedure herself, unless it  could be  proven  the pregnancy poses danger \nto the woman\u2019s physical or mental health.\nThe Medical Journal of  Australia published an article in October 2016 pressing for  reform. \nAuthors, Heather Douglas and Caroline de  Costa said \u2018Most Australian states  have introduced \nsignificant legislative modifications since 2000; however,  in NSW and Queensland, the \nlegislation, and specifically the offences, are  more than 100 years old  and well overdue for  \nreform\u2019. They also argued that these laws created fear and uncertainty about when an  abortion \nmight be considered legal or illegal. \nAbortion laws are  different in every  state  and territory. Douglas and de Costa argue for  the \ndecriminalisation  of abortion everywhere, and for  abortion to be  treated as a  health issue, not \na criminal matter. CASE \nSTUDY\nLaws must be stable\n  For a law  to be e\ufb00  ective, it must be stable. If the law  were  constantly changing, no one would be certain \nwhat the law  was,  and it may  not be as e\ufb00  ective as a law  that has remained constant for  some/uni00A0time.  \n  For example, there have  been very  few changes to  the law  relating to  theft in Australia. It has always  \nbeen a crime, and so  there is certainty that stealing is against the/uni00A0law.    decriminalisation  \nthe process of \nlegalising an act or behaviour which was previously considered a crime\n03_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   45 17/10/2017   12:49 PM",

This topic \nprovides you with an overview of the Commonwealth Parliament, the Victorian Parliament, government \nand opposition, and the courts.\nCommonwealth Parliament\nThe Parliament of Australia, otherwise called the Australian Parliament or the Federal Parliament, is a bicameral parliament. It consists/uni00A0of:\n\u2022 the Queen (often referred to as the Crown), represented by the Governor-General\u2022 the Senate (upper/uni00A0house)\u2022 the House of Representatives (lower house).\nThe role of the Commonwealth Parliament is to pass laws for the good government of Australia in its \narea of law-making powers.\nHouse of/uni00A0Representatives\nThe main roles of the House of Representatives are to represent the people, introduce and pass proposed \nlaws (bills), review bills passed by the Senate and form government. The political party that has the majority of members in the lower house will form government for the whole of Australia. Y ou will learn more about how bills are passed in the next topic.\nAt the federal level, each state is divided into geographical areas known as electoral divisions. \nEach division has approximately the same number of electors. The voters in each division elect their representative, who takes a seat in the House of Representatives. There are 150 electoral divisions in Australia, and therefore 150 members of the House of Representatives. All members of the House of Representatives are elected for a period of up to three years.\nSenate\nThe main roles of the Senate are to represent the interests of the states and territories of Australia, introduce and pass bills, and review bills passed by the House of Representatives. \nThe Senate consists of 76 senators. Each of the six states in Australia is represented in the Senate by \n12 senators, and each of the two mainland territories (Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory) is represented by two senators. All senators are elected for six years (except for the territory senators, who are elected for three years). A/uni00A0half-Senate election is held every three years (only half the senators stand for election). \nThe Senate is often called the house of review (because most bills are introduced in the House \nof Representatives and reviewed by the Senate) and the states\u2019 house (because each state has equal \nrepresentation).Source 1 The structure of the Commonwealth Parliament++=Queen's \nrepresentative \n(Governor-\nGeneral)Lower house \n(House of \nRepresentatives)Upper house \n(Senate)Commonwealth \nParliamentparliament \na formal assembly of representatives of the people that is elected by the people and gathers together to make laws\ngovernment \nthe ruling authority with power to govern, formed by the political party that holds the majority in the lower house in each parliament.

Sometimes, a political party will join forces with another political party to form government. This is known as a coalition. Historically at a federal level, political parties which have included the Liberal Party and the National Party have joined together to form government. The Prime Minister is the leader of the Federal Government (also known as the Commonwealth Government), and the Premier of Victoria is the leader of the Victorian Government. \nThe Premier of Victoria and the Prime Minister will choose senior members of his or her party \nwho have been elected to parliament (referred to as ministers) to be responsible for di\ufb00erent areas of \ngovernment, such as education and health. The Cabinet is made up of the Prime Minister and senior \nministers (at federal level) and the Premier of Victoria and senior ministers (at state level), and decides the government\u2019s policy program and what proposed laws should be put to the parliament.\nThe next largest political party will form the opposition, whose role it is to challenge and question the \ngovernment on policy matters. The opposition will also appoint some of its parliamentarians as \u2018shadow ministers\u2019 in various areas such as health and defence.

  "Page 63": "51  CHAPTER  3 LEGAL FOUNDATIONSSOURCES/uni00A0OF/uni00A0LAW 3.5 \nThere are  many laws  in Australia. They  can be classi\ufb01ed or grouped in di\ufb00erent ways,  including:\n\u2022 the source of  law  \u2013 (i.e. who made the law). In this topic you  will consider two  main sources of  \nlaw:/uni00A0statute law  (i.e. laws  made by  the parliament) and common law  (i.e. laws  made by  the courts).\n\u2022 the type of  law  \u2013 (i.e. what area the law  covers). In particular, this means the behaviour the law  is \ntrying to  regulate and the possible consequences if the law  is broken. In topic 3.7 you  will consider two  \ntypes of law:/uni00A0criminal law  and civil/uni00A0law.\nStatute/uni00A0law\nThe main role of parliament is to  make laws.  Laws  \nmade by  parliaments are  referred to  as statutes. \nStatutes are  also called Acts of Parliament or \nlegislation. Our parliamentary system is based on \nthe concept of  supremacy of parliament \u2013 this \nmeans that parliaments are  able to  override laws  \nmade by  other bodies, including the courts, and the \n\ufb01nal law-making power rests with the parliament.\nThe government generally decides what laws  \nshould be made, but the whole of the parliament is responsible for  passing the law.  If the government \ndecides a law  is needed, a bill is drawn up and \npresented to  parliament.\nBefore a bill can become law it must pass \nthrough both houses of parliament. It will go \nthrough a number of  stages  through each of the \nhouses, and must receive a majority vote  from the \nmembers of each house. \nMost bills are  introduced into the lower house \n\ufb01rst.

  "Page 64": "52 UNIT 1  GUILT AND LIABILITYCommon/uni00A0law\n  A court\u2019s primary responsibility is to apply existing laws to the facts in cases that are brought before them \nand make a determination (decision) on the case based on those laws. In this way, it is often said that the main role of courts is to apply the law to resolve the dispute at/uni00A0hand.   \n  As a secondary role, and as part of their determination of cases, courts also occasionally make laws. \nCourt-made law is known as common law, case law or judge-made/uni00A0law.  \n  Courts can make law in two situations or circumstances:  \n   \u2022      by interpreting the meaning of the words in a statute (or legislation) when applying them to a case the \ncourt is hearing (this is known as  statutory interpretation )    \n   \u2022      by deciding on a new issue that is brought before them in a case where there is no legislation in this \narea, or when a previous principle of law requires expansion to apply to a new situation.    \n  In each type of situation, because the court must still resolve the dispute, the judge will make a \ndecision and provide reasons for the decision. Common law is created through the reasons for decisions \nof courts, which are then followed by courts in future cases where the facts are similar.    \n  Interpreting statutes  \n  An Act of Parliament is often written in general terms to apply to all types of situations. Sometimes an unusual situation arises and the courts have to interpret words within the act. This process, where a judge clari\ufb01  es or interprets the laws written by parliament, is known as statutory interpretation.   \nSometimes the interpretation supports the prosecutor\u2019s case. At other times, the interpretation helps \nthe defendant, as in Deing v Tarola [1993] 2 VR 163.statutory \ninterpretationthe process undertaken by judges when they are required to give meaning to words or phrases in an Act of Parliament so it can be applied to resolve a case before/uni00A0itOne of the key skills you are expected to demonstrate in this Area of Study is your ability to classify a law according to its source and type.

  "Page 65": "53  CHAPTER 3  LEGAL FOUNDATIONSPrecedent\n  When a court makes a decision in a case that is the \ufb01  rst of its kind, and in doing so establishes or \ncreates a legal principle, the court is said to be setting a  precedent  . A/uni00A0precedent may be followed in \nsimilar cases that come before the courts in the future. These precedents then form part of the/uni00A0law.  \n  For example, imagine you were leaning back on your chair and your class teacher decided to \npunish you because your deliberate behaviour was unsafe and unacceptable. The teacher should, in an e\ufb00  ort to remain consistent, also punish other students who do the same thing in the future.  \n  However, if in a future case, another student accidentally trips another student in class, rather \nthan deliberately, the teacher may decide the two cases are di\ufb00  erent, and may choose not to punish the student in the second scenario in the same way as the others. In such a case, the teacher is distinguishing between the facts of the case at hand and the facts of the earlier case, in which the behaviour was deliberately unsafe. The most important aspect of the teacher\u2019s decision is the  reason   \ngiven for the decision \u2013 that deliberate unsafe behaviour is unacceptable. The precedent created in the past should be a guide to teachers in similar situations.  \nSimilarly, legal precedents are established through court decisions. The most important part of the \njudgment is the reason for the decision. This is known as the   ratio decidendi   .\n  The operation of precedent means that lower courts in the same court hierarchy will follow the \n ratio decidendi  in similar or like cases. This is known as  stare decisis  , meaning to stand by what has \nbeen decided.

Instead, Donoghue claimed the manufacturer of the ginger beer, David Stevenson, had been negligent in the washing of the bottles before filling them with ginger beer. She sued Stevenson, alleging he had failed in two ways:\n\u2022 It was the duty of the manufacturer to provide \na system which would stop snails from getting into \nhis ginger beer bottles.\n\u2022 It was the duty of the manufacturer to inspect the bottles \nbefore filling them with ginger beer and selling them to customers.LEGAL \nCASE\nMay Donoghue, the plaintiff, went to a caf\u00e9 where she was given a ginger beer.

  "Page 67": "55  CHAPTER 3  LEGAL FOUNDATIONSThe case below is an example of an Australian court following a British precedent. \nDr Grant\u2019s underpants\nGrant v Australian Knitting Mills Ltd \n[1936]/uni00A0AC/uni00A085\nA/uni00A0 man (Dr Grant) purchased a pair of long \nunderpants. When he wore them, he got a rash. He had the underwear tested and discovered that the chemical residue from the manufacturing process was still in the finished garment.\nAt this time, the \u2018buyer beware\u2019 principle applied \nto the purchase of all goods. It was the purchaser\u2019s responsibility to look for defects in goods before buying them. However, in this case the purchaser could not have detected the fault even if he inspected the goods. The Court followed the precedent set in Donoghue v Stevenson and ruled that the actions or omissions of the manufacturer directly caused Grant an injury and that the \u2018manufacturer owed a duty of care to the ultimate consumer\u2019.LEGAL \nCASE\nSource 4 Grant was affected by dermatitis \nfrom wearing a pair of long woollen \nunderpants.\nDeveloping or avoiding earlier precedents\n  There are four main ways courts can develop or avoid earlier precedents:  \n   \u2022      If the material facts of a case are su\ufb03   ciently di\ufb00  erent from the material facts in a binding precedent, a \nlower court may not have to follow the precedent. Instead they may  distinguish  the material facts in \nthe present case from those in the previous case and make a di\ufb00  erent decision. For example, a person \nfound in the front seat of a car, over the legal alcohol limit, with his keys in his hands was found guilty of being in control of a car while over the legal alcohol limit. The accused appeared to be about to drive the car. This case was distinguished from a previous case, where the accused was found asleep in the car with the engine running, trying to keep warm. He did not appear to be about to drive the/uni00A0car.   \n  \u2022      A precedent can be  overruled  by a higher court in a  di\ufb00  erent case . For example, the High Court \nmay overrule a decision of an earlier case decided in the Court of Appeal (which is lower than the High Court). When a precedent is overruled, it no longer applies.   \n  \u2022      A precedent can be  reversed   when the  same case  is taken to a higher court on appeal. For example, \na case may have been decided in the Supreme Court (Trial Division) and then appealed to the Court of Appeal (which is higher than the Trial Division), where the decision is changed. When a precedent is reversed, it no longer applies.    \n  \u2022      In some instances a court is bound by a precedent but expresses its disapproval of or disagreement \nwith the precedent. This is known as  disapproving . This does not change a precedent, but a higher court, when deciding a later case, may choose to agree with the court that disapproved of the precedent and decide to overrule it.      overruling a previous \nprecedentwhen a superior court changes a previous precedent, established by a lower court, in a different and later case thereby creating a new precedent which overrules the earlier precedent\nreversing a previous \nprecedentwhen a superior court changes a previous precedent set by a lower court in the same case on appeal, thereby creating a new precedent which overrides the earlier precedent\ndisapproving a \nprevious precedentwhen a court expresses dissatisfaction of an existing precedent but is still bound to follow it\n03_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   55 17/10/2017   12:49 PM",

The case against \nBucic was that he and a co-accused were in possession of a number of sheets of A4 paper \nimpregnated with cocaine, and that he and his co-accused took a number of steps to separate the cocaine from the paper. One of the issues that the Court had to decide was what was meant by the term \u2018manufacture\u2019, to determine whether Bucic was involved in manufacturing cocaine.\nManufacture was defined in the Act as including \u2018the process of extracting or refining \nthe prohibited drug\u2019. A/uni00A0further section in the Act states that a person takes part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug if the person takes part in any step, or causes any step to be taken, in the process of that manufacture.\nThe New South Wales Court of Appeal was required to determine what was meant by \nthe word \u2018manufacture\u2019, and found that the process of separating the cocaine from the paper was a process of extraction, and therefore the accused took part in the manufacture of the drug. Justice Campbell said, as part of his interpretation of the/uni00A0word:\nIt is interesting to note that none of the range of meanings attributed to the word \n\u2018manufacture\u2019 in either the Macquarie Dictionary or the Oxford Dictionary online editions LEGAL \nCASE3.6 THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN \nPARLIAMENT AND THE/uni00A0COURTS\nThe parliament and the courts have a complementary relationship. While the main role of parliament \nis to make laws, and the main role of courts is to resolve disputes, parliament and the courts need to work together to ensure laws are workable and enforceable.\nThere are four main features of the relationship between parliament and courts:\n\u2022 the interpretation of statutes by/uni00A0courts\n\u2022 the codi\ufb01cation of common/uni00A0law\u2022 the abrogation of common/uni00A0law\u2022 the ability of courts to in\ufb02uence parliament.\nEach of these is explored below. \nStatutory interpretation\nOne of the main features of the relationship between parliament and courts is that parliament creates \nstatutes, and courts interpret/uni00A0them.\nFor legislation to be e\ufb00ective, courts must apply the statutes to the cases before them. To do this, \nit is sometimes necessary for a court to interpret the meaning of the words in a statute or secondary \nlegislation (which is made by bodies that have been given their law-making power by parliament through an Act of Parliament. These bodies include local councils).\nDecisions by courts about the meaning of the words in statutes form precedents that become part of \nthe law to be followed in the future, as illustrated in the legal case below.secondary legislation \nrules and regulations made by secondary authorities (such as local councils, government departments and secondary authorities) which are given the power to do so by the parliament.

For  example, where a  person assists or encourages another person to  commit an \noffence, they can  be charged as well. Previously, common law set down the principles as to  \nwhen someone might be complicit in a/uni00A0crime.\nIn 2014 the Victorian Parliament passed laws that amended the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic).  \nThe amendments codified most of the common law principles in relation to  complicity.CASE \nSTUDY\nAbrogation of common/uni00A0law\nParliament, as the supreme law-making body, is able to  \nchange or override (abrogate ) common law.  It does this \nby passing a law  which speci\ufb01cally abrogates  or abolishes \nthe common law  principle.\nParliament  may  decide  to do  this  for a number  of \nreasons.  On occasion,  the courts  may interpret  the \nmeaning  of the  words  in a statute in  a way  that was  \nnot the intention  of parliament,  or in  a way  that does  \nnot re\ufb02ect  the current  meaning  of the  act.

This followed an old  common law \nprinciple inherited from Britain that allowed animals to  roam/uni00A0free.\nJustice Mason/uni00A0said:\nEven though there have been changes in  conditions and circumstances, there are  powerful \nreasons for  the court to  be reluctant to  engage in changing the rule; such law-making \nshould be left to  parliament.\nThe Victorian Parliament subsequently passed the Wrongs (Animals Straying on Highways) \nAct 1984 (Vic), which abolished the common law immunity and made owners of land liable for  \ndamage negligently caused by their animals straying on highways.LEGAL  \nCASEAbility  of/uni00A0courts to/uni00A0influence parliament\nCourts  can also  in\ufb02uence  changes  in the law by parliament  through  their  comments  made  during  \ncourt  cases.  That is,  they  can make  the need  for a change  in the law known  to parliament  through  \ntheir  decisions.\nCourts  might want  to do  this  for a number  of reasons.  For example,  they may  indicate  in a \njudgment  that they  think  the law should  be changed  by parliament.  Courts  may  be reluctant  to \nchange  the law themselves.  This  could  be because the  judge  thinks  parliament  is in a better  position  \nto look  at a wider  area  of law.  Parliament  can carry  out investigations  that courts  cannot.  Even  so, \nstatements made  by a judge  within  a court  decision  may  in\ufb02uence  parliament  to change  the law.\nThis  occurred  in the case  of State  Government  Insurance  Commission  v Tr ig well  (1979)  142 CLR/uni00A0617.Abrogation  of common  law wilful  exposure\nWilful exposure was  an offence created over  the years through the courts. Wilful exposure \nmakes it an  offence for a  person to  unlawfully, wilfully and publicly expose his naked person. It  \nwas a limited offence, in  that it was  limited to  exposure by a  man of  his penis, and did not make \nany sexually suggestive acts beyond exposure a crime.\nA review by the Department of Justice in 2013 of sexual offences recommended that the \noffence be abrogated, as the offence would no longer be necessary if a  proposed new  sexual \noffence law was created.\nIn 2016 the Victorian Parliament passed a  law which amended the Crimes Act. A/uni00A0new  Section \n54C was  inserted into the Crimes Act, which states  that \u2018the offence of  wilful exposure at  common \nlaw is abolished\u2019. In addition, new  sexual offences were  created as part of the amendments, \nincluding a new offence prohibiting sexual exposure.CASE \nSTUDY\n03_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   59 17/10/2017   12:49 PM",

Hughes \nbrandished a knife at her mother, repeatedly trying to stab her in the chest and neck. Hughes told her mother that she didn\u2019t want to kill her, but the voices were telling her that she had to do it, and that if she didn\u2019t, \u2018they\u2019 would burn the house/uni00A0down.\nAfter about an hour, Hughes\u2019 mother managed to escape. Hughes followed her and again \nattacked her as she ran into the driveway. A/uni00A0neighbour managed to disarm Hughes.\nHughes pleaded guilty to four charges:/uni00A0 false imprisonment, intentionally causing injury, \nmaking threats to kill, and reckless conduct endangering/uni00A0life.\nHughes was sentenced in the County Court of Victoria on 8 November 2016, at which time \nHer Honour Judge Hampel stated that this was \u2018one of the saddest cases of violence within a family that I/uni00A0have had to deal with\u2019. Hughes was sentenced to a term of 18/uni00A0months in prison.  Hughes had already been in custody for 346/uni00A0days, which Judge Hampel reckoned to be a period of imprisonment already served and which was to be deducted from the sentence. In addition, Hughes was required to serve a community corrections order (a type of sanction served in the community) for a period of 30/uni00A0 months. Several conditions were imposed as part of the community correction order, including a requirement that Hughes undergo assessment and treatment including testing for drug abuse or dependency as directed, and a requirement that she must not commit another offence while the order is in/uni00A0force.LEGAL \nCASEOther than classifying laws by their source, laws can also be classi\ufb01ed based on the behaviour they are trying to regulate and the possible consequences involved if the law is broken.\nThere are two main types of laws in Australia that regulate behaviour:/uni00A0criminal law and civil/uni00A0law.\nCriminal/uni00A0law\nCriminal law is a body of law which protects the community by establishing crimes and setting down sanctions for people who commit crimes. A/uni00A0 crime is an act or omission that breaks an existing law, \nharmful to an individual or society as a whole and punishable by law. Examples of crimes include murder, theft and assault.\nOne of the distinct features of criminal law is the consequence that can \ufb02ow if a crime is committed. \nIf a crime is committed, and a person is guilty of that o\ufb00ence, a sanction may be imposed on that person. The sanction could be minor, such as paying a small \ufb01ne, or could be more serious, such as imprisonment.\nIn a case involving criminal law, there are two parties:/uni00A0the state, which brings the action against the \nperson alleged to have committed the crime (represented by the prosecution), and the accused.\nAn example of a criminal case is DPP v Hughes [2016] VCC 1762 (8 November 2016), in which the \nCounty Court of Victoria handed down a sentence for a crime involving a mother and a daughter.criminal law \nan area of law that defines a range of behaviours and conduct that are prohibited (i.e. crimes) and outlines sanctions (i.e. penalties) for people who commit them (as opposed to civil law)\ncrime \nan act or omission that is (1) against an existing law, (2) harmful to an individual or society as a whole, and (3) punishable by law\nsanction \na penalty (e.g. a fine or prison sentence) imposed by a court on a person guilty of a criminal offence\n03_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   61 17/10/2017   12:49 PM",
  "Page 74": "62 UNIT 1  GUILT AND LIABILITYCivil/uni00A0law\nCivil law is an area of law that regulates disputes between individuals and groups and seeks to \nenforce rights where harm has occurred. Examples of areas of civil law include tort law (negligence, defamation, trespass and nuisance) and contract law. Civil disputes are private disputes, and do not involve the police or the state (unless the state government is a party to the civil dispute, which can occur). The two parties to a civil dispute are the plainti\ufb00 (being the party who makes a claim), and the defendant (who the plainti\ufb00 alleges has infringed the plainti\ufb00\u2019s rights).\nThe main aim of civil law is to remedy  a civil wrong, by returning the person whose rights have \nbeen infringed to their original position. This is done through civil remedies.

In 2015, Bauer Media, \nwhich publishes well-known magazines such as Woman\u2019s Day, The Australian Women\u2019s Weekly \nand Harper\u2019s Bazaar, published articles about Rebel Wilson, which she claimed contained false \nstatements about her. In particular, the articles claimed that Rebel Wilson had lied about her age and many parts of her upbringing. \nRebel Wilson sued the publisher for defamation, a type of civil law which aims to protect \npeople\u2019s reputation and character from false statements. She claimed that as a result of the articles she had lost the opportunity to earn income by acting in feature films during a period after the publication of the articles. Bauer Media denied the claim and the case went to trial before a jury, which lasted three weeks.\nIn June 2017 a jury found in favour of Rebel Wilson, deciding that she had been defamed in \nthe articles. In September 2017, Justice Dixon awarded over $4.5 million in damages to Wilson, who had earlier suggested she would donate the money to charity or scholarships.\nWilson and many parts of the film industry have considered the claim a victory over \npublishers which they believe often publish false stories about celebrities.\nSource 2  Rebel Wilson successfully sued Bauer Media after it published articles about her which \nruined her reputation.

  "Page 80": "68 UNIT  1 GUILT  AND LIABILITY3.9 THE VICTORIAN COURT HIERARCHY\nThe law provides individuals in society with guidelines for  acceptable behaviour. Most people grow  up \nwith an understanding that for  people to  live in harmony, they must obey the law.  In any  society, however, \nthere are  people who break the law  and infringe other people\u2019s rights.\nThe court system provides a means of resolving disputes and enforcing the law  peacefully and without \nresorting to  violence. It includes a variety of courts that have  di\ufb00erent areas of expertise and are  suitable \nfor di\ufb00erent types of cases.\nAs you  have  learnt, the main Victorian courts are  as follows:\n\u2022 the Magistrates\u2019/uni00A0Court\n\u2022 the County/uni00A0Court\n\u2022 the Supreme Court, which is divided into two  divisions:/uni00A0the Trial Division and the Court of Appeal.\nThere are  also two  specialist courts:/uni00A0the Coroners Court (which investigates suspicious deaths and \n\ufb01res) and the Children\u2019s/uni00A0Court (which deals with criminal and family matters involving children).\nThe Victorian courts are  ranked in a court hierarchy with the higher courts hearing the more serious \nand complicated cases and the lower courts dealing with the everyday issues. The  Victorian court \nhierarchy extends from the Magistrates\u2019 Court (the lowest state  court) to  the Supreme Court (the highest \nstate  court). The  High Court is a federal court, but it can hear appeals from the Supreme Court (Court of  \nAppeal). In fact, the High Court can hear appeals from courts in every  Australian/uni00A0state.\nEach of the courts has its own  jurisdiction, which is the right or power of a court to  hear or deal with \nparticular cases. Most of the courts in Victoria have  the jurisdiction to  hear both civil and criminal cases, \nand some courts have  the power to  hear appeals. For  example, the Magistrates\u2019 Court can hear minor \ncriminal o\ufb00ences, and the Supreme Court can hear serious o\ufb00ences such as murder. Yo u  will learn more \nabout the jurisdiction of courts in Unit/uni00A02.jurisdiction \nthe lawful authority (i.e. power) of a court, tribunal or other dispute resolution body to decide legal cases\nSource 1 The Victorian court hierarchy, which includes the High Court (a federal court)High Court of Australia \n(Federal Court) \nSupreme Court of Victoria \nCounty Court of Victoria Court of Appeal\nTrial Division\nMagistrates\u2019 Court of Victoria Children\u2019s Court Coroners Court VICTORIAN HIERARCHY OF COURTS\nReasons for/uni00A0a court hierarchy\nThere are  four main reasons for  a court hierarchy:\n\u2022 T he court hierarchy allows for  specialisation or expertise,  with the courts developing expertise in  \ndealing with the types of cases that come before them. For  example, the Magistrates\u2019 Court hears minor  \no\ufb00ences, and so  will be specialised in o\ufb00ences such as drink driving. The  Supreme Court hears serious  \no\ufb00ences such as murder, and so  will have  developed expertise around the principles relating to  murder.A practice assessment task for Unit 1 \u2212 Area of Study 1 can be found on the Unit 1 Assessment tasks topic on page 290.

  "Page 81": "69  CHAPTER  3 LEGAL FOUNDATIONS\u2022 The court hierarchy enables the parties \nto a court case to  appeal to  a higher \ncourt if they are  not satis\ufb01ed with the \ndecision in a lower court. This means \nthat a person who believes that an error has been made in the lower court can appeal the case to  a higher court for  the \nhigher court to  review that decision.\n\u2022 The court hierarchy is a necessary part \nof the doctrine of precedent (law-\nmaking through courts) because the \nprocess of law-making through courts depends on a decision being made in a higher court which is binding on lower courts. This enables individuals and lawyers to  predict the likely outcome of a case.  Judges and \nmagistrates can be guided by  the wisdom of the more experienced judges in the higher courts.\n\u2022 Finall y, a court hierarchy allows for  administrative convenience. Because the courts have  di\ufb00erent \njurisdictions to  hear di\ufb00erent matters, it allows smaller and minor cases (of which there are  more) to  \nbe heard in the Magistrates\u2019 Court (of which there are  a number in the state), and more complex and \nlarger cases to  be heard in the County Court and the Supreme Court.

Behaviour considered \nharmful to society is classi\ufb01ed as a criminal wrong and embodied in the criminal law. As you have learnt in Chapter 3, criminal law is a body of law that aims to protect the community by de\ufb01ning what is considered a crime and outlining penalties (i.e. sanctions) for people who commit crimes.\nPurposes of/uni00A0criminal/uni00A0law\nCriminal law has several purposes. It aims/uni00A0to:\n\u2022 protect individuals \u2013 Criminal law aims to protect us as human beings. It does this by establishing \ncrimes, and by establishing processes and sanctions to punish people who commit those crimes \n\u2022 protect property \u2013 Criminal law protects the things we own as individuals, and the things we own \ntogether as public property. This includes land and personal property. People are not free to deceive \nand steal what belongs to others or damage property or the environment \n\u2022 protect society \u2013 Criminal law allows the physical, social and \ufb01nancial aspects of society to \nfunction. For example, criminal law prohibits the manufacture, distribution and use of certain types of drugs, to ensure that we do not live in a society where too many people are adversely a\ufb00ected by illegal substances\n\u2022 maint ain public order and security \u2013 Criminal law sets standards and makes clear what behaviour \nwill not be tolerated by the community and the legal system. It makes social interactions predictable and maintains public order.

People would need to protect \nthems elves, and the weaker members of society would be in danger from those who were physically stronger.\nHow criminal law achieves its purposes\nThe criminal justice system works in four main ways./uni00A0It:\n\u2022 establishes the law \u2013 through statutes made by parliament and through court decisions\n\u2022 enforces the law \u2013 through Victoria Police and other bodies given power to enforce criminal/uni00A0law\n\u2022 decides who is guilty \u2013 through the courts\n\u2022 impo ses sanctions on o\ufb00enders \u2013 which aim, among other things, to punish o\ufb00enders and deter \nothers from committing crime.\nCriminal law \ufb01rst developed through common law. Now, however, most of the criminal law is found in \nActs of Parliament. All criminal laws function in the same way, in that they establish what is unacceptable \nbehaviour and what penalty may be imposed if a person engages in that behaviour.\nWhen a person has been found guilty of an o\ufb00ence, the court may impose a range of sanctions (e.g. \ngiving undertakings, \ufb01nes or prison). \nIn this chapter you will explore key concepts of criminal law, such as the presumption of innocence, the \nburden of proof and standard of proof. Before you do so, it is useful to consider what is meant by a crime.\nDefining a/uni00A0crime\nA crime is de\ufb01ned as an act or omission that/uni00A0is:\n\u2022 against an existing/uni00A0law\u2022 harmful to an individual or society\u2022 punishable by/uni00A0law.\nUnderstanding acts and omissions\nBefore we look at these features of a crime, we \ufb01rst need to understand what is meant by the terms \u2018act\u2019 \nand \u2018omission\u2019 . In legal terms, a crime can be committed by doing something (i.e. an act), or failing to do something (i.e. an omission). These acts or omissions are both things that society considers to be wrong. The example below will help you understand the di\ufb00erence.statute law   \nlaw made by parliament; also known as legislation or Acts of Parliament (as opposed to common law)\ncommon law  \nlaw made by judges through decisions made in cases; also known as case law or judge-made law (as opposed to statute law)\nSeparating an \u2018act\u2019 from an \u2018omission\u2019\nAn act: Sarah was invited to a friend\u2019s place for a party. While she was there, she stole a diamond \nnecklace belonging to her friend\u2019s mother.\nThe Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) outlaws the act of theft, and states that theft has a maximum penalty \nof 10/uni00A0years in prison.\nAn omission: Last year Sarah\u2019s sister was pregnant. The baby was premature, and Sarah\u2019s mother \nhelped her give birth, but the baby was stillborn. The family held a quiet burial in their backyard and told no one what had happened.\nThe Crimes Act makes it an offence to fail to report the death of a stillborn child or a child at \nbirth. This crime (an omission) has a maximum penalty of six months in prison.EXAMPLE\n04_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   75 17/10/2017   1:00 PM",
  "Page 88": "76 UNIT 1  GUILT AND LIABILITYAgainst an existing law\nFor a crime to be committed, it must be an act or omission that is prohibited (not allowed) by a law that \nis currently in existence (i.e. not a law that has since been cancelled). The parliament and the courts will establish laws that make acts or omissions a crime, and parliaments can also abrogate  (cancel) \nlaws that used to make behaviour a crime. For example, the Crimes Act makes it a crime to steal another person\u2019s property.\nHarmful to/uni00A0an individual or society\nA criminal act or omission has an impact on both the victim and society. The harm to a victim may be physical, \ufb01nancial or psychological (or a combination of these types of harm). Crimes have a negative impact on society, because they go against what most people believe is acceptable behaviour. Even a crime that is a \u2018victimless crime\u2019 can harm society as a/uni00A0whole.\nExamples of acts that are harmful to society include:\n\u2022 assault \u2013 For the victim, physical injuries cause pain, su\ufb00ering and time o\ufb00 work, as well as distress to their family. Someone who has been assaulted can also have long-term psychological issues. For society, expensive resources such as hospitals, police services, courts and prisons need to be available to address the consequences of criminal behaviour\n\u2022 taking illegal drugs \u2013 This is often referred to as a victimless crime, as the o\ufb00ender is only \nharming himself or herself. However, the use of illegal drugs is known to have a broader impact on the community, often leading to an escalation in theft and violent crimes\n\u2022 unruly behaviour \u2013 Anti-social behaviour such as swearing or being drunk in a public place may \nnot result in injury or damage, but it does have an impact on the general public\u2019s enjoyment of shared spaces and people\u2019s feelings of goodwill towards others in society.\nPunishable/uni00A0by/uni00A0law\nVictoria Police is the main government agency with the power to enforce the criminal law in Victoria.

  "Page 90": "78 UNIT 1  GUILT AND LIABILITYTHE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE 4.2 \nThe presumption of innocence is an important feature of the criminal justice system. It is a guarantee \nto a person accused of a crime that they are entitled to be treated as, and considered to be, innocent until \na charge against them is proved beyond reasonable doubt. Beyond reasonable doubt is the standard of proof for the prosecution to prove that the accused is guilty.\nThe presumption of innocence means that if a person is accused of a crime, that person does not have \nto prove he or she is innocent. It is the job of the prosecutor to prove the accused is guilty, as illustrated in the example below. The accused can stay silent and \u2018put the prosecution to its proof\u2019 (i.e. say nothing and make the prosecution establish its case by presenting reliable and relevant evidence to prove guilt).\nIt is up to a magistrate (for minor crimes) and the jury (for serious crimes) to impartially consider the \nstrength of the evidence and decide whether a person is guilty beyond reasonable/uni00A0doubt.presumption of \ninnocence  the right of a person accused of a crime to be presumed not guilty unless proven otherwise\naccused  \na person charged with a criminal offence\nbeyond reasonable doubt  the standard of proof in criminal cases.

Items stolen included six valuable Rolex watches. \nThe police were unable to immediately identify the offenders. Ted was charged with the crime./uni00A0 \nTed refused to say where he bought his watch. In the Magistrates\u2019 Court, the prosecution could only \nprove that Ted had a watch and that the shop had lost six watches. It could not prove any connection between Ted\u2019s watch and the six that were stolen from the shop. Ted was presumed innocent until proven otherwise. The Magistrate found that there was insufficient evidence. The Court found Ted not guilty of theft.EXAMPLE\nThe presumption of innocence is a protection against wrongful conviction. It has stood the test of \ntime. In the eighteenth century, Lord Blackstone, an English judge, declared \u2018it is better that ten guilty men should escape than one innocent man should su\ufb00er\u2019 . Today, the presumption of innocence is protected as a human right in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966, which Australia has signed. It is also protected in the Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic), referred to as the Human Rights Charter or the Victorian Charter of Human Rights. \nIn Australia (and other countries based on English law) a person is found \u2018guilty\u2019 or \u2018not guilty\u2019 . They \nare not found \u2018innocent\u2019 . Often people who are interviewed in the media after a trial say they have \u2018been exonerated\u2019 because they received a \u2018not guilty\u2019 verdict, but this is not true. All a not guilty verdict says is that the prosecution did not have enough evidence to make a case.\nProtecting the/uni00A0presumption of/uni00A0innocence\nThe presumption of innocence is a key concept in criminal law. The following features of the criminal justice system all help to ensure that the presumption of innocence is protected for a person accused of a/uni00A0crime:\n\u2022 The burden of proof is on the prosecution. \n\u2022 The case against a person must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. \u2022 Most crimes require a person to have acted of their own free will. \u2022 Police must reasonably believe a person has committed a crime before they can arrest them.\n04_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   78 17/10/2017   1:00 PM",

  "Page 92": "80 UNIT 1  GUILT AND LIABILITYKEY CONCEPTS OF CRIMINAL/uni00A0LAW\nA number of key concepts in criminal law help to ensure fair outcomes in criminal cases. These include:\n\u2022 the elements of a crime:/uni00A0actus reus and mens/uni00A0rea\u2022 strict liability\n\u2022 the age of criminal responsibility\u2022 the burden of/uni00A0proof\u2022 the standard of/uni00A0proof.\nElements of/uni00A0a/uni00A0crime\nA general principle in criminal law states that there is no guilty act without a guilty mind. Generally, \nand with the exception of strict liability crimes, every crime has two elements:\n\u2022 actus reus \u2013 a Latin term meaning \u2018guilty/uni00A0act\u2019\n\u2022 mens rea \u2013 a Latin term meaning \n\u2018guilty mind\u2019 .\nAccording to this principle, both \nelements of a crime (i.e. actus reus and \nmens rea) must be present at the same time for a crime to be committed.\nActus/uni00A0reus \nActus reus is the physical element of a crime. It refers to the actions (or inactions) that a person needs to engage in to be found guilty of an o\ufb00ence. \nThe  nature of the guilty act depends on the nature of the crime. For example, the o\ufb00ence of stalking, \nwhich is an indictable o\ufb00ence, can be committed if a person undertakes a certain type of action such as following the victim, or even tracing the victim\u2019s use of the internet. \nMens/uni00A0rea\nMens rea is the mental element of a crime. It refers to the person\u2019s state of mind when they were engaging in the actions or inactions (i.e. the actus reus). The mens rea is often expressed using words such as knowingly, \nintentionally, maliciously, recklessly, negligently and wilfully.\nThe nature of the mental element will again depend on the nature of the crime. For example, it is a \ncrime to make use of a \ufb01rearm when resisting arrest. The mens rea that is required to be found guilty of this o\ufb00ence is intention;/uni00A0that is, the person needs to intend to resist arrest when using the \ufb01rearm.\nHow to determine the actus reus and mens rea of a crime is explored further below. \nIdentifying the/uni00A0specific elements of/uni00A0a/uni00A0crime\nToday, most crimes and their elements are de\ufb01ned in Acts of Parliament (though some crimes, like murder, a\ufb00ray and common law assault, have common law de\ufb01nitions, meaning that the de\ufb01nition of the crime and its elements will be found through cases). /uni00A0 \nThe speci\ufb01c elements of a crime are important in determining whether a person will be charged with \nand found guilty of that crime. For a person to be found guilty, the prosecution must prove all elements of the crime beyond reasonable doubt. \nThe following extract provides the de\ufb01nition of two crimes contained in the Crimes/uni00A0Act.actus reus  \na Latin term meaning \u2018a guilty act\u2019; the physical element of a crime (i.e. the act itself).

See also actus reus\nstrict liability \nwhere culpability or responsibility for committing a crime can be established without having to prove there was mens rea (i.e. a guilty mind) 4.3 \nEach of these five key concepts in criminal law is listed in the VCE Legal Studies Study Design. This means you may be asked a question in your internal assessment tasks on any one of them. If you are asked a question about these concepts, make sure you are able to use the correct legal terminology, such as mens rea and actus/uni00A0reus.Study tipSource 1 The general elements of a/uni00A0crime+ =actus reus\n(a guilty act)mens rea\n(a guilty mind)Crime\n\u2018Affray\u2019 is an ancient common law offence.

It would therefore not be theft if a person borrowed the \nproperty but had no intention, at  the time of borrowing, to  deprive the owner of it. In this instance, there \nwould be the guilty act of keeping someone\u2019s property, but not the guilty/uni00A0mind.\nTwo examples of  how  the de\ufb01nition of a crime can broken down into speci\ufb01c elements are  provided \nbelow.

  "Page 94": "82 UNIT  1 GUIL T AND LIABILITYJoyriding (i.e. taking a \ncar without permission, \ndriving it around for a while and then returning or dumping it) became popular in the 1980s. The law was not equipped to  treat this \nas an offence because \u2018borrowing\u2019 a car in this way, without intending \nto permanently deprive \nthe owner of it, did not contain all the elements necessary to  establish \nthe crime of \u2018theft of a motor vehicle\u2019. A/uni00A0change to  the law \nwas made. Section \n73(14) of the Crimes Act now states that to  \ntake or use a motor \nvehicle in any manner is conclusive proof that the person intended to  \npermanently deprive the owner/uni00A0of/uni00A0it.Did you know? Many defences raised by  accused persons are  made on the basis that there was  no guilty mind. For  \nexample, the law  states that a person is incapable of forming the intention to  commit a crime (mens rea) in \ncertain circumstances. If a person injures another during an epileptic seizure, or while mentally impaired, \nthen he or she would not be guilty of a crime because there is no mens rea. That  is, the person was  acting \ninvoluntarily or had little understanding of the nature of their actions.\nSometimes a person has a lawful excuse for  committing a crime. Consider the crime of causing injury \nintentionally or recklessly, set out in section 18 of the Crimes Act  (see above), which requires a person to  \nhave  \u2018no lawful excuse\u2019 when causing the injury. If a person deliberately hit and injured another in self-\ndefence, that person would not be guilty of the crime because the law  allows people to  take  reasonable \nsteps to  protect themselves and others.\nOther crimes are  strict liability crimes. These crimes are  explored further/uni00A0below.\nStrict liability\nCrimes described as strict liability crimes have  no mental element in their legal de\ufb01nition, so  it is not a \ndefence to  say \u2018I didn\u2019t mean to  do it\u2019 . It is therefore su\ufb03cient for  a person to  have  committed the act that \nis against the law  (the actus reus), and the prosecution does not need to  prove  there was  mens/uni00A0rea.\nFor some, not all, strict liability crimes, the accused may  argue, in his or her defence, that the crime \nwas committed due to  a reasonable and honest mistake of/uni00A0fact.\nMany strict liability crimes are  summary o\ufb00ences. Two  examples are  provided in the extracts below.\nRoad Safety  Act 1986/uni00A0(Vic)\n49B Offence to  consume intoxicating liquor while driving\n(1) A person must not consume intoxicating liquor while the person is  driving a  motor vehicle \nor is in charge of a motor vehicle.EXTRACT\nSummary Offences Act 1966/uni00A0(Vic)\n13 Persons found drunk\nAny person found drunk in a public place shall be guilty of an offence.EXTRACT\nMany legal terms have \nLatin names. \u2018Doli incapax\u2019 comes from the Latin word dolus (unlawful intention) and incapax (no capacity).Did you know?A person/uni00A0\u2026\n\u2022 without  lawful excuse  (may involve a mental element)\n\u2022  intentionally  or  recklessly  (mental element)\u2022   causes injury   to another person (by doing some action \u2013 physical element)\n04_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   82 17/10/2017   1:00 PM",

  "Page 96": "84 UNIT 1  GUILT AND LIABILITYThe burden of/uni00A0proof\nThe burden of proof (also known as the onus of proof) upholds the principle that a person is innocent \nuntil proved guilty. The burden of proof refers to the party that has the responsibility to prove the facts of \nthe case. In general, the burden of proof lies with the person or party who is bringing the case; therefore, in a criminal case, it lies with the prosecution. This means the prosecution must prove that their view of the facts is correct. \nOne of the justi\ufb01cations for this is that if the prosecution is accusing a person of having committed a \ncrime, then the responsibility should be on the prosecution to establish the facts. It is not up to the accused to prove his or her innocence. \nIn theory, an accused does not need to do or say anything in his or her defence, and a person\u2019s silence \nis not to be taken as an admission of guilt. The accused may still be found not guilty if the accused does not raise a defence, particularly if the prosecution\u2019s case is weak. In reality, however, an accused will do what he or she can to refute the charge and to counter the prosecution\u2019s evidence.\nReversing the/uni00A0burden of/uni00A0proof\nThere are exceptions to the general rule that the prosecution has the burden of proof. In some instances, the parliament decides to reverse the burden of proof. These statutory exceptions require the accused to prove one or more aspects of the case on the balance of probabilities. In reversing the burden of proof, \nthe parliament\u2019s aim is to make it easier for the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable/uni00A0doubt.\nThe standard of/uni00A0proof\nThe standard of proof refers to the strength of evidence needed to prove a legal case. In criminal law, the prosecution must prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. \nA reasonable doubt must be sensible and realistic, and not one that is imaginary or fanciful or an \nunrealistic possibility. It is not enough that the accused is probably guilty or very likely to be guilty. balance of \nprobabilities the standard of proof in civil disputes. This requires the plaintiff to establish that it is more probable (i.e. likely) than not that his or her side of the story is rightIn 2016, the High Court reviewed RP\u2019s case. The High Court summarised the concept of doli \nincapax as \u2018the view that a child aged under 14/uni00A0years is not sufficiently intellectually and morally \ndeveloped to appreciate the difference between right and wrong and thus lacks the capacity for mens/uni00A0rea\u2019.\nThe prosecution argued that RP\u2019s actions showed he knew that what he was doing was wrong. \nThey argued that RP stopped the sexual act when he heard an adult nearby, held his brother so he could not move or cry out and then warned him not to tell. The High Court also heard other evidence about RP\u2019s \u2018very low intelligence\u2019, poor educational pathways and dysfunctional upbringing. He was possibly a victim of molestation and had been exposed to violence.\nThe High Court allowed the appeal. In its judgment, the Court commented that the prosecution \nprovided little evidence, other than the circumstances of the offence, to disprove doli incapax. \nThere was no evidence of RP\u2019s moral development or that the boy understood his actions were wrong, despite his low intelligence. It was not enough to show that RP knew the behaviour was rude or naughty. The High Court said it could not be assumed that the boy understood that hurting his younger brother was a serious moral wrong. The appeal was allowed, and the boy was acquitted of the crimes.\n04_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   84 17/10/2017   1:00 PM",

They pleaded guilty to three drug offences in the Victorian Supreme Court. The two conspired to import the drugs, from Italy into Melbourne, with at least six other men. The estimated street value \nof the drugs was $122/uni00A0million. It was the largest amount of ecstasy seized in Australia.\nThe Court heard that Barbaro was the head of a criminal gang and \nZirilli was his \u2018right hand man\u2019.

Barbaro was sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 30/uni00A0years and Zirilli was sentenced to 26/uni00A0years in prison with a non-parole period of 18/uni00A0years.\nBoth Barbaro and Zirilli appealed the severity of their sentences in the \nVictorian Court of Appeal and then the High Court of Australia.

It is common for  police, lawyers \nand the courts to  classify crimes into two  categories:/uni00A0 indictable o\ufb00ences (serious crimes) and summary \no\ufb00ences (minor crimes). This is because the legal system processes these crimes di\ufb00erently, using di\ufb00erent legal procedures, personnel and courts to  hear each type of o\ufb00ence.\nSummary o\ufb00ences are  not as serious and have  less impact on society, while indictable o\ufb00ences are  \nmore serious and have  a greater or more immediate impact on victims and the community.

The criminal justice system uses di\ufb00erent procedures when it deals with summary o\ufb00ences (minor crimes) as opposed to indictable o\ufb00ences (serious crimes).\nSummary offences\nSummary o\ufb00ences are minor criminal o\ufb00ences generally heard in the Magistrates\u2019 Court. They are less serious types of crime, and include o\ufb00ences such as drink driving, disorderly conduct, and minor assaults. \nMany summary o\ufb00ences are contained in the Summary O\ufb00ences Act 1966 (Vic), but many others are listed \nin various Victorian statutes and regulations. Most crimes committed in Victoria are summary o\ufb00ences.\nTo hear a case summarily means to hear it without a jury; therefore, summary o\ufb00ences are determined \nby a magistrate. The court procedures used in summary o\ufb00ences are less complex than those used in indictable o\ufb00ences.THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN SUMMARY \nOFFENCES AND INDICTABLE OFFENCES\nSource 1 Begging is a summary offence. Source 2 Homicide offences are indictable offences.\nIn this Area of Study \nyou are expected to distinguish between indictable offences and summary offences using examples. \u2018Distinguish\u2019 means to identify differences between things. To do this, use words such as \u2018on the other hand\u2019, \u2018whereas\u2019 and \u2018this is different from\u2019 when you are drawing out differences between the two offences. Study tip\nIndictable offences\nIndictable o\ufb00ences are serious criminal o\ufb00ences generally heard by a judge (and a jury if the accused \npleads not guilty) in the County Court or the Supreme Court of Victoria. Examples of indictable o\ufb00ences include homicide o\ufb00ences (murder and manslaughter) and rape. As a general rule, an o\ufb00ence in the Crimes Act is an indictable o\ufb00ence unless the Act states it is a summary o\ufb00ence.\nIndictable offences heard summarily\nThe law allows some indictable o\ufb00ences to be heard and determined summarily. These are o\ufb00ences that are classed as indictable o\ufb00ences but are less serious in nature. These o\ufb00ences can be heard as if they are minor o\ufb00ences, which means they will be heard and determined in the Magistrates\u2019 Court by a magistrate, instead of in one of the higher courts by a judge and/or jury. One example is retail theft. \nAn indictable o\ufb00ence may not be heard summarily unless the court determines it is appropriate and \nthe accused agrees. Accused people usually choose to have the o\ufb00ence heard summarily because a summary hearing is often quicker and cheaper than a trial. It may also attract a lesser punishment because indictable o\ufb00ence \nheard and determined summarily  a serious offence which can be heard and determined as a summary offence if the court and the accused agree\n04_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   90 17/10/2017   1:00 PM",

She has been fined for offensive behaviour and offensive language in a public place, posting bills on walls to advertise her singing gig, begging in the city, being drunk in a public place, and setting off fireworks in a public place without permission.\nThese are all summary offences, and Freya has only ever been fined or ordered to do community \nservice work, because they are relatively minor offences. \nBengt\u2019s indictable offences heard summarily\nFreya\u2019s older brother, Bengt, is a petty criminal who has committed some serious offences. Bengt stole an old Mitsubishi Verada worth $8000 and was charged with theft of a motor vehicle. He also broke into a house and stole a television and other electronic equipment. He was charged with burglary and theft (under $100 000). As he was trying to escape from the police he broke a window and smashed down a gate. The charge was criminal damage (less than $100/uni00A0000). \nEach offence is considered to be an indictable offence that can be heard and determined \nsummarily, so Bengt was able to avoid going before a jury in the County Court. All the charges were dealt with summarily in the Magistrates\u2019 Court.EXAMPLEThe example below further explores the distinction between summary o\ufb00ences, indictable o\ufb00ences, \nand indictable o\ufb00ences heard summarily.\n04_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   91 17/10/2017   1:00 PM",

If \na person accused of an indictable o\ufb00ence pleads not guilty, the case will go to trial and a judge and jury will hear the matter in court. The jury will be the decider of facts. That is, the jury will have to decide \nwhether the accused is guilty of the crime based on the evidence. \nThis chapter covers four types of indictable o\ufb00ences: murder, culpable driving, rape  and theft.\nFor each indictable o\ufb00ence, you will consider:\n\u2022 the speci\ufb01c elements of the o\ufb00ence\n\u2022 possible defences\u2022 the role of statute and common law in developing the elements and the defences\u2022 trends and statistics\u2022 the possible impact of the o\ufb00ence on individuals and society.\nElements of indictable offences\nAll indictable o\ufb00ences consist of speci\ufb01c elements that make up the o\ufb00ence.

For this reason, the prosecution will charge the accused with crimes that best match the accused\u2019s behaviour and actions at the time of the o\ufb00ence.

  "Page 113": "101  CHAPTER  5 INDICTABLE OFFENCESPossible defences to indictable offences\nWhen a person is charged with a criminal o\ufb00ence, they can usually raise a defence. Many defences \nare known as \u2018general defences\u2019, meaning that they can be used as a defence for many di\ufb00erent crimes. An example of a general defence is self-defence. Other defences are speci\ufb01c to a particular crime. \nFor each indictable o\ufb00ence in this chapter, you will look at the possible defences that can be used \nby an accused to defend a crime. \nDevelopment of the law\nCriminal law \ufb01rst developed through common law. Although now most of the criminal law is found in statutes (Acts of Parliament), some common law de\ufb01nitions and principles still apply to the de\ufb01nitions of o\ufb00ences and relevant defences. \nFor each indictable o\ufb00ence in this chapter, you will look at the role of parliament and the courts \nin developing the elements and the defences associated with that o\ufb00ence. \nTrends and statistics\nDue to the importance of crime and its e\ufb00ects on individuals and the community, government agencies and other organisations record and analyse crime statistics .\nThe amount of crime occurring in a community (the number of individual o\ufb00ences of the same \ntype) is called the incidence of crime. The Victorian Crime Statistics Agency (CSA) gathers and reports on the incidents of crime in Victoria. It was established on 1 January 2015 as an independent statistics agency to improve Victoria\u2019s crime reporting. \nThese statistics are collected and may be compared with those in other states and countries so \nthe government can determine the amount of crime in our community, measure the e\ufb00ectiveness of law enforcement agencies and plan for the best use of resources so our society is as crime-free as possible. A new website launched in June 2017, Crime Statistics Australia , provides statistics and \ndata on crime in Australia. \nA high crime rate in a particular community has social, economic and political e\ufb00ects. For \nexample, people may not feel safe in their neighbourhood and begin to interact with others di\ufb00erently. Families and businesses may move away from the area. This makes the area less desirable so housing prices and employment opportunities decrease. The community may demand better law enforcement from government, leading to new laws or an increase in taxes and other associated costs.\nThis chapter will analyse crime statistics in relation to each indictable o\ufb00ence in two \njurisdictions. When looking at crime statistics, remember that statistics are not always accurate, and do not always truly re\ufb02ect the level of crime in a community. This is sometimes because crime is often not reported by victims or members of the community.\nCrime statistics may also not truly re\ufb02ect the level of crime for other reasons. For example, an \naudit of Queensland crime statistics by the Queensland Audit O\ufb03ce was released on 26 April 2017. The report suggested issues with under-reporting of crimes by police to keep them \u2018o\ufb00 the books\u2019. Some police had chased clearance targets instead of accuracy, and some o\ufb03cers manipulated \ufb01gures to give false perceptions about the state\u2019s crime rates. The skill that you need \nto demonstrate in this Area of Study is your ability to argue the criminal culpability of an accused. This means you should be able to analyse facts given to you in a scenario and argue whether the accused will be found guilty or not of the crime. Make sure you are familiar with all the elements and all of the defences applicable to that crime.Study tip\nCriminologists study the social effects of crime on society from various perspectives. In universities they are usually found in the Sociology department, not the Law faculty. Outside universities they generally work for law enforcement agencies. They study normal and abnormal behaviour and develop theories about the best way to reduce crime.Did you know?prosecutor the Crown in its role of bringing a criminal case to court (also called \u2018the prosecution\u2019)\ncrime statistics \ninformation (i.e. data) collected by authorities such as the police and analysed to track the level of crime or offending in the community.

It is the \nunlawful killing of another person with malice \naforethought , by a person who is of the age of \ndiscretion (i.e. 10 years old and over) and of sound mind. \nMurder is the most serious of a group of homicide \no\ufb00ences. On the scale of seriousness, murder is a \u2018category 1\u2019 o\ufb00ence which must be given a prison sentence. The maximum penalty for murder is life imprisonment.\nWhether a person is found guilty of committing \nmurder depends on the elements of the o\ufb00ence being proved.\nElements of murder\nFor a person to be found guilty of murder, the prosecution must prove each of the following six elements beyond reasonable doubt:\n\u2022 the killing was unlawful\u2022 the victim was a human being\n\u2022 the accused was a person over the age of discretion\n\u2022 the accused caused the victim\u2019s death\u2022 the accused was a person of sound mind\u2022 there was malice aforethought.\nElement 1 \u2013 The killing was unlawful\nThe prosecutor must \ufb01rst establish or prove that the accused did not have a lawful reason for causing the \nother person\u2019s death. Examples of lawful killings are:\n\u2022 the use of the death penalty in countries where capital punishment is legal (though this would not be \na lawful killing in Australia as the death penalty is no longer used as a sentence) \n\u2022 a soldier killing an enemy in battle\n\u2022 a person acting in self-defence or under duress, and a court considers that action reasonable.\nElement 2 \u2013 The victim was a human being\nThe victim must be a living person who has been born (i.e. not an unborn baby or an animal).\nElement 3 \u2013 The accused was a person over the age of \ndiscretion\nThe accused must be at least 10 years of age. The law presumes that people under the age of 10 are \nincapable of forming the intent to commit a crime (i.e. doli incapax).murder \nthe intentional unlawful killing of another person with malice aforethought, by a person who is of the age of discretion (i.e. 10 years old or more) and of sound mind.

  "Page 117": "105  CHAPTER  5 INDICTABLE OFFENCESElement 4 \u2013 The accused caused the victim\u2019s death\nThe accused\u2019s actions must have contributed signi\ufb01cantly and substantially to a person\u2019s death. This \nis known as causation. Causation means there must be a direct or unbroken causal link between the accused\u2019s actions and the death of the victim. It is usually left to the jury to decide whether the accused caused the victim\u2019s death.\nWhen considering whether the accused caused the victim\u2019s death it is useful to ask: \u2018Would the death \nhave occurred, when it did, without the accused\u2019s actions?\u2019 If the answer is no, then the accused caused the victim\u2019s death. For example, if the accused shoots the victim and the victim dies two days later as a result of the gunshot, then there is a direct, unbroken causal link between the accused\u2019s actions and the death of the victim. The victim would not have ordinarily died within two days if he or she had not been shot by the accused.\nIf something intervenes to break the causal link between the accused\u2019s actions and the death, then \nthe accused may not be guilty of murder. The following example demonstrates a break in the causal link.Tests or exam \nquestions may ask you to determine whether a crime has been committed. To maximise your chances of receiving full marks, check the accused\u2019s actions against each of the elements of the crime. For example, all the elements of murder must be proved for an accused to be found guilty of murder.  Study tip\nA break in the causal link\nJack and Richard had a disagreement and \nJack punched Richard. Jack left Richard unconscious under a tree. Minutes later, a bolt of lightning struck the tree. A tree branch fell and killed Richard. In this example, the lightning represents a broken link, which is then a break in the causal link.EXAMPLE\nSource 2 A lightning strike created a break \nin the causal link. As a result, there was no longer a connection between Jack punching Richard, and Richard\u2019s death.\nHowever, it is not necessary for the accused\u2019s actions to be the sole cause of death for it to be \nmurder, but the accused\u2019s actions must have contributed \u2018signi\ufb01cantly\u2019 to the death. \nElement 5 \u2013 The accused was a person of sound mind\nThe prosecution must establish that the accused was a person of sound mind. This is a person who knows \nright from wrong, and understands the nature of what they have done. The law presumes that a person of unsound mind cannot form the intention to commit a crime (mens rea) because they do not understand what they are doing or they do they know that what they are doing is wrong.  \nFor example, if the accused was in a psychotic state and stabbed another person, because at the time \nthey thought they were being attacked by a wild animal, then they were not \u2018of sound mind\u2019 at the time of doing the act.\nElement 6 \u2013 There was malice aforethought\nTo prove murder, the prosecution must prove there was malice aforethought (i.e. an intention to cause serious harm). The state of mind that a person can have (i.e. the intention to cause serious harm) can exist in di\ufb00erent forms, as outlined in Source 3.mens rea \na Latin term meaning \u2018a guilty mind\u2019; the mental element of a crime (i.e. an awareness of the fact that the conduct is criminal).

Perry, armed with a 20-centimetre knife and high on the drug \u2018ice\u2019, entered the store and attacked Mrs O\u2019Toole. Her husband, Mr O\u2019Toole, tried to stop the attack and was stabbed twice in the chest while lying on his back on the floor. He died as a result. Perry said he did not intend to kill when he entered the store.\nPerry had a long criminal history and was on parole at the time of the killing. He pleaded \nguilty to murder, intentionally causing injury and armed robbery. Perry also pleaded guilty to \ntwo other armed robbery charges. He was sentenced to 20 years for murder. His total sentence, for all offences, was 27 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 23 years.\nPerry appealed against the severity of the sentence. The \nDirector of Public Prosecutions also appealed, on the grounds that the sentence was too lenient. The Victorian Court of Appeal rejected both appeals.\nThe Court of Appeal said the offender\u2019s intention was \nrelevant, and \u2018it must be proved \u2013 or admitted \u2013 that the \u2018act of violence\u2019 which caused the death was conscious, voluntary and deliberate\u2019. It also said \u2018the offence of statutory murder covers the full range of conduct, from the case where the death is an accidental result of the act of violence to the case where the death is the intended result of the act\u2019.LEGAL \nCASE\nSource 4 Expressions of community grief at the \nloss of Dermott O\u2019Toole through placing flowers in a \npublic place.\nAs seen in Source 3 above, if a person unintentionally kills another person while committing a violent \ncrime, the killing can still constitute murder.

  "Page 119": "107  CHAPTER  5 INDICTABLE OFFENCESPossible defences to murder\nEach indictable o\ufb00ence consists of speci\ufb01c elements. Failure to prove all elements will result in the \naccused being found not guilty of the crime, and the accused may try to argue that one of the elements is missing. For example, the accused may argue that:\n\u2022 the killing was lawful\u2022 the accused was under the age of discretion \u2022 there was a break in causation and the accused did not cause the victim\u2019s death.\nIn some cases, the accused may be found guilty of an alternative o\ufb00ence should the elements for the \nalternative o\ufb00ence be proven. For example, murder may be reduced to manslaughter if the prosecution \ncan prove the unlawful killing, but not the mens rea (the intention).\nOther than defending the charge for murder on the basis that one or more of the elements has not \nbeen satis\ufb01ed, the accused can rely on a particular defence. Several defences to a charge of murder are available. These defences generally show that the accused did not or could not form the intention (guilty mind) to commit the o\ufb00ence.\nThere are \ufb01ve possible defences to a charge of murder. These are:\n\u2022 self-defence\n\u2022 mental impairment\u2022 duress\u2022 sudden or extraordinary emergency\u2022 involuntary actions.\nDefence 1 \u2013 Self-defence\nA person is not guilty of murder if:\u2022 they believed that their actions were necessary in self-defence \u2022 their actions were reasonable in the circumstances as the person perceived \nthem.\nIn murder cases, the accused must believe their actions were necessary to \nprotect themselves or another person from death or really serious injury.\u2192 GOING FURTHER\nMurder is not the only homicide offence. If all the elements of the murder offence are not present, \nthe accused may still be charged with, and found guilty of, other offences. Some additional homicide offences include:\n\u2022 attempted murder \u2013 Trying to murder someone or a failed attempt at murder\n\u2022 conspiracy to murder \u2013 Planning with at least one other person to murder someone \n\u2022 incitement to murder \u2013  Encouraging or authorising someone to commit a murder\n\u2022 manslaughter \u2013 The unintentional killing of a person due to a reckless, dangerous act or \nnegligent behaviour \n\u2022 infanticide \u2013 The killing by a mother of a child under 2 years old while suffering a mental condition caused by the effects of that child\u2019s birth\n\u2022 child homicide \u2013 The killing of a child under 6 years of age in circumstances that would normally be manslaughter.\nInformation on these additional homicide offences are provided in your obook assess.A Victorian man kept \nhis dead wife\u2019s body in a drum in his backyard for 23 years.

  "Page 120": "108 UNIT 1  GUILT AND LIABILITYDefence 2 \u2013 Mental impairment\nAnother defence that can be raised by an accused is the mental impairment defence. A person is not \nguilty of murder if, at the time of the o\ufb00ence, they were su\ufb00ering from a mental illness (or disease of the mind) and, as a result, they:\n\u2022 did not know what they were doing because they had little understanding of the nature and quality of \ntheir actions \n\u2022 did not know their conduct was wrong or could not reason, or think about, their conduct like an ordinary person.\nA successful defence of mental impairment does not immediately result in the accused being released \nfrom custody. That is, the verdict is not an ordinary \u2018not guilty\u2019 verdict. Instead, it is a special verdict of \u2018not \nguilty by reason of mental impairment\u2019 . \nIn these cases, the court will generally impose a custodial supervision order (i.e. an order that involves \nsome form of detention or supervision \u2013 often in a medical facility). This order has a nominal term of 25 years, and con\ufb01nes the person to a psychiatric facility so appropriate care and treatment can be provided. The court will periodically review the order.\nAn example of a legal case where a person was found not guilty due to mental impairment is \nprovided below. mental impairment \na condition of the mind which impacts on a person\u2019s ability to know the nature and quality of his or her conduct, or that the conduct was wrong\nUndiagnosed psychosis results in a killing\nDPP v Woodhead [2016] VSC 472 (26 April 2016)\nEaston Woodhead, a man who believed he was the son of a werewolf, was charged with the \nmurder of a homeless man. He was found not guilty due to mental impairment. Woodhead \nbelieved the homeless man was responsible for the theft of his motorcycle. In the early hours of the morning on 5 January 2014, Woodhead stabbed the homeless man, known as \u2018Mouse\u2019, several times with a large knife when he refused to help Woodhead retrieve his motorcycle. Mouse died soon after the attack.\nExtensive psychiatric evidence was given at the trial. It showed Woodhead\u2019s \nactions were due to an undiagnosed psychosis. A witness for the prosecution gave evidence that Woodhead was probably a paranoid schizophrenic and that he knew, at the time of the offence, that what he was doing was wrong.\nSince the killing, Woodhead has received treatment and has shown remorse for \nhis actions. He has been detained under a custodial supervision order. The order \nwill be reviewed periodically.\nSource/uni00A06 Easton Woodhead \nleaves court under security escortLEGAL \nCASE\nDefence 3 \u2013 Duress\nA person is not guilty of murder if they act under duress. The defence of duress applies if, at the time of the o\ufb00ence:\n\u2022 the person has a re asonable belief that:\n\u2022 a threat of harm exists\u2022 the threat would be carried out unless the o\ufb00ence was committed\u2022 committing an o\ufb00ence is the only reasonable way to avoid the threatened harm\n\u2022 the person\u2019s conduct is a reasonable response to the threat.reasonable belief \nan honestly held opinion about the way things are, which would seem to another ordinary person with similar characteristics (e.g. age or maturity), in similar circumstances, to be sensible or correct\nduress \nstrong mental pressure on someone to overcome their independent will and force them to do something\n05_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   108 17/10/2017   1:23 PM",

Evidence of family \nviolence may be used to prove a person acted under duress.\nThere is no duress if the threat comes from a person with whom the accused voluntarily \nassociates to commit an act of violence. \nDefence 4 \u2013 Sudden or extraordinary emergency\nA person is not guilty of murder if they act as a result of a sudden or extraordinary emergency.  \nThe person must reasonably believe that:\n\u2022 there is a sudden or extraordinary emergency\u2022 their actions are the only reasonable way of dealing with the situation\u2022 their actions are a reasonable response to the situation.\nIn murder cases, the sudden or extraordinary emergency must involve risk of death or \nserious injury.\nDefence 5 \u2013 Involuntary actions\nA person is not guilty of murder if their actions were involuntary. The involuntary nature of the accused\u2019s \nactions may mean that one or more elements of the crime cannot be met. While not technically a defence, the involuntary nature of the accused\u2019s actions may mean that a guilty mind (mens rea) cannot be proved. This may see the accused acquitted of the o\ufb00ence, and charged or found guilty of a lesser o\ufb00ence.\nFor a murder charge, the accused may state that their actions were involuntary due to:\n\u2022 intoxication\n\u2022 automatism \n\u2022 accident. \nIntoxication\nThe defence of intoxication exists at both common law (i.e. a common law defence) and statute law (i.e. \na statutory defence). A person may be intoxicated by reason of consumption of alcohol, taking drugs, or some other substance. \nUnder common law, gross intoxication is a way of proving that the accused acted involuntarily or \nwithout intent. If the accused is so drunk or a\ufb00ected by drugs that he or she cannot form the intention to commit the crime, then the person may be found not guilty. This defence is rarely successful because the level of intoxication required to make a person\u2019s actions involuntary is extreme.\nIn addition, the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) speci\ufb01es the way a court is to deal with intoxication when it is \nraised in cases involving self-defence, duress and sudden or extraordinary emergency. These defences often require the court to assess whether a person\u2019s belief or response was \u2018reasonable\u2019 . In determining reasonableness, the court must use two tests based on whether the accused\u2019s intoxication was:\n\u2022 self-induced intoxication \u2013 Intoxication is considered to be self-induced unless it is involuntary or \ndue to fraud, sudden or extraordinary emergency, accident, reasonable mistake, duress, force, or the \ne\ufb00ects of proper use of prescription or non-prescription medication. In this situation, the court must compare the accused\u2019s belief or actions to those of a reasonable person who is not intoxicated\n\u2022 not self-induced intoxication \u2013 The court must compare the accused\u2019s belief or actions to those of a reasonable person intoxicated to the same level as the accused.\nThe legal case on the next page  highlights an example of murder as a result of self-induced intoxication. automatism \na state in which a person has a total loss of control over their bodily movements (i.e. is not conscious or aware of what they are doing), so that they cannot form an intention to commit a crime\nself-induced intoxication the act of getting drunk of your own free will.

He admitted to  \ndrinking approximately 15  bottles of  beer. When his partner and a  female relative tried to  wake  \nhim, he woke  in a  rage and hit out at both women. His partner fell to  the ground. Cook then \npicked up the chair and hit her with such force  that the chair leg  penetrated her skull. Cook \nwas intoxicated at  the time, to  the point that he  could not walk properly. He was  remorseful and \ncooperative during police questioning.\nThe Supreme Court heard that the couple\u2019s relationship was, at times, violent. Cook\u2019s \nviolence was  attributed to  his disadvantaged background, alcohol dependence and borderline \npersonality disorder. \nA Supreme Court jury found Cook guilty of murder. He was  sentenced to  21 years and 6  \nmonths in prison with a non-parole period of 17 years and 6 months.LEGAL  \nCASE\nAutomatism\nAutomatism can be relied on where a person has a total loss of control over  their bodily movements. \nBecause they have  completely lost control, it is accepted that they cannot form  the intention to  commit a \ncrime, since they are  not conscious or aware  of what they are  doing. Therefore, the action is considered \nto be involuntary. \nIt is not enough to  say \u2018I didn\u2019t know what I was  doing\u2019 . Some external factor had to  be the sole cause \nof the actions. A person may  be found not guilty of an o\ufb00ence if they committed the crime:\n\u2022 while sleeping or sleepwalking\n\u2022 while su\ufb00ering concussion\u2022 during an epileptic seizure\u2022 as a result of a medical condition or because of a side e\ufb00ect of the proper use of medication.\nAutomatism does not mean the person has a mental illness. Rather, the person is in a zombie-like \nstate  and \u2018out of it\u2019 mentally, but capable of physical acts. For  this reason it is sometimes called \u2018sane \nautomatism\u2019 to  distinguish it from \u2018insane automatism\u2019 , which is also involuntary, but results from a mental \nillness. Automatism is a defence that is extremely rare  and di\ufb03cult to  prove.  The leading Australian case \non the defence is R v Falconer (1990) 171 CLR 30.\nSource 8  \nSleepwalking is one condition during which a person might commit an involuntary act.

Just before \nshe killed him, he  had sexually assaulted her and she had become aware of  facts which made \nher suspect him of sexually abusing her foster daughter. During the hearing, Mrs  Falconer \nclaimed that there was  a complete blank in  her memory until she woke  up with a  gun and her \ndeceased husband next to  her.\nAfter being convicted, Mrs  Falconer appealed on a  point of law. The High Court held that if \nthere was  evidence of an  external psychological factor (i.e. severe  trauma and abuse) she could \nhave acted in a  dissociative state.  This meant that although she was  sane (i.e. not mentally ill), it  \nwas possible that her actions were  not under her conscious control.

The de\ufb01nition of murder is still contained in common law, with Section 3 of the Crimes Act specifying the penalty for the crime. That is, all of the elements of murder are not set out in the Crimes Act, but have been established throughout the years by the courts. \nThe courts had also developed what is known as the \u2018felony murder rule\u2019 . This rule was that a person \nwho unintentionally caused the death of another by an act of violence could be convicted of murder \nas if that person had the intention to kill. Section 3A was inserted into the Crimes Act, which abrogates (cancels) the felony murder rule. \nVarious common law defences can still be raised to defend a murder charge. These include the \ndefences of intoxication, accident and automatism. \nStatute law\nAlthough the elements of murder are contained in common law, various additions or changes have been made to the crime, as well as the defences that are available in murder cases. For example, there is now a statutory intoxication defence, set out in Section 322T of the Crimes Act. \nThe Victorian Parliament has also had a signi\ufb01cant role in changing the law in relation to killings \ninvolving family violence and abolishing certain defences. A summary is provided below.\nThe abolition of provocation and defensive homicide\nBefore the defence of provocation was abolished, a person charged with murder could be found guilty of \nmanslaughter instead. In 2005, following the Victorian Law Reform Commission\u2019s extensive review of homicide laws, the Victorian Parliament abolished (i.e. removed) the partial defence of provocation.  This legal change meant that people who killed their domestic partner out of jealousy, rage or a sudden loss of control could no longer argue that the victim provoked them in some way.\nWomen\u2019s groups and the families of people killed as a result of family violence welcomed the change. \nThey felt the law was out of date, harked back to days when women had few rights and blamed the victim rather than the o\ufb00ender.\nAt the same time, the Victorian Parliament created the o\ufb00ence of defensive homicide for people \nwho killed an abusive partner or family member after su\ufb00ering ongoing family violence. This o\ufb00ence applied in cases where a person genuinely believed that the killing of another person was necessary to defend themselves or someone else, but their belief was unreasonable in the circumstances (e.g. it abrogate  \nto cancel or abolish \na court-made law by passing an Act of Parliament\nprovocation \na defence alleging loss of control as a response to the sufficient provocative conduct of another person\nVictorian Law Reform \nCommission (VLRC) Victoria\u2019s leading independent law reform organisation.

These o\ufb00enders would be not guilty of murder, but guilty of defensive homicide.\nThe new o\ufb00ence of defensive homicide was initially welcomed, \nbut was soon criticised. It was supposed to help women who killed their violent partners, but research revealed it was not achieving its purpose. A Victorian Department of Justice discussion paper noted that between 2005 and 2010 there were 13 defensive homicide cases in Victoria. Many were the result of a single violent incident between males, with a minority of cases involving women or family relationships. \nIn 2014, the o\ufb00ence of defensive homicide was abolished. To \nprovide a suitable defence for persons who kill following prolonged family violence, the law of self-defence was changed. The law now states that a person is not guilty of murder if the person believes their conduct is necessary in self-defence and their behaviour is reasonable in the circumstances as they perceive them.\nTrends and statistics\nWhile Australia\u2019s homicide rates \ufb02uctuate from year to year, there is generally no signi\ufb01cant increase. As shown in Source 2, homicide rates are relatively stable and decreasing in some states and territories over time. \nSource 1 Women\u2019s groups and the families of people killed \nby family violence welcomed the abolition (removal) of the \npartial defence of provocation in 2005.\nSTATE HOMICIDE RATES IN AUSTRALIA (2012/endash.case2016)\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\nNew South Wales 1.5 1.8 1.5 1.3 1.3\nVictoria 1.6 1.4 1.8 1.7 1.9\nQueensland 2.3 2.0 2.4 2.2 2.4\nSouth Australia 3.0 2.4 2.0 2.1 2.2\nWestern Australia 2.2 1.8 1.4 1.9 2.4\nTasmania 2.5 - 1.7 1.2 2.5\nNorthern Territory 9.8 9.9 4.9 6.5 2.0\nAustralian Capital Territory 1.6 - 0.8 1.5 1.02012 2013 2014 2015 2016\nNew South Wales 1.5 1.8 1.5 1.3 1.3\nVictoria 1.6 1.4 1.8 1.7 1.9\nQueensland 2.3 2.0 2.4 2.2 2.4\nSouth Australia 3.0 2.4 2.0 2.1 2.2\nWestern Australia 2.2 1.8 1.4 1.9 2.4\nTasmania 2.5 - 1.7 1.2 2.5\nNorthern Territory 9.8 9.9 4.9 6.5 2.0\nAustralian Capital \nTerritory 1.6 - 0.8 1.5 1.0\nSource: Australian Bureau of Statistics, Recorded Crime \u2013 Victims Australia, 2016\nSource 2 While Australia\u2019s homicide rates fluctuate from year to year, there is generally no significant increase in murders. \nVictoria\nIn Victoria, the statistics show that the homicide rate has generally \ufb02uctuated, without any real trend of \nincreasing or decreasing.

This statistic has been criticised, given Indigenous people make up only 3.8 per cent of the population \n\u2022 all adult o\ufb00enders received life in prison.\nPossible impacts of murder\nThe most obvious impact of murder is the loss of the victim\u2019s life. However, murder also has a devastating and lasting impact on the victim\u2019s family and friends. It results in grief, anger and emotional trauma. This trauma may be exacerbated (made worse) when family members witness the attack, discover the body or \ufb01nd out the attack was excessively brutal. This trauma may be long-lasting, particularly if the police cannot \ufb01nd the o\ufb00ender or if it takes the legal system several years to bring the o\ufb00ender to court. Family members may feel stress long after the legal system has dealt with the case. Signi\ufb01cant dates like the anniversary of the death or the victim\u2019s birthday can remind family members of their loss.\nFamily members often feel they have few rights when dealing with the legal system or the media. They \nare not the immediate victim and are entitled to only limited information about police investigations. They often feel \u2018invisible\u2019 in the criminal justice system. They may want to know exactly how their family member died, but that information may be withheld for legal reasons. They may also be subject to media scrutiny, making their private lives public. Constant media reports, published images of the victim and speculation about the family member\u2019s death can cause family members distress. \nBayley v The Queen [2013] VSCA 295 (21 October 2013) is a murder case that shocked the community \nand attracted signi\ufb01cant media coverage.Sentencing Advisory \nCouncil  an independent statutory body that provides statistics on sentencing in Victoria, conducts research, seeks public opinion and advises the Victorian Government on sentencing matters\n05_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   114 17/10/2017   1:23 PM",

He  appealed, saying the sentence \nwas too harsh. \nThe appeal judges found that the gravity of the \nkilling warranted a life sentence. They said:\nThe non-parole period fixed by His Honour was  entirely within range in the circumstances \nof this offending. We  observe that the learned judge made limited moderation for  the early \nplea and some remorse. However,  those matters needed to  be put in context. Initially the \napplicant in the record  of interview denied involvement. It was  only when confronted by \nthe evidence against him that he admitted guilt and assisted the police.

He then turned and walked away.  \nHe did not assist the victim or  stop to  see if  he was  hurt. Later, he  showed some remorse. He  had \nfew prior convictions and good prospects of rehabilitation.\nThe jury found Zandipour guilty.

Reckless  drivers (i.e. drivers who take \nhigh risks while driving) endanger the health and lives of other drivers, passengers and pedestrians. A driver who kills someone as a result of extreme carelessness or recklessness while driving may be charged with culpable driving causing death (commonly referred to as culpable driving ).\nCulpable driving carries a maximum \npenalty of 20 years in prison and/or a \ufb01ne of 2400 penalty units. Whether a person is found guilty of committing culpable driving depends on the elements of the o\ufb00ence being proved. \nElements of culpable driving \nFor a person to be found guilty of culpable driving, the prosecution must prove the following two elements beyond reasonable doubt:\n\u2022 the accused  was the driver of a motor vehicle\n\u2022 the accused culpably caused a person\u2019s death while driving the motor vehicle.\nElement 1 \u2013 The accused was the driver of a motor \nvehicle\nThis means that the accused must have substantial control over the movement of a motor vehicle. \nMotor vehicles are generally motorised vehicles intended to be driven on a highway (namely cars, trucks, buses or motorbikes).\nVehicles that are not motor vehicles include those intended to be used on a railway or tramway, and \nmotorised wheelchairs which cannot go at a speed of more than 10 kilometres per hour and which are used to carry an injured or disabled person.\nElement 2 \u2013 The accused culpably caused a person\u2019s \ndeath while driving the motor vehicle\n\u2018Culpability\u2019 is a responsibility for a fault or wrong.

The \ntruck drove  into the path of a  family\u2019s car,  which had right of \nway at an  intersection. The truck rolled on its  side and dragged \nthe car  35 metres. There was  no evidence that the driver was  \naffected by alcohol, drugs or fatigue.\nThe driver, Jobandeep Gill, blamed his truck\u2019s faulty gears \nfor his failure to  obey a  stop  sign at the intersection. An eye  \nwitness said that the truck did not slow  down prior to  driving \nthrough the intersection and a  mechanical analysis did not find \na fault with the truck\u2019s gears.\nA jury found Gill guilty of four counts of culpable driving \ncausing death. He was  sentenced to 10  years in  prison and must \nserve a  non-parole period of 6  years and 3  months. Gill\u2019s appeal \nagainst his conviction was dismissed.LEGAL  \nCASE\nSource 4 The scene of the crash near the town of \nCatani in February 2014, which left four members of the same family deadThe following legal case further highlights the e\ufb00ect of negligent driving on an entire family and their \ncommunity. The  incident left four people dead and one child without a family.\nUsing a mobile phone while driving is enough to justify charging a \ndriver with culpable driving if they cause a collision and someone dies as a result.Did you know?\nEXAMPLE The accused was not driving the vehicle\nA car  carrying two  men crashed at  high speed and flipped over.  Both men were  ejected from the car.  \nOne man suffered a  brain injury, and the other died in the crash. The surviving man was  charged \nwith culpable driving as a  result of the incident. He said he could not remember who was  driving \nat the time.\nAn expert called in the case said that there was  a 75 per cent chance that the accused was  \nejected from the driver\u2019s side of the car,  making him the driver. However,  a text  message sent to  \na friend just before the collision indicated that the man was not driving at the time of the crash.\n05_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   120 17/10/2017   1:23 PM",
  "Page 133": "121  CHAPTER  5 INDICTABLE OFFENCESIn some cases, the accused may  be found guilty of an alternative o\ufb00ence should the elements for  the \nalternative o\ufb00ence be proven. \nIn the following legal case,  a collision between a truck and a train resulted in the death of  11 people. \nThe truck driver successfully defended a culpable driving charge, arguing that he was  not negligent and \nthat the accident was  due to  poor road conditions at  the time.\nNot driving culpably in the circumstances\nChristiaan Scholl, Supreme Court of Victoria (unreported, 2009)\nOn 6  June 2007, Christiaan Scholl drove  his truck onto a  level  crossing north of Kerang in \nnorthern Victoria. His truck collided with a  V/Line passenger train bound for  Melbourne. Eleven  \npeople were  killed in the accident. The prosecution alleged \nthat the truck driver did not take  proper care  when entering \nthe intersection.\nThe driver gave evidence in his defence and said he could \nnot explain why  he did not see the flashing warning lights \nuntil it was too  late. Experts were  able to  establish that the \nintersection was  sufficiently flawed and presented difficulties \nto the driver. Two  other truck drivers gave evidence to  say they \nfound it difficult to  see the flashing red lights at the crossing.\nIn addition to  the 11 people who died, 23 were  injured and \nthree were  unaccounted for.  The driver was  found not guilty of \n11 charges of  culpable driving causing death and eight charges \nof negligently causing serious injury.\nMedia reports suggested that families of the victims were  \nleft unsatisfied because blame had not been attributed to  \nanyone for the crash.LEGAL  \nCASE\nOther than defending the charge for  culpable driving on the basis that one or more of the elements has \nnot been satis\ufb01ed, the accused can rely  on a particular defence. These defences generally show that the \naccused did not or could not form  the intention (guilty mind) to  commit the o\ufb00ence.\nThere are  three main possible defences for  culpable driving. These are:\n\u2022 duress \n\u2022 sudden and extraordinary emergency\u2022 involuntary actions (i.e. automation).\nDefence 1 \u2013 Duress\nA person is not guilty of culpable driving if they act under duress. The  defence of duress applies if,  at the \ntime of the o\ufb00ence:\u2022 the person has a reasonable belief that:\n\u2022 a threat of harm exists\u2022 the threat would be carried out unless the o\ufb00ence was  committed\n\u2022 committing an o\ufb00ence is the only reasonable way  to avoid the threatened harm\n\u2022 the person\u2019s conduct is a reasonable response to  the threat.\nThere is no duress if the threat comes from a person with whom the accused voluntarily associates to  \ncommit an act of violence. duress \nstrong mental pressure on someone to overcome their \nindependent will and force  them to  do \nsomething\nreasonable belief \nan honestly held opinion about the way  things \nare, which would seem to another ordinary \nperson with similar characteristics (e.g. age or maturity), in similar circumstances, to  be \nsensible or correct\nSource 5 Police rescue workers remove victims from the wreckage of a passenger train which collided with a semi-trailer at a level  crossing, six kilometres \nnorth of the country town of Kerang in north-western Victoria.\n05_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   121 17/10/2017   1:23 PM",
  "Page 134": "122 UNIT 1  GUILT AND LIABILITYThe following example explores how the defence of duress can be used to defend a charge of \nculpable driving. \nDefence 2 \u2013 Sudden and extraordinary emergency\nA person is not guilty of culpable driving if, in extraordinary circumstances, they act as a result of a \nsudden or extraordinary emergency.\nThe person must reasonably believe that:\n\u2022 there is a sudden or extraordinary emergency\n\u2022 their actions are the only reasonable way of dealing with the situation\u2022 their actions are a reasonable response to the situation.\nThe following hypothetical scenario provides an example of a type of emergency that may occur \nwhen driving.Whether someone has \ncommitted culpable driving causing death will be determined by checking the offender\u2019s actions against each element of the offence and then considering any defences applicable to the circumstances of the case.Study tipDuress as a defence in culpable driving causing death\nA bank robber, holding a gun, jumps into a car halted at traffic lights. The robber shouts \u2018Get me \nout of here, or I\u2019ll shoot!\u2019 The driver is terrified and fears being shot. He speeds off and kills a pedestrian crossing the green light.  The driver could raise duress as a defence.\nSudden and extraordinary \nemergency as a defence in culpable driving causing death\nIn seeing a runaway car rolling down a hill, a man \nopens the car door, jumps into the driver\u2019s seat and tries to steer it away from a crowded street. In the process he hits a large cardboard box. A homeless person is sleeping inside the box.EXAMPLE\nEXAMPLE\nSource 6 A runaway car rolling down a hill \ncreates a sudden and extraordinary emergency.\nDefence 3 \u2013 Involuntary actions \nA person is not guilty of culpable driving if their actions were involuntary. The involuntary nature of the \naccused\u2019s actions may mean that one or more elements of the crime cannot be met. While not technically a defence, the involuntary nature of the accused\u2019s actions may mean that a guilty mind (mens rea) cannot be proved. This may see the accused acquitted of the o\ufb00ence charged or found guilty of a lesser o\ufb00ence.\nFor a culpable driving charge, the accused may state that their actions were involuntary due to \nautomatism. \nAutomatism \nAutomatism can be relied on where a person has a total loss of control over their bodily movements. Because they have completely lost control, it is accepted that they cannot form the intention to commit a crime, since they are not conscious or aware of what they are doing. Therefore, the action is considered to be involuntary. automatism \na state in which a person has a total loss of control over their bodily movements (i.e. is not conscious or aware of what they are doing), so that they cannot form an intention to commit a crime\n05_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   122 17/10/2017   1:23 PM",

  "Page 136": "124 UNIT 1  GUILT AND LIABILITY5.5 CULPABLE DRIVING \u2013 DEVELOPMENT OF \nTHE LAW, TRENDS & IMPACTS \nIn this topic you will explore, in relation to culpable driving:\n\u2022 the role of common law and statute law in developing the elements and defences\u2022 trends and statistics in Victoria and another jurisdiction\u2022 the possible impacts of the crime on individuals and society. \nThe role of the law in developing the elements and \ndefences\nCommon law \nUnlike other o\ufb00ences related to unlawful killing, the elements of the o\ufb00ence do not have a history of long, \nslow development through the common law. Motor cars were \ufb01rst built in Australia around the 1890s. Because they are comparatively new, the law in relation to their use is also new. South Australia was the \ufb01rst state to regulate car use (in 1904) and other states followed soon after. Therefore, in relation to the elements, the role of courts is largely to interpret the legislation and apply it to the facts of the case.\nAutomatism, a defence that can be raised to defend a culpable driving claim, is a common law defence, \nand therefore the common law principles still apply. \nStatute law \nCulpable driving is a statutory o\ufb00ence under the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic). Culpable driving laws were initially \nde\ufb01ned in statute and have been re\ufb01ned through statutory interpretation as courts hear cases. The o\ufb00ence was developed in direct response to high road tolls and community concerns about irresponsible drivers who put other people\u2019s lives at risk.\nReform of the law on culpable driving causing death has been limited to altering the maximum penalty \nfor the o\ufb00ence to re\ufb02ect changes in community attitudes. The penalty for this o\ufb00ence has increased in the last two decades from a maximum of 10 years in prison to 20 years in prison.\nThis shows a signi\ufb01cant change in people\u2019s attitudes. In the past, people were more sympathetic to \nthose who killed while driving a motor vehicle. The community has slowly come to realise that driving causing death is a form of involuntary manslaughter and deserving of a similar penalty. The unnecessary carnage on our roads has led to the community wanting drivers whose actions are grossly negligent to be punished appropriately. \nTrends and statistics\nVictoria\nIn Victoria, the Crime Statistics Agency (CSA) has recorded that between April 2016 and March 2017, there were 76 driving causing death o\ufb00ences. However, this number includes all driving o\ufb00ences which result in death, and not just culpable driving. This is an 8.4 per cent decrease in the previous year\u2019s number, being 83. Over the past \ufb01ve years, there has been no trend of increase or decrease in the number of culpable driving o\ufb00ences. \nIn Victoria, Sentencing Advisory Council statistics show an increase in imprisonment rates for the \no\ufb00ence over time. Over 85 per cent of o\ufb00enders sentenced for culpable driving causing death receive an The Locomotive Acts \n(UK) regulated the use of all mechanically propelled vehicles on public roads at the end of the nineteenth century. The maximum speed was 4/uni00A0miles per hour (6.4/uni00A0km/h) in the country and 2/uni00A0miles per hour (3.2/uni00A0km/h) in the city. A man carrying a red flag was required to walk in front of a vehicle towing a trailer.Did you know?The Sentencing Advisory Council is a Victorian independent statutory body that aims to inform, educate and advise on sentencing issues.

This di\ufb00erence may  be due to  these states having di\ufb00erent \ngeographies, road systems, population distributions and driving distances. \nHowever, it is more likely to  be due to  the type of  data  collated. The  Queensland \ndata shows all reported incidents whereas the Victorian data  only shows the \nnumber of people found guilty and sentenced for  the o\ufb00ence.\nThe number of culpable driving deaths in Victoria and Queensland is \nrelatively low,  considering that these states have  populations of more than 5 \nmillion and 4 million respectively. Data  shows that since 2012, the number \nof culpable driving convictions in Victoria and the number of reported \ncases in Queensland have  decreased. This may  be due to  advances in road \nengineering and improved safety features in cars.\nPossible impacts of culpable driving\nHigh-risk behaviour including excessive speed, fatigue, use of a mobile phone and use of alcohol and drugs while driving can result in fatal  motor vehicle \ncollisions.

It is a form of violence and is punishable \nby a maximum of 25 years in prison. The legal de\ufb01nitions of rape and other sexual o\ufb00ences are set out in the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic). \nMany victims of rape wrongly blame \nthemselves rather than the o\ufb00ender. Some do not tell their families and many do not report the crime to the police. Rape is therefore under reported as a crime. Victims also do not report because they fear the criminal justice system and its ability to achieve a just outcome in their case.\nWhether a person is found guilty of committing \nrape depends on the elements of the o\ufb00ence being proven.\nElements of rape \nTo be found guilty of rape, the prosecution must prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that at the time of the o\ufb00ence there was:\n\u2022 sexual penetration \u2013 the accused intentionally sexually penetrated another person\u2022 lack of consent \u2013 the other person did not consent to this sexual penetration\u2022 lac k of reasonable belief \u2013 the accused did not reasonably believe that the other person consented to \nthe penetration.Both sexual penetration and consent are de\ufb01ned in the Crimes Act. They are the key aspects of rape \no\ufb00ences. If more than one act of rape is committed, each will be charged as a separate o\ufb00ence.\nElement 1 \u2013 Sexual penetration\nFor a person to be found guilty of rape, the prosecution must prove that the accused sexually penetrated \nthe victim either with the accused\u2019s penis, another body part (e.g. a \ufb01nger) or an object. Sexual penetration occurs when the accused does any of the following acts:\n\u2022 intr oducing (to any extent) a part of their body or an object into the victim\u2019s vagina (which is de\ufb01ned \nto include external genitalia or a surgically constructed vagina)\n\u2022 introducing (to any extent) a part of their body or an object into the victim\u2019s anus\u2022 introducing (to any extent) their penis into the victim\u2019s mouth\u2022 ha ving done any of those things, continues to keep a part of their body, an object or their penis, there \n(in the vagina, anus or mouth)A person does not commit rape if the sexual penetration is done in good faith and for medical or \nhygienic purposes.\nRape can also consist of forcing a victim to sexually penetrate themselves by forcing them to put an \nobject or a part of their body into their own vagina or anus.\nSections 35A(3),(4) and (5) of the Crimes Act contain similar provisions that apply to sexually penetrating \nanimals or being sexually penetrated by animals.rape  \nthe act of sexually \npenetrating another person without consent \nSource 1 Rape is defined as sexual penetration \nwithout consent.

The following \nlegal case illustrates how the element of lack of consent can be present in a case involving an intoxicated \nvictim.  The Crimes Act states \nthat \u2018a person who intends and attempts to commit any serious crime (like rape) is guilty of the indictable offence of attempting to commit that offence\u2019. This means that, like attempted murder, a person can be found guilty of attempted rape.Did you know?\nTaking advantage of a young girl\u2019s intoxication\nJurj & Miftode v The Queen; DPP v Jurj & Miftode [2016] VSCA 57 \n(4 April 2016)\nIn the early hours of 5 April 2009, Ross Jurj and Daniel Miftode, both in their early twenties, \noffered a lift to a drunk 14-year-old girl who was sitting at a railway station in the south-east of \nMelbourne at around midnight. The girl said she did not want to go home intoxicated. The pair drove to a shop to buy her a soft drink before taking her to a factory where one of them worked. \nThe County Court of Victoria heard that the men took \nadvantage of the girl\u2019s intoxicated state. The pair took turns to repeatedly rape her. They repeatedly ignored her crying and pleas to be left alone. The next morning, the girl was dropped off at a shopping centre close to where they had found her.\nAt the trial, Jurj admitted to engaging in one act of \noral penetration but said he thought the girl was over 16 years of age. Miftode testified that he witnessed this sexual act. Both denied all other allegations.LEGAL \nCASE\nSource 2 Rape of a child under 16 is a serious offence.

  "Page 141": "129  CHAPTER  5 INDICTABLE OFFENCESElement 3 \u2013 Lack of reasonable belief\nA person is said to have a \u2018reasonable belief\u2019 if an ordinary person with similar characteristics to the \naccused (e.g. age and maturity) would have formed the same belief in similar circumstances.\nIn rape cases, whether an accused reasonably believes the other person is consenting will depend \non the circumstances of each case. The court will consider any steps the accused took to determine the victim\u2019s consent. The accused\u2019s belief will be judged against the belief of a \u2018reasonable person\u2019 in similar circumstances. In general, an accused\u2019s belief will not be \u2018reasonable\u2019 if he or she knew the victim was not consenting, gave no thought to it or the accused\u2019s belief was unreasonable in the circumstances.\nIn cases involving alcohol or drug intoxication, the Crimes Act sets a standard to determine an accused\u2019s \nreasonable belief. This standard di\ufb00ers according to whether the case involves:\n\u2022 self-induced intoxication \u2013 Intoxication is considered to be self-induced unless it is involuntary or \ndue to fraud, sudden or extraordinary emergency, accident, reasonable mistake, duress, force, or the \ne\ufb00ects of proper use of prescription or non-prescription medication. In this situation, the court must compare the accused\u2019s belief or actions to those of a reasonable person who is not intoxicated\n\u2022 not self-induced intoxication \u2013 The court must compare the accused\u2019s belief or actions to those of a reasonable person intoxicated to the same level as the accused.\nPossible defences to rape\nEach indictable o\ufb00ence consists of speci\ufb01c elements. Failure to prove all elements will result in the accused being found not guilty of the crime, and the accused may try to argue that one of the elements is missing. For example, the accused may argue that:\n\u2022 the victim consented\u2022 the accused reasonably believed the victim was consenting\u2022 there was no \u2018sexual penetration\u2019 .\nIn rape cases, the issue of \u2018consent\u2019 is most often raised to excuse the accused\u2019s behaviour, as the \nfollowing news article exempli\ufb01es. Where consent is an issue, the de\ufb01nition of consent is used to \ndetermine whether the victim consented and whether the accused reasonably believed the victim was consenting. It is important to note that a victim does not have to say anything, protest, physically resist or sustain physical injury to show that he or she did not consent. It is also not a defence to say that the victim had agreed to a sexual act with the accused on a previous occasion.\nThe following news article further details defences in relation to a sleep rape case.A jury found Jurj guilty of five charges of rape and one charge of sexual penetration of a \nchild under 16. He was initially sentenced to 5 years and 5 months in prison. Daniel Miftode was found guilty of 10 charges of rape and was sentenced to 6 years and 9 months in prison. \nThe prosecution appealed the leniency of the sentence. The Court of Appeal increased Jurj\u2019s \nsentence to 9 years and 6 months in prison with a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months.

She  told  him that  if \nhe did not  stop  touching  her,  she  would go  and  \nsleep  in her car.\nGetachew  offered  to sleep  somewhere  else  \nbut she  replied:  \u2018Don\u2019t  worry  about  it. Just  don\u2019t  \ntouch  me and let me  sleep.\u2019  When she fell asleep,  \nshe had  her  back  to Getachew,  had  pulled  her  \ncoat  down  as far as possible,  buttoned  it up and  \nput her arms across  her chest.\nShe told  the  jury that  she  woke  up to find  \nGetachew  thrusting  into  her,  with her  skirt up  \nand her clothing  dishevelled.  When she  realised  \nwhat  he was doing,  she  pushed  him away  and  \nwent  out to  her car.\nIn a 2:1 majority  decision  earlier this  year,  the Court  of Appeal  found  trial  Judge  \nDuncan  Allen\u2019s  instructions  \u2013 that  the prosecution had  proved  intent  if Getachew  was  \naware  the woman might be asleep \u2013 amounted to a  substantial  miscarriage  of justice  and \nordered  a retrial.\nIn their  High Court  submissions,  Crown Prosecutor  Tom  Gyorffy  and  junior counsel  \nElizabeth  Ruddle  said that all the  cross-examination  of the woman was  \u2018premised  on the  \nfact that  she was asleep and could not  have known\u2019  that  Getachew  had penetrated  her.\nThey  said  that  an awareness  that  a person  might  be asleep  was  sufficient  to satisfy  \nthe \u2018might  not be consenting\u2019 section  of t he charge  of rape.\n\u2018It is only a freely given consent  which  is communicated  in some way that  can found a  \ndefence,\u2019  Mr Gyorffy and Ms Ruddle  submitted.\n\u2018The  effect of the  decision  of the Court of  Appeal  is that any belief about the consent of  \nthe complainant  \u2026 no matter how  ridiculous  or misguided  it may  be, can found a  defence.\u2019\nThey  argue  that that defeats  Parliament\u2019s  intent  because the law \u2018insists on a free and  \ncommunicated  consent\u2019.IN \nTHE \nNEWS\nSource 3 A High Court appeal in the Getachew case led to  change \nin rape law.\n05_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   130 17/10/2017   1:23 PM",
  "Page 143": "131  CHAPTER  5 INDICTABLE OFFENCESOther than defending the charge for  rape  on the basis that one or more of the elements has not been \nsatis\ufb01ed, the accused can rely  on a particular defence. Several defences to  a charge of  rape  are available. \nThese defences generally show that the accused did not or could not form  the intention (guilty mind) to  \ncommit the o\ufb00ence.\nThere are  three possible defences to  a charge of  rape.  These are:\n\u2022 mental impairment\n\u2022 duress\u2022 involuntary actions.\nDefence 1 \u2013 Mental impairment\nAnother defence that can be raised by  an accused is the mental impairment defence. A person is not \nguilty of  rape  if, at the time of the o\ufb00ence, they were  su\ufb00ering from a mental illness (or disease of the \nmind) and, as a result, they:\u2022 did not know what they were  doing because they had little understanding of the nature and quality of  \ntheir actions\n\u2022 did not know their conduct was  wrong or could not reason, or think about, their conduct like an \nordinary person.A successful defence of mental impairment does not immediately result in the accused being released \nfrom custody. That  is, the verdict is not an ordinary \u2018not guilty\u2019 verdict. Instead, it is a special verdict of \u2018not \nguilty by  reason of mental impairment\u2019 . \nIn these cases, the court will generally impose a custodial supervision order (i.e. an order that involves \nsome form  of detention or supervision \u2013 often in a medical facility). This order has a nominal term  of 25 \nyears, and con\ufb01nes the person to  a psychiatric facility so  appropriate care  and treatment can be provided. \nThe court will periodically review the order.\nDefence 2 \u2013 Duress\nA person is not guilty of  rape  if they act under duress. The  defence of duress applies if,  at the time of the \no\ufb00ence:\u2022 the person has a reasonable belief that:\n\u2022 a threat of harm exists\u2022 the threat would be carried out unless the o\ufb00ence was  committed\n\u2022 committing an o\ufb00ence is the only reasonable way  to avoid the threatened harm\n\u2022 the person\u2019s conduct is a reasonable response to  the threat.\nThere is no duress if the threat comes from a person with whom the accused voluntarily associates to  \ncommit an act of\n violence.\nRape  is generally understood by  psychologists to  be about power, not about sex. It is often about \nforcing someone to  submit. The  following case study illustrates circumstances in which the defence of  \nduress could be used to  defend a charge of  rape.\nChild  soldiers  forced  to rape\nIn 2003 in war-torn Sudan, Africa, children as young as 13 were  allegedly abducted and \nconscripted by force  into the Sudanese army. These newly-trained child soldiers were  then \nordered by superior officers to  commit offences including rape. They were  tortured if they did \nnot comply.CASE \nSTUDYmental impairment \na condition of the mind which impacts on a person\u2019s ability to  know \nthe nature and quality of his or her conduct, or that the conduct was wrong\n05_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   131 17/10/2017   1:23 PM",
  "Page 144": "132 UNIT 1  GUILT AND LIABILITYDefence 3 \u2013 Involuntary actions\nA person is not guilty of rape if their actions were involuntary. The \ninvoluntary nature of the accused\u2019s actions may mean that one or more elements of the crime cannot be met. While not technically a defence, the involuntary nature of the accused\u2019s actions may mean that a guilty mind (mens rea) cannot be proved. This may see the accused acquitted of the o\ufb00ence charged or found guilty of a lesser o\ufb00ence.\nFor a rape charge, the accused may claim that their actions were \ninvoluntary due to automatism. \nAutomatism\nAutomatism can be relied on where a person has a total loss of control over their bodily movements. Because they have completely lost control, it is accepted that they cannot form the intention to commit a crime, since they are not conscious or aware of what they are doing. Therefore, the action is considered to be involuntary. \nIt is not enough to say \u2018I didn\u2019t know what I was doing\u2019 . Some \nexternal factor had to be the sole cause of the actions. A person may be found not guilty of an o\ufb00ence if they committed the crime:\n\u2022 while sleeping or sleepwalking\u2022 while su\ufb00ering concussion\u2022 during an epileptic seizure\u2022 as a result of a medical condition or because of a side e\ufb00ect of the proper use of medication.\nAutomatism does not mean the person has a mental illness. Rather, the person is in a zombie-like \nstate and \u2018out of it\u2019 mentally, but capable of physical acts. For this reason it is sometimes called \u2018sane \nautomatism\u2019 to distinguish it from \u2018insane automatism\u2019 , which is also involuntary, but results from a mental illness. \nAutomatism is a defence that is extremely rare and di\ufb03cult to prove. \u2192 GOING FURTHER\nWhile the person who committed the rape may be found not guilty because of duress, the person who forced them to do it is guilty of a special kind of rape. It is a separate indictable offence, and it is called rape by compelling sexual penetration. \nSource 4 Sleepwalking is \none condition during in which \na person might commit an involuntary action. A sleeping person will not be capable of having intention (mens rea).In interviews reported in the media, a Sudanese army deserter, B Kajabier, then aged 34, \ndescribed what happened just before Sudanese army troops stormed a village in southern \nDarfur. The officer in charge, Colonel Jaja, commanded his troops to \u2018Rape the women, kill the children. Leave nothing\u2019. Kajabier refused to take part in any more raids and deserted. \nThe child soldier\u2019s conduct, and whether or not the defence of duress applies, have since \nbeen called into question. \nautomatism \na state in which a person has a total loss of control over their bodily movements (i.e. is not conscious or aware of what they are doing), so that they cannot form an intention to commit a crime\n05_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   132 17/10/2017   1:23 PM",

Under \ncommon law, rape was de\ufb01ned as carnal knowledge of a woman against her will. It was, however, a narrow crime in that it involved sexual intercourse. All sexual o\ufb00ences in Victoria are now governed by statute law, namely the Crimes Act. \nCommon law defences can be used to defend a rape charge. These include the defence of automatism, \nwhich is a defence found in the principles established by the courts over the years. \nStatute law\nEarly versions of the rape o\ufb00ence had wording like this: \u2018Whosoever shall be convicted of the crime of rape shall be guilty of felony, and, being convicted thereof, shall be liable to be imprisoned for life, with hard labour, and may be whipped.\u2019\nToday, rape laws across Australia have been modernised. Victoria\u2019s rape laws are found in the Crimes \nAct. The law has been amended signi\ufb01cantly over the years. The Crimes (Rape) Act 1991 (Vic) made \nsigni\ufb01cant changes to the law. Since then the law has been amended several times.\nAfter amendments were made in 2007, the prosecution no longer had to show that an accused was \naware that consent might be absent. It was enough to demonstrate that an accused did not give thought to whether the complainant was not consenting (or might not be consenting). The directions that judges gave to a jury were also regulated by the amendments.\nThe most important amendments over the years to rape laws include:\n\u2022 the criminalisation of rape in marriage \n\u2022 the use of gender-neutral language in the de\ufb01nition of rape\u2022 a statutory de\ufb01nition of sexual penetration and a broadening of this statutory de\ufb01nition to include all \nforms of sexual penetration\n\u2022 a statutory de\ufb01nition of consent which speci\ufb01es that consent means free agreement and outlines the circumstances in which a person does not consent\n\u2022 simpli\ufb01c ation of the fault element in rape. To be found guilty the prosecution must prove the accused \ndid not reasonably believe the other person consented to the penetration\n\u2022 restricting the admission of the victim\u2019s sexual history as evidence.\nThese changes aimed to clarify the de\ufb01nition of rape, the concept of consent and the mental element \nof rape. The changes re\ufb02ected recommendations made by the Victorian Law Reform Commission and a shift in community values and expectations. They were designed to encourage more victims to Victorian Law Reform \nCommission Victoria\u2019s leading independent law reform organisation. The VLRC reviews, researches and makes recommendations to the state parliament about possible changes to Victoria\u2019s laws\n05_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   134 17/10/2017   1:23 PM",

However, the changes \nalso made the law  complex and di\ufb03cult for  juries to  understand. Numerous appeals and retrials occurred \nbecause the law  could not be explained to  juries in a simple and straightforward way.\nTrends and statistics \nHistorically, many incidents of  rape  are not reported to  police. Some victims will not report for  fear of the \nlegal system. Personal factors such as cultural constraints and having a close  personal relationship with \nthe o\ufb00ender (in marital or date  rape  cases) may  impact on reporting rates.  Victims may  fear retaliation, \nsocial stigma or the negative impact on their privacy and family relationships. Underreporting could also \nbe due to  victims\u2019 perceptions that they will not be believed, or that the victim rather than the o\ufb00ender will \nbe blamed for  what happened.\nVictoria \nThe number of reported rapes in Victoria has steadily \nincreased from 62 to  73 per 100 000 population between \n2012 and 2016.  The  increase in reported rape  cases is,  at \n\ufb01rst glance, concerning. However, this increase may  be due \nto some victims being more willing to  report. There is a \ngreater awareness and support in our community for  victims \nof rape  and sexual assault. The  subject is no longer taboo \nand the legal system has implemented a series of reforms to make it easier for  victims to  report. Nonetheless, the legal \nsystem is still failing some rape  victims.\nVictorian Crimes Statistics Agency (CSA) data shows \nthat, in 2016, of the 4 416 rape  complaints to  police, 20 per cent remained unsolved, 15 per cent were  \nwithdrawn and 12 per cent had no o\ufb00ence detected. Sixteen per cent did not proceed beyond arrest and 35 per cent proceeded to  prosecution. \nThe CSA  also reported on case progression in other jurisdictions in its 2017 report on the \u2018Attrition of \nsexual o\ufb00ence incidents across the Victorian criminal justice system\u2019 . It found that New Zealand police charged 31 per cent of o\ufb00enders, while in the United Kingdom between 25 and 50 per cent of reported incidents got  beyond a police investigation. These progression rates  are similar to  those in Victoria.\nThe Sent\nencing Advisory Council records show that between 1 July  2011 and 30 June 2016:\n\u2022 there were  204 rape  cases heard by  the higher courts \n\u2022 the main age  group that committed the crime was  between 25\u201334 years \n\u2022 99.5 per cent of the o\ufb00enders were  male \n\u2022 95 per cent of the o\ufb00enders received a term  of imprisonment, with a median term  of 5 years. The  \nmaximum term  given for  a rape  crime during that time was  no more than 12 years.\nResearch indicates that progression rates  tend to  be better in cases where the victim reports to  police \nwithin a short time of the incident, when the victim was  injured or when the o\ufb00ender used a weapon or \nhad committed other crimes.  Conversely, progression rates  are not as good when the victim is a\ufb00ected by  \nalcohol or drugs or when the victim withdraws from the legal process due to  legal uncertainty and delays.\nQueensland\nReported rapes and attempted rapes in Queensland, over  a similar period, also increased from 29 to  35 \nper 100 000 population.

There remains, however, ongoing discontent with the sentences that are given for o\ufb00ences such as rape.\nPossible impacts of rape\nVictims su\ufb00er both physical and psychological trauma following a rape. A victim may su\ufb00er physical injuries such as bruising, bleeding or broken bones, depending on the force used during the sexual attack. The victim may also worry about the risk of sexually transmitted diseases or an unwanted pregnancy. Victims also su\ufb00er emotionally. They may feel anger, guilt or self-blame. They may be in shock or feel disoriented and they may in live in fear of future attack. Long-term psychological e\ufb00ects include the onset of depression or post-traumatic stress disorder.\nThe victim\u2019s partner, parents and other family members may become secondary victims. They may \nalso experience emotional and psychological trauma ranging from anger to feelings of helplessness and depression.\nThe degree of impact on the victim will, however, depend on a number of factors, such as:\n\u2022 the severity of the assault and any physical injuries sustained\n\u2022 the response of family members and/or friends\u2022 the victim\u2019s personal history and sense of self-worth\u2022 whether the o\ufb00ender is a family member or known to the victim prior to the attack\u2022 the response of police, medical practitioners and the legal system\u2022 the level of uncertainty and delays in the investigation or prosecution of their case\u2022 their treatment in court and whether they are satis\ufb01ed with the legal outcome in their case.\nMany of these are discussed in a fact sheet on the impact of sexual assault on women produced by \nthe Australian Institute of Family Studies.

In some circumstances, a person\u2019s behaviour may be considered dishonest if property is taken (without the owner\u2019s consent) but the accused was willing to pay for it.\nSection 73 of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) states that a person takes property \u2018honestly\u2019 rather than \n\u2018dishonestly\u2019 if they genuinely believed:\n\u2022 they had a legal right to take the property or were authorised by someone with that right\u2022 they would have the owner\u2019s consent in the particular circumstances \u2022 the owner of the property could not be found using reasonable steps.Theft is a general legal term meaning dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another, with the \nintention of permanently depriving the other of it without his or her consent. Stealing is a non-legal term \nfor theft. A person who steals is guilty of theft and a \u2018thief\u2019 is a person who steals.\nMost people recognise that theft is the taking of another person\u2019s property without the legal right to \ndo so, yet they do not realise that all theft, including minor thefts, like shoplifting, are indictable o\ufb00ences. Thefts under $100 000 or theft of a motor vehicle are generally dealt with summarily. This means minor theft cases will usually be heard in the Magistrates\u2019 Court.\nTheft is punishable by a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, and more serious cases of theft will \nbe heard in the County or Supreme Courts. The police may also give a \ufb01rst-time adult shoplifter an \u2018on the spot \ufb01ne\u2019 if the value of the goods stolen is less than $600.\nOther crimes, such as robbery or burglary, are a type of theft. theft \nthe act of dishonestly taking property belonging to another person (without his or her consent) with the intention of permanently depriving that person of it\nshoplifting \na general term used to describe a type of theft involving stealing of goods from a retail store.

Behaviours  that might  \nshow the  accused  is assuming  the rights of the  owner include  taking  and  keeping  the item,  using,  \ndevaluing,  or damaging  it, or trying  to sell it or give it  away.\nThe following  legal  case  is an example  of a theft  involving  property belonging  to the accused\u2019s  \nemployer.

In some circumstances, borrowing an item without the owner\u2019s consent \nmay be considered theft. For example, using a motor vehicle, in any manner, without the owner\u2019s consent is su\ufb03cient to prove the intention to permanently deprive the owner of their property. \nThe following examples explain what is intended by \u2018permanently deprive another\u2019 . \nIntention to permanently deprive another\n\u2022 A person receives property by mistake.

If you knowingly buy \nstolen goods you commit an offence. If you unknowingly buy a stolen item you do not commit a crime, but you may be required to return the item to the rightful owner.Did you know?\nWhether someone has committed theft will be determined by checking the offender\u2019s actions against each element of the offence and then considering any defences applicable in the circumstances of the case.Study tipPossible defences to theft\nEach indictable o\ufb00ence consists of speci\ufb01c elements. Failure to prove all elements will result in the \naccused being found not guilty of the crime, and the accused may try to argue that one of the elements is missing. For example, the accused may argue that:\n\u2022 the accused acted honestly rather than dishonestly\u2022 the accused took the item with the owner\u2019s consent\u2022 the property was abandoned when the accused took it\u2022 the accused made a reasonable and honest mistake in taking the item\u2022 the accused borrowed the item with the intention to give it back\u2022 the accused bought the item with a genuine and reasonable belief that the person who sold it had the \nright to do so.\n In some cases, the accused may be found guilty of an alternative o\ufb00ence should the elements for the \nalternative o\ufb00ence be proven.\nOther than defending the charge for murder on the basis that one or more of the elements has not \nbeen satis\ufb01ed, the accused can rely on a particular defence. Several defences to a charge of theft are \navailable. These defences generally show that the accused did not or could not form the intention (guilty mind) to commit the o\ufb00ence.\nThere are four possible defences to a charge of theft. These are:\n\u2022 mental impairment\n\u2022 duress\n05_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   140 17/10/2017   1:23 PM",
  "Page 153": "141  CHAPTER  5 INDICTABLE OFFENCES\u2022 sudden or extraordinary emergency\n\u2022 involuntary actions. \nDefence 1 \u2013 Mental impairment\nOne defence that can be raised by an accused is the mental impairment defence. A person is not guilty \nof theft if, at the time of the o\ufb00ence, they were su\ufb00ering from a mental illness (or disease of the mind) and, as a result, they:\n\u2022 did not know what they were doing because they had little understanding of the nature and quality of \ntheir actions\n\u2022 did not know their conduct was wrong or could not reason, or think about, their conduct like an ordinary person.\nA successful defence on the basis of mental impairment does not immediately result in the accused \nbeing released from custody. The verdict is not an ordinary \u2018not guilty\u2019 verdict. Instead, it is a special \nverdict of \u2018not guilty by reason of mental impairment\u2019 . \nIn these cases, the court will generally impose a custodial supervision order (i.e. an order that involves \nsome form of detention or supervision \u2013 often in a medical facility). This order has a nominal term of 25 years, and con\ufb01nes the person to a psychiatric facility so appropriate care and treatment can be provided. The court will periodically review the order.\nDefence 2 \u2013 Duress\nA person is not guilty of theft if they act under duress. The defence of duress applies if, at the time of the o\ufb00ence:\n\u2022 the person has a reasonable belief that:\n\u2022 a threat of harm exists\n\u2022 the threat would be carried out unless the o\ufb00ence was committed\u2022 committing an o\ufb00ence is the only reasonable way to avoid the threatened \nharm\n\u2022 the person\u2019s con\nduct is a reasonable response to the threat.\nThere is no duress if the threat comes from a person with whom the \naccused voluntarily associates to commit an act of violence.\nDefence 3 \u2013 Sudden or extraordinary \nemergency\nA person is not guilty of theft if they act as a result of a sudden or extraordinary emergency. The person \nmust reasonably believe that:\n\u2022 there is a sudden or extraordinary emergency\u2022 their actions are the only reasonable way of dealing with the situation\u2022 their actions are a reasonable response to the situation.\nFor example, the defence could be used by a person who runs into a hardware store and takes a \ufb01re \nextinguisher without permission because a car is on \ufb01re and ready to explode in a crowded street.\nDefence 4 \u2013 Involuntary actions\nA person is not guilty of theft if their actions were involuntary. The involuntary nature of the accused\u2019s \nactions may mean that one or more elements of the crime cannot be met. While not technically a defence, the involuntary nature of the accused\u2019s actions may mean that a guilty mind (mens rea) cannot be proved. This may see the accused acquitted of the o\ufb00ence charged or found guilty of a lesser o\ufb00ence.mental impairment \na condition of the mind which impacts on a person\u2019s ability to know the nature and quality of his or her conduct, or that the conduct was wrong\nduress \nstrong mental pressure on someone to overcome their independent will and force them to do something\nreasonable belief \nan honestly held opinion about the way things are, which would seem to another ordinary person with similar characteristics (e.g. age or maturity), in similar circumstances, to be sensible or correctcircumstances, to be sensible or correct\nSource 3 Under duress, a person may have no \noption but to obey and commit a crime.\n05_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   141 17/10/2017   1:23 PM",
  "Page 154": "142 UNIT 1  GUILT AND LIABILITYFor a theft charge, the accused may state that their \nactions were involuntary due to:\n\u2022 intoxication\u2022 automatism.\nIntoxication\nThe defence of intoxication exists at both common \nlaw (i.e. a common law defence) and statute law (i.e. a statutory defence). A person may be intoxicated by reason of consumption of alcohol, taking drugs, or some other substance. \nUnder common law, gross intoxication is a way of \nproving that the accused acted involuntarily or without intent. If the accused is so drunk or a\ufb00ected by drugs that he or she cannot form the intention to commit the crime, then the person may be found not guilty. This argument is rarely successful because the level of intoxication required to make a person\u2019s actions involuntary is extreme.\nIn addition, the Crimes Act speci\ufb01es the way a court is to deal with the issue of intoxication when it \nis raised in cases involving self-defence, duress and sudden or extraordinary emergency. These defences often require the court to assess whether a person\u2019s belief or response was \u2018reasonable\u2019 . In determining reasonableness, the court must use two tests based on whether the accused\u2019s intoxication was:\n\u2022 self-induced intoxication \u2013 Intoxication is considered to be self-induced unless it is involuntary or \ndue to fraud, sudden or extraordinary emergency, accident, reasonable mistake, duress, force, or the \ne\ufb00ects of proper use of prescription or non-prescription medication. In this situation, the court must compare the accused\u2019s belief or actions to those of a reasonable person who is not intoxicated.\n\u2022 not self-induced intoxication \u2013 The court must compare the accused\u2019s belief or actions to those of a reasonable person intoxicated to the same level as the accused.\nThe legal case below highlights an example of theft as a result of self-induced intoxication. automatism \na state in which a person has a total loss of control over their bodily movements (i.e. is not conscious or aware of what they are doing), so that they cannot form an intention to commit a crime\nself-induced intoxication the act of getting drunk of your own free will. Intoxication (i.e. drunkenness) is assumed to occur by a person\u2019s own actions unless there was a factor that made it involuntary\nSource 4 Gross intoxication can result \nin involuntary action. It is a defence a person accused of murder can raise.\nToo drunk to know right from wrong\nR v O\u2019Connor (1980) 146 CLR 64\nO\u2019Connor stabbed an off-duty policeman in an attempt to steal the policeman\u2019s car. He was \ncharged with theft and assault but argued that he did not intend to commit the crimes and that he could not remember the incident because of his consumption of a large quantity of alcohol and medication. He appealed his conviction and the appeal was allowed. The High Court of Australia, in a majority decision (4:3), ruled that while intoxication is not a separate defence it may be relevant in proving whether the accused acted voluntarily and with the intent to commit the crime.LEGAL \nCASEObtaining property by \ndeception or obtaining financial advantage by deception are two indictable offences which apply in fraudulent behaviour like when a person lies or deceives or \u2018scams\u2019 another person in order to commit a theft.Did you know?\nAutomatism\nAutomatism can be relied on where a person has a total loss of control over their bodily movements. \nBecause they have completely lost control, it is accepted that they cannot form the intention to commit a crime, since they are not conscious or aware of what they are doing. Therefore, the action is considered to be involuntary. \n05_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   142 17/10/2017   1:23 PM",

It has its origins in the common law o\ufb00ence of larceny, and the \ncourts still rely on case law to re\ufb01ne the elements of theft and draw out their true meaning.\nThe law of theft has developed over time. It has been expanded to go beyond the physical act of \n\u2018taking and carrying away\u2019 another\u2019s property.\nSome of the defences that can be used to defend a theft charge have their origins in common law. \nThese include automatism and gross intoxication, and continue to apply today.\nStatute law\nToday, the Crimes Act provides a basic de\ufb01nition of theft. New theft-related o\ufb00ences were created by the Victorian Parliament to cover behaviour such as credit card fraud, theft by electronic fund transfer or theft using electronic accounting systems. These acts do not always involve the physical act of taking \nsomeone\u2019s property; rather, the o\ufb00ender uses deception to gains a \ufb01nancial advantage.\nNew laws have also been created in response to the high prevalence of home burglaries and violent \nthefts of motor vehicles.

Theft and burglary make up 74 per \ncent of these o\ufb00ences. The  number of property and deception o\ufb00ences reported to  police is \ufb01ve  times \nhigher than reports taken for  other types of o\ufb00ences.\nThe Victorian Crime Statistics Agency (CSA) reported that in the year ending December 2016, 331 \n530 property and deception o\ufb00ences were  reported to  police \u2013 an 11 per cent increase from the previous \nyear. Of these, 58 per cent were  thefts, 17 per cent were  burglaries, 11 per cent were  deception o\ufb00ences \nand 14 per cent were  other types of property crime. This equates to  2787 thefts and 837 burglaries per \n100 000 (population) in 2015 and 3167 thefts and 904 burglaries per 100 000 in 2016. Some theft is not \nreported to  police, particularly where the property owner was  careless in securing the property or its value \nis low.\nThe Sentencing Advisory Council records that between 1 July  2011 to  30 June 2016, there were  3 239 \ntheft cases, which were  cases of theft of property other than a motor vehicle. Of those cases:\n\u2022 the main age  group that o\ufb00ended was  between 25 to  34 years \n\u2022 67.3 per cent of o\ufb00enders were  male \n\u2022 66.7 per cent of o\ufb00enders received a term  of imprisonment, with the median sentence being 2.5 years. \nQueensland\nThe Queensland Police Service collates its theft statistics di\ufb00erently, so  comparisons between the two  \njurisdictions are  limited.

  "Page 158": "146 UNIT 1  GUILT AND LIABILITYPossible impacts of theft\nTheft in our community a\ufb00ects both individuals and businesses alike because they bear the cost of \nreplacing stolen items. Excessive insurance claims will result in a rise in premiums, not only for victims of theft, but for all policy holders. Similarly, the ordinary consumer foots the bill for shop stealing. Stores generally compensate for lost revenue with price rises.\nTheft can cause inconvenience, anxiety and distress for victims, particularly if they have lost \nirreplaceable or sentimental items or if their home has been burgled. Violent theft-related crimes, like robberies, can be traumatic for victims leaving them with long-term mental health issues.\nBusinesses and individuals, fearing future thefts, will increase store and home security because they \nare distrustful of others. This comes at a cost. Too many theft-related o\ufb00ences like robberies, burglaries, home invasions and carjackings in an area can also a\ufb00ect property prices, and drive out businesses, as people do not want to live, visit or work in an unsafe neighbourhood.\nSource 3 lists some of the possible impacts that theft can have on individuals (i.e. the o\ufb00enders, victims \nand their families) and society.\nPOSSIBLE IMPACTS OF THEFT\nIMPACTS ON THE OFFENDER IMPACTS ON VICTIMS AND \nTHEIR FAMILIESIMPACTS ON SOCIETY\n\u2022 Legal c osts\n\u2022 Possible custodial \nsentence\n\u2022 Lost labour and income in \nthe household\n\u2022 Impact on the family\u2019s \nsocial standing, finances \nand health and well-being\u2022 Loss of property\u2022 Trauma, grief and loss and \nrelated medical issues\n\u2022 Continuing psychological \nissues\n\u2022 Loss of trust in law and \norder and community values\u2022 Increased need for police, \nfire and emergency services\n\u2022 Loss of trust in law and \norder and community values\n\u2022 Fear of property being \nstolen from them \nSource 3 A summary of the impacts of theftNUMBER OF REPORTED OFFENCES OF THEFT IN QUEENSLAND  (2011/endash.case2016) \nNUMBER\nYear 2011\u201312 2012\u201313 2013\u201314 2014\u201315 2015\u201316\nReported offences  104/uni00A0315  104/uni00A0236  98/uni00A0914 96/uni00A0308  102/uni00A0277\nRATE PER 100 000 PERSONS\nYear 2011\u201312 2012\u201313 2013\u201314 2014\u201315 2015\u201316\nReported offences  2/uni00A0284  2/uni00A0241  2/uni00A0096  2/uni00A0015  2/uni00A0114\nSource: Queensland Police Service,/uni00A0Region and District/uni00A0Crime Statistics/uni00A01 July 2011 to 30 June 2016\nSource 2 In Queensland, the number of reported offences of theft fluctuates from year to year.

In general, \nthis Act covers less serious or minor o\ufb00ences against people, property, public order and public decency. \nThis chapter explores four summary o\ufb00ences:\n\u2022 assault\n\u2022 public drunkenness (i.e. being drunk in a public place) \n\u2022 o\ufb00ensive behaviour\n\u2022 gra\ufb03ti o\ufb00ences.For each summary o\ufb00ence, you will consider the elements of the o\ufb00ence, possible defences, the role \nof statute and common law in developing the elements and the defences, trends and statistics and the \npossible impact of the o\ufb00ence on individuals and society.\nElements of summary offences\nLike indictable o\ufb00ences, all summary o\ufb00ences consist of speci\ufb01c elements that make up the o\ufb00ence. All elements must be proved, beyond reasonable doubt, before a person can be found guilty of the o\ufb00ence. The speci\ufb01c elements of a crime can be found in either a sta tutory de\ufb01nition of the o\ufb00ence (in Acts of \nParliament) or its common law de\ufb01nition (developed through judge-made law).\nThe speci\ufb01c elements of a crime can be divided into two types:\n\u2022 elements that prove the accused committed a guilty act (i.e. actus reus)\n\u2022 elements that prove the accused had a guilty mind (i.e.  mens rea) when the o\ufb00ence was committed.summary o\ufb00ence \na minor offence generally heard in the Magistrates\u2019 Court\nsanction \na penalty (e.g. a fine or prison sentence) imposed by a court on a person guilty of a criminal offence\nassault  \nthe intentional or reckless use of force or the threat of force against another person without a lawful excuse \ndrunk  \nwhen a person\u2019s physical or mental faculties or judgment are appreciably and materially impaired by alcohol, drugs or another substance, resulting in a substantial lack of capacity or control\npublic place  \nan area or location considered open to the public (i.e. anyone in the community has a right to go there)\no\ufb00ensive behaviour  \nconduct that is calculated to wound feelings or arouse anger, resentment, disgust, or outrage in the mind of a reasonable person\ngra\ufb03ti  \nany illegal writing, drawing or scratching that defaces (i.e. damages) public property and cannot be removed with a dry clothstatute law  law made by parliament; also known as legislation or Acts of Parliament (as opposed to common law)\ncommon law \nlaw made by judges through decisions made in cases; also known as case law or judge-made law (as opposed to statute law)\nSource 1 Littering is a summary offence under the Environment Protection Act 1970 (Vic).\nIt is an offence in Victoria to roll a drum, barrel or cask in a public place, or break in a horse to the injury of or danger to any person or damage to any property.

  "Page 165": "153  CHAPTER 6  SUMMAR Y OFFENCESIn general, the prosecutor must prove all elements are present in a case before the accused can be \nfound guilty. For this reason, the prosecution will charge the accused with crimes that best match the \naccused\u2019s behaviour and actions at the time of the o\ufb00ence.\nUnlike the serious crimes you may have learnt about in Chapter 5 (indictable o\ufb00ences), some \nsummary o\ufb00ences do not require the prosecution to prove a mental element such as intention or recklessness. \nPossible defences for summary offences\nWhen a person is charged with a criminal o\ufb00ence they can usually raise a defence of some kind. Even for a strict liability  o\ufb00ence (one that does not require the existence of mens rea  for a person to \nbe found guilty), limited defences are available. \nFor each of the minor o\ufb00ences explored in these chapters, you will consider the defences that can \nbe raised by an accused who is charged with these o\ufb00ences. \nDevelopment of the law\nAlthough most law related to summary o\ufb00ences is found in Acts of Parliament, quite often the act does not de\ufb01ne important concepts that have developed through case law. As such, common law de\ufb01nitions and principles that are relevant to de\ufb01ning the elements of the o\ufb00ence, and the defences that can be raised for each crime, still apply. \nFor each summary o\ufb00ence in this chapter, you will look at the role of both the parliament and the \ncourts in developing the elements and the defences associated with that o\ufb00ence.\nTrends and statistics\nDue to the importance of crime and its e\ufb00ects on individuals and the community, government agencies and other organisations record and analyse crime statistics .\nThe amount of crime occurring in a community (the number of individual o\ufb00ences of the same \ntype) is called the incidence of crime.  The Victorian Crime Statistics Agency (CSA) gathers and reports on the incidents of crime in Victoria.  \nThese statistics are collected and may be compared with those in other states and countries so \nthe government can determine the amount of crime in our community, measure the e\ufb00ectiveness of law enforcement agencies and plan for the best use of resources so our society is as crime-free as possible. crime statistics  \ninformation (i.e. data) collected by authorities such as the police and analysed to track the level of crime or offending in the community. Crime statistics also track the types and levels of sentence given to convicted offendersSummary o\ufb00ences are minor o\ufb00ences, generally heard in the Magistrates\u2019 Court by a magistrate. If the \naccused is guilty of an o\ufb00ence, the magistrate then imposes a sanction (penalty). \nSummary o\ufb00ences cover a wide range of behaviour and come from di\ufb00erent Acts of Parliament. \nSummary o\ufb00ences often occur in the community and a signi\ufb01cant number of minor o\ufb00ences are heard in the Magistrates\u2019 Court every year.  \nIn Victoria, many summary o\ufb00ences are contained in the Summary O\ufb00ences Act 1966 (Vic).

In this graph,  \u2018Crimes against the person\u2019 would include \u2018Assault and related o\ufb00ences\u2019 , which \ncan be either a summary or indictable o\ufb00ence depending on the circumstances. In contrast, the \u2018Other \no\ufb00ence\u2019 category contains driving o\ufb00ences, public transport o\ufb00ences and other government regulatory o\ufb00ences which are  generally summary o\ufb00ences. Another problem is that large numbers of o\ufb00ences are  \ngrouped together in a single category. For  indictable o\ufb00ences, this is less of a problem (e.g. there are  \nonly a handful of di\ufb00 erent homicide o\ufb00ences). However, for  summary o\ufb00ences, having large numbers of  \ndi\ufb00erent o\ufb00ences under a single category can make a big di\ufb00erence to  the statistics. \nImpacts of summary offences on the community \nSummary o\ufb00ences are  everyday o\ufb00ences, committed by  a small but signi\ufb01cant portion of the community \nwith relative frequency. These crimes have  a negative impact on the victim, but it is less likely to  be life-\nchanging than the indictable o\ufb00ences discussed in Chapter 5. While they are  not as serious as indictable \no\ufb00ences, taken together, summary o\ufb00ences can still have  a major impact on individuals and society as a \nwhole. They  erode trust, damage our shared values and reduce our enjoyment of a peaceful, cooperative \ncommunity.\nAs you  will learn in this chapter, individuals, communities or businesses can su\ufb00er physical, \ufb01nancial \nor psychological damage as the victims of summary o\ufb00ences. \nWhile summary o\ufb00ences are  considered less serious than indictable o\ufb00ences, they can still lead to  \nnegative consequences for  o\ufb00enders, such as a criminal record. This case study further introduces the \nsummary o\ufb00ence of littering.Crime statistics are \noften expressed as a number per 100 000 (e.g. 5 per 100 000). This means for every 100 000 people, five of them will be a victim of that crime.

  "Page 168": "156  UNIT  1 GUILT AND LIABILITY6.2 ASSAULT \u2013 ELEMENTS & DEFENCES\nIn simple terms, assault is as an act that does physical harm (or threatens to do physical harm) to \nanother person. Assault is an old o\ufb00ence that developed through case law dating back hundreds of years in England. In Victoria today, it is now de\ufb01ned in the Summary O\ufb00ences Act 1966 (Vic). Like all summary o\ufb00ences, assault is heard in the Magistrates\u2019 Court; however, serious assaults can be considered indictable o\ufb00ences. This means they will be heard in one of the higher courts.\nOver the centuries, as court decisions clari\ufb01ed and re\ufb01ned the common law de\ufb01nition of assault, \nadditional legal principles have been established through judicial interpretation. They include as follows: \n\u2022 assault can be committed by the use of force, a threat, or an attempt to use force against another\n\u2022 force in an assault can be slight, as long as there is some form of contact. It need not result in injury \nor harm\n\u2022 in general, words alone are not an assault unless there is an accompanying threatening gesture like a raised \ufb01st, the cutting of the throat with a \ufb01nger or the positioning of the thumb and fore\ufb01nger to signify the \ufb01ring of a gun\n\u2022 the victim must be aware of the threat and reasonably believe that the threat will be carried out then and there. This is not about what the o\ufb00ender intends but what the victim believes might happen\n\u2022 while some threats by phone may constitute an assault, a threat made in a long-distance phone call does not place the victim in imminent danger and is not an assault\n\u2022 words can sometimes constitute a threat or undo a threat, as further detailed in the example below.assault  \nthe intentional or reckless use of force or the threat of force against another person without a lawful excuse\nWords as a threat\nUttering the words \u2018Shut your mouth or else\u2019 as the person is walking towards their victim is a \nthreat, but saying \u2018If I wasn\u2019t in a such a hurry I\u2019d come over and shut your mouth\u2019 is not a threat as the person has indicated they do not have the time to act.EXAMPLE\nSource 1 Threatening words are different in character from \u2018blowing your stack\u2019 through frustration.In old cases, a \ndistinction was made between common assault (the threat to inflict force) and battery (the actual force). Assault has developed as a concept so that it now covers both a threat and a physical contact. This means the term \u2018battery\u2019 is essentially obsolete in the criminal law.Did you know?\n06_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   156 17/10/2017   1:40 PM",
  "Page 169": "157  CHAPTER  6 SUMMAR Y OFFENCESWhile there is no physical harm from spitting, the feeling of disgust and also a fear of disease make \nspitting a particularly o\ufb00ensive assault, as highlighted in the following legal case.  \nDrive-thru spat ends in aggravated assault\nAbdul-Rahim, Broadmeadows Magistrates\u2019 Court  \n(unreported, 6 April 2016)\nOn 13 January 2016, a  25-year-old Melbourne man by \nthe name of  Hassan Abdul-Rahim argued with staff and \nspat at a  McDonald\u2019s Drive-Thru attendant because \nhe had to  wait for  his order. During the incident, the \nman honked his horn, refused to  move  his car  and \nspat a  large amount of  saliva at  the 19-year-old female \nattendant, getting it on her face  and in her mouth. The \nvictim said she was  traumatised by the event. Abdul-\nRahim was  charged with unlawful assault, aggravated \nassault and unlicensed driving as a result of the \nincident. He  pleaded guilty in  the Magistrates\u2019 Court to  \naggravated assault. \nIn court, the man said he was  frustrated at having to  \nwait, although the police said the delay was  only 20 or 30  \nseconds. He admitted to  clearing his throat and spitting  \nin the woman\u2019s direction but said he had no intention of  \nspitting at her. Lawyers said the man was  remorseful  \nand gave himself up to  police after seeing media reports about the incident. The man was on  bail \nfor other offences at the time of the incident. He was sentenced to  one month in prison.LEGAL\nCASE\nThere  are many  di\ufb00erent  types  of assault.  Some  are quite  minor  and do not involve  serious violence  \nor harm,  while  others  are serious  and violent.  Likewise,  some  assaults  are direct  (e.g. involving  a push,  \npunch  or physical  blow) while  others  are indirect  (e.g.  involving  an object  being  thrown or spitting).  \nRegardless  of type,  all assaults  share  some common  characteristics.  That is,  they  involve  the \nintentional  or reckless  use of force  (or threat of force)  against  another  person  without lawful  excuse.  \nThe seriousness  of the  assault  depends  on the actions  of the  o\ufb00ender and  the degree  of harm  caused \nto the victim.  Where the  victim  su\ufb00ers  an injury  or serious  injury  (requiring  medical  attention  or \nhospitalisation)  the assault  is more likely  to be an indictable  o\ufb00ence.  A serious  threat can also  be an \nindictable  o\ufb00ence;  for example,  a threat to  kill or in\ufb02ict  serious  injury.  Less  serious  threats or minor  \nassaults  will be dealt  with  as summary  o\ufb00ences.intentional \nsomething deliberate; not an accident\nreckless \nacting, or not acting, with conscious awareness of the potential harm that is likely to  be suffered\nSource 2 In 2016, a Melbourne man spat at a McDonald\u2019s Drive-Thru attendant.

This force does not  \nneed to  be violent, as even  a slight touch can in some instances be considered assault. The  following  \nexample demonstrates how  violent force (e.g. physically punching and head-butting another) will constitute  \nan assault.  It is an offence in \nVictoria to  drive a dog \nor goat harnessed or attached to  a vehicle \nin or through a public place.Did you know?\n06_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   158 17/10/2017   1:40 PM",
  "Page 171": "159  CHAPTER 6  SUMMAR Y OFFENCESElement 2 \u2013 The application or threat of force was \nintentional and reckless\nThis means that at the time of the assault, the accused intended to deprive the complainant of liberty, or \ncause discomfort, insult, damage, injury or pain. An accused\u2019s reckless conduct can also be used to prove \nthat they acted with the intention to commit an assault o\ufb00ence. \nSome assault cases attract media attention, which may be just what the o\ufb00ender was after, as \nhighlighted in the following legal case.Night out leads to unlawful assault\nThese facts, or something like them, are heard over and over again in every Magistrates\u2019 Court in Victoria. A 22-year-old man is charged with unlawful assault for punching and head-butting a 21-year-old nightclub patron. The pair got into an argument when the victim struck up a conversation with a girl who was also at the club. The victim was left with a bruised cheek and a bump on his forehead.\nThe man pleaded guilty in the Magistrates\u2019 Court. He was fined $1000 without conviction and \nplaced on a good behaviour bond for 12 months.EXAMPLE\nRacecourse antics land woman in court\nSarah Finn, Melbourne Magistrates\u2019 Court (unreported, 11 February \n2016)\nOn Melbourne Cup Day in 2015, a 25-year-old \nwoman, Sarah Finn, was charged with assaulting police when she recklessly pushed an Acting Superintendent, Steven Cooper, into bushes at the Flemington Racecourse. The officer was in uniform at the time and was waiting to address the media (see Source 4). He was on his phone when the woman struck, in full view of the media cameras. The woman\u2019s motive was to \u2018get on the news\u2019. She later admitted to being \u2018tipsy\u2019 and apologised for her behaviour. She pleaded guilty in the Magistrates\u2019 Court and was fined $800. She was ordered to pay $117 in costs and $150 in compensation for the officer\u2019s broken glasses.LEGAL\nCASE\nElement 3 \u2013 No lawful justification or excuse\nThis means that the person who committed the assault did so without any authority, or beyond the level authorised by the law. An example of a lawful assault where a person was legally able to use force is when a police o\ufb03cer arrests a person, and when doing so, uses reasonable force. \nSource 4 Sarah Finn shown punching Acting Superintendent \nSteven Cooper on Melbourne Cup Day in 2015\n06_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   159 17/10/2017   1:40 PM",
  "Page 172": "160  UNIT  1 GUILT AND LIABILITYPossible defences to assault\nFailure to prove all elements will result in the accused being found not guilty of the crime, therefore the \naccused may try to argue that one of the elements is missing. For example, the accused may argue that:\n\u2022 there was no intention or reckless conduct \u2022 there was no force or threat of force.  \nOther than defending the charge for assault on the basis that one or more of the elements has not been \nsatis\ufb01ed, the accused can otherwise rely on a particular defence. There are eight possible defences to a \ncharge of assault. These are:\n\u2022 consent\u2022 lawful correction of a child \u2022 lawful arrest\u2022 self-defence\u2022 mental impairment\u2022 duress\u2022 sudden or extraordinary emergency\u2022 involuntary actions.\nDefence 1 \u2013 Consent \nA person cannot be convicted of assault if their actions were consensual. Consent is a partial defence, \nmeaning that it does not completely absolve the accused of an assault charge. This defence will depend on the circumstances in which the assault was committed and the degree of harm in\ufb02icted. In general, a person cannot consent to an unlawful act or to the in\ufb02iction of a serious injury or grievous bodily harm. \nWe regularly consent to medical treatments that would be an assault if it were not a medical procedure \n(e.g. dental extraction of a tooth, or injection of a \ufb01nger). When participating in everyday activities we also accept or consent to physical contact which is reasonable and acceptable in the circumstances. We accept that we may be tapped on the shoulder, patted on the back or bumped on a crowded street.\nDefence 2\u2013 Lawful correction of a child \nA person may be convicted of assault if they smack a child. However, it will not be an assault as long as it is reasonable in all the circumstances and is genuinely intended for correction (not an angry beating).\nThat is, parents (or their representative) who smack a child as a form of discipline must do so within \nstrict parameters. The physical act must not be unreasonable or excessive. It must be appropriate to the child\u2019s age and physical or mental development. The following legal case outlines an example where a parent\u2019s discipline was considered reasonable.\nSmacking must be reasonable\nPolice v G, DM [2016] SASC 39 (21 March 2016) \nA divorced man, who was a pilot in the military, smacked his son three times in response to disrespectful behaviour. The boy reported the incident to police during a visit with his mother. The father was found guilty of aggravated assault in the Magistrates\u2019 Court of South Australia.\nJustice Peek of the Supreme Court of South Australia, on appeal, decided the man\u2019s actions \nwere lawful. The judge said three slaps to the boy\u2019s thigh, resulting in red marks but no bruising, were reasonable in the circumstances. The father had previously tried to reason with the boy and had given him time-out to consider his behaviour.LEGAL\nCASE\n06_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   160 17/10/2017   1:40 PM",

If the arrest is lawful, they can arrest the person using reasonable force. \nReasonable force depends on the circumstances. Little force would be required to detain a cooperative \nor compliant o\ufb00ender, but police may use more force when an o\ufb00ender is resisting arrest. A police o\ufb03cer who uses excessive force is going beyond authority and can be found charged with assault, as highlighted in the following legal case.  \nFrustrated police officer guilty of assault\nDean Bradley Anderson, Melbourne Magistrates\u2019 Court (unreported, \n9/uni00A0October 2014)\nOn 13 December 2012, a commuter, Anton Perry, was asked to show his ticket and give his \nname, but he refused repeatedly. He was then arrested and taken to a police cell at Flinders Street Station. While he was there he was verbally aggressive, and a 40-year-old senior constable pushed him into a wall, wrestled him to the ground, then stood over him, grabbed him by or near the throat and handcuffed him. All this was captured on CCTV. Charged with assault, the officer pleaded not guilty, saying he feared his male victim was going to spit on him. He said he had a heightened fear of being spat on due to a spitting incident earlier in his career, requiring him to be tested for HIV and Hepatitis C.\nIn October 2014, Magistrate Elizabeth Lambden \nfound that he had acted beyond his legal authority, out of frustration, and that he was not acting in self-defence. She found him guilty but did not record a conviction. He was required to serve a 12-month community correction order, and as part of the order was required to perform 150 hours of unpaid community work.LEGAL\nCASE\nSource 5 Flinders Street Station in \nMelbourne, where Mr Perry was assaulted by a policer officer\nDefence 4 \u2013 Self-defence\nA person will not be convicted of assault if: \n\u2022 they believed that their actions were necessary in self-defence \u2022 their actions were reasonable in the circumstances as the person perceived them.\nIn family violence cases, the accused\u2019s actions may be considered \u2018reasonable in the circumstances as \nthe person perceives them\u2019 even if:\u2022 the person responds to harm that is not immediate\u2022 the person responds with excessive force.

That is, the verdict is not an ordinary \u2018not guilty\u2019 verdict. Instead, it is a special verdict of \u2018not \nguilty by reason of mental impairment\u2019 . \nIn these cases, the court will generally impose a custodial supervision order (i.e. an order that involves \nsome form of detention or supervision \u2013 often in a medical facility). This order has a nominal term of 25 years, and con\ufb01nes the person to a psychiatric facility so appropriate care and treatment can be provided. The court will periodically review the order.\nDefence 6 \u2013 Duress\nA person will not be convicted of assault if they act under duress. The defence of duress applies if, at the time of the o\ufb00ence:\n\u2022 the person has a reasonable belief that:\n \u2013 a threat of harm exists\n \u2013 the threat would be carried out unless the o\ufb00ence was committed\n\u2022 committing an o\ufb00ence is the only reasonable way to avoid the threatened harm\u2022 the person\u2019s conduct is a reasonable response to the threat.\nThere is no duress if the threat comes from a person with whom the accused voluntarily associates to \ncommit an act of violence.\nDefence 7 \u2013 Sudden or extraordinary emergency\nA person will not be convicted of assault if they act as a result of a sudden or extraordinary emergency.  \nThe person must reasonably believe that:\n\u2022 there is a sudden or extraordinary emergency\u2022 their actions are the only reasonable way of dealing with the situation\u2022 their actions are a reasonable response to the situation.\nTo grab or push a person is an assault and legal action may follow.  However, if this is done to save the \nother person (e.g. from being hit by a large tree limb) this defence could apply. The court will consider the \ngravity of the emergency, whether the person\u2019s actions were the only way of dealing with the situation, and whether they were reasonable in the circumstances.\nDefence 8 \u2013 Involuntary acts \nA person will not be convicted of assault if their actions were involuntary. The involuntary nature of the accused\u2019s actions may mean that one or more elements of the o\ufb00ence cannot be met. While not technically a defence, the involuntary nature of the accused\u2019s actions may mean that a guilty mind (mens rea) cannot be proved.

  "Page 175": "163  CHAPTER 6  SUMMAR Y OFFENCESSource 6 Gross \nintoxication can \nresult in involuntary action. It is a defence a person accused of assault can raise.\nFor an assault charge, the accused may state that their actions were involuntary \ndue to:\n\u2022 intoxication\u2022 automatism \n\u2022 accident. \nIntoxication\nThe defence of intoxication exists at both common law (i.e. a common law \ndefence) and statute law (i.e. a statutory defence). A person may be intoxicated by reason of consumption of alcohol, taking drugs, or some other substance. \nUnder common law , gross intoxication is a way of proving that the accused \nacted involuntarily or without intent. If the accused is so drunk or a\ufb00ected by drugs that he or she cannot form the intention to commit the crime, then the person may be found not guilty. This defence is rarely successful because the level of intoxication required to make a person\u2019s actions involuntary is extreme.\nIn addition, the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) speci\ufb01es the way a court is to deal with intoxication when \nit is raised in cases involving self-defence, duress and sudden or extraordinary emergency. These defences often require the court to assess whether a person\u2019s belief or response was \u2018reasonable\u2019. In determining reasonableness, the court must use two tests based on whether the accused\u2019s intoxication was:\n\u2022 self-induced intoxication  \u2013 Intoxication is considered to be self-induced unless it is involuntary \nor due to fraud, sudden or extraordinary emergency, accident, reasonable mistake, duress, force, \nor the e\ufb00ects of proper use of prescription or non-prescription medication. In this situation, the court must compare the accused\u2019s belief or actions to those of a reasonable person who is not intoxicated\n\u2022 n ot self-induced intoxication \u2013 The court must compare the accused\u2019s belief or actions to those \nof a reasonable person intoxicated to the same level as the accused.\nAutomatism\nAutomatism can be relied on where a person has a total loss of control over their bodily movements. Because they have completely lost control, it is accepted that they cannot form the intention to commit a crime, since they are not conscious or aware of what they are doing. Therefore, the action is considered to be involuntary. \nIt is not enough to say \u2018I didn\u2019t know what I was doing\u2019. Some external factor had to be the sole \ncause of the actions. A person may be found not guilty of an o\ufb00ence if they committed the crime:\n\u2022 w hile sleeping or sleepwalking\n\u2022 w hile su\ufb00ering concussion\n\u2022 d uring an epileptic seizure\n\u2022 a s a result of a medical condition or because of a side e\ufb00ect of the proper use of medication.\nAutomatism does not mean the person has a mental illness. Rather, the person is in a zombie-like state \nand \u2018out of it\u2019 mentally, but capable of physical acts. For this reason it is sometimes called \u2018sane automatism\u2019 \nto distinguish it from \u2018insane automatism\u2019 , which is also involuntary, but results from a mental illness. \nAutomatism is a defence that is extremely rare and di\ufb03cult to prove. automatism \na state in which a person has a total loss of control over their bodily movements (i.e. is not conscious or aware of what they are doing), so that they cannot form an intention to commit a crime\nself-induced \nintoxication the act of getting drunk of your own free will.

The old \ncommon law  o\ufb00ence of assault is still relevant in all cases of assault, even  where an Act of Parliament \ndeals with the o\ufb00ence speci\ufb01cally. That  is because the word  \u2018assault\u2019 is not de\ufb01ned in statute. This means \nthe de\ufb01nition of \u2018assault\u2019 comes from common law  and not from statute law.\nMany of the defences that can be used to  defend an assault charge are  common law  defences. These \ninclude intoxication, automatism and accident as involuntary acts. Other common law  defences such as \nself-defence have  been abolished by  statute.\nStatute law\nThe Victorian Parliament has created a range of  assault-related crimes in statute law  as the need arose.  \nThe Parliament has established a number of serious assaults in the Crimes Act  1958 (Vic). For  example, it \nis a serious crime to  either intentionally or recklessly cause injury or serious injury and to  threaten to  kill \nor seriously injury another person. \nMinor assaults are  outlined in the Summary O\ufb00ence Act . The  o\ufb00ences of common assault and \naggravated  assault in the Summary O\ufb00ences Act  have  remained relatively unchanged since the Act  was  \npassed in 1966, because the meaning of assault continues to  evolve  through case law.\nA signi\ufb01cant legislative change did occur in 2014 in relation to  health care  professionals. Section 51A  \nwas inserted in the Summary O\ufb00ences Act  speci\ufb01cally to  protect health practitioners from assault.  The law \nnow protects all registered health practitioners from assault while they are  working and providing care  for \npatients. This became necessary after medical facilities and hospitals reported a  major increase in violence  \nagainst sta\ufb00  from patients a\ufb00ected by  alcohol and drugs. The  law was  also broadened to  protect all  \nemergency services workers on duty, not just police, from summary and indictable assault and to  increase  \nthe penalties which apply in such cases. A  further legisla tive change is described in the article below.  \nVictorian paramedics to  wear cameras to  help counter \nassaults\nGrant McArthur, Sunday Herald Sun, 18 December 2016\nVictorian paramedics will wear cameras to  protect them from spiralling rates of assault as \nthey are  confronted with 13 violent call-outs each day.

  "Page 178": "166  UNIT  1 GUILT AND LIABILITYTrends and statistics\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics\u2019 crime victimisation survey seeks information about both reported \nand unreported crimes. The 2015\u201316 survey showed that of the 8.9 million people aged 15 years and over in Australia, 2.4 per cent had experienced at least one physical assault over the past year, while 2.9 per cent experienced at least one threatened assault. Many of the people surveyed said they were involved in more than one incident.\nIn Australia, the assault rate (per 100 0 00 people) is steadily increasing. Assaults are most frequent \nin houses (42 per cent). They also occur in streets (24 per cent), in shops (13 per cent) and in recreational locations such as parks and sports grounds (6 per cent) or backyards (3 per cent).\nOne form of assault that appears to be underreported is sexual harassment. Most of these events \nare never reported to police, or even discussed with friends, family or service workers. They may be laughed o\ufb00 as a joke, but they can have serious negative e\ufb00ects on victims.   \nVictoria and New South Wales \nA comparison of data in Source 1 and Source 2 indicates that the number of reported assaults in Victoria is on the rise, while the number in New South Wales remains static. In 2016, the total number of assaults in Victoria increased by 11 per cent. However, recorded assaults in New South Wales outstripped those in Victoria by about one-third (20 000). Some, not all, of this di\ufb00erence may be attributed to the larger New South Wales population (approximately 1.5 million more people than Victoria).\nThere has been an increase in family violence reports in Victoria, but similar data \nfrom New South Wales shows no signi\ufb01cant change. In both states, family\u2013violence \nrelated assaults represent approximately half of the total assaults recorded. \nThis indicates that family violence is a signi\ufb01cant issue in our community. Victoria has tried to address the issue with a Royal Commission into Family \nViolence. Its report and recommendations were published in 2016. This may \nhave encouraged police and the legal system to review their procedures so victims \nwill have faith in the law and be willing to make a family violence complaint.\nSource 1 Assault can result in serious \nor minor injuries.against people who assault paramedics. In the past year, paramedics attended more than 5000 emergency cases where they were exposed to violence or aggression.\nThe cameras are being rolled out in a $500 000 trial under the \u2026 Government\u2019s Health \nService Violence Prevention Fund. [The Victorian Health] Minister \u2026 said threats, abuse and assaults against paramedics were unacceptable. \u2018Sadly, more and more paramedics are confronted by violence while they are doing their job saving lives,\u2019 she said.\nWhile trying to help a drunk woman after she was booted out of a western suburbs pub \nrecently, paramedic Shelly Brown, 34, was punched in the face and slapped despite police being present. \u2018They will help us feel safe, especially in the city. If people know they are being recorded, hopefully they will be fettered from hitting, kicking, spitting and abusing us as we just try to go about our job,\u2019 she said.\n06_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   166 17/10/2017   1:40 PM",

  "Page 181": "169  CHAPTER 6  SUMMAR Y OFFENCESPUBLIC DRUNKENNESS \u2013 ELEMENTS & \nDEFENCES6.4 \nIn Victoria, the law allows people over the age of 18 to drink alcohol in public places (unless these public \nplaces have been declared alcohol-free zones). Although the law allows people to drink in many public places, it does not permit people to be drunk in public. This is an o\ufb00ence under Victorian law known as public drunkenness. Victoria and Queensland are the only two Australian states that have laws \ngoverning public drunkenness. All other states and territories have decriminalised public drunkenness.\nPolice may suspect a person is drunk in public if their speech, co-ordination, balance or behaviour is \nnoticeably a\ufb00ected. Under the Summary O\ufb00ences Act 1966 (Vic), there are three o\ufb00ences relating to public drunkenness that police may charge an o\ufb00ender with. These include:\n\u2022 Dr unk in a public place \u2013 that is seen or discovered in a public place by police or protective service \no\ufb03cers. No disruptive or disorderly conduct need occur. \n\u2022 Dr unk and disorderly in a public place \u2013 this is when a person is not only drunk, but also disorderly. The \nperson must cause a disturbance or behave in such a way as to annoy others in the vicinity or people \nlikely to be there. This will depend on the circumstances of the case.\n\u2022 Dr unk and behaving in a riotous or disorderly manner \u2013 this is not only being drunk but acting in a \nparticular way. Riotous behaviour often involves a signi\ufb01cant breach of the peace. This o\ufb00ence is generally reserved for more serious cases of drunk and disorderly conduct.\nThe law prohibiting public drunkenness aims to control o\ufb00ensive and unruly behaviour on the streets, \nparticularly around licensed premises and at major sporting or other public events. The behaviour is only \nan o\ufb00ence if it occurs in a public place. \nWhile drunkenness on private property may not be an o\ufb00ence, police can still enter the property and \nintervene if they believe there is a disturbance or breach of the peace. Any unruly behaviour at a private property may therefore result in a person being charged with other o\ufb00ences like assault or property damage (but not the o\ufb00ence of being drunk in a public place).\nIn this topic we focus on being drunk in a public place as set out in Section 13 of the Summary O\ufb00ences Act. \nElements of public drunkenness \nSection 13 of the Summary O\ufb00ences Act states that, \u2018Any person found drunk in a public place shall be guilty of an o\ufb00ence.\u2019 Merely being \u2018drunk in public\u2019 is su\ufb03cient. No disruptive or disorderly conduct need occur.\nFor a person to be convicted of public drunkenness, the prosecution must prove the following elements:\n\u2022 the accused was drunk or appeared to be drunk\n\u2022 the accused was in a public place.\nElement 1 \u2013 The accused was drunk or appeared to be \ndrunk\nThe Summary O\ufb00ences Act does not de\ufb01ne what it means to be \u2018drunk\u2019 . This has been left to the courts to \ndetermine, based on what an ordinary person would think. Courts will consider the amount of alcohol \nconsumed and the person\u2019s behaviour, appearance and demeanour at the time.\nBeing drunk is more than being under the in\ufb02uence of alcohol or being \u2018tipsy\u2019 . It requires a substantial \nlack of capacity or control.\nPossible indicators of drunkenness include being:\n\u2022 unable to stand; for example, is stumbling or falling overpublic place \nan area or location considered open to the public (i.e. anyone in the community has a right to go there)\ndrunk \nwhen a person\u2019s physical or mental faculties or judgment are appreciably and materially impaired by alcohol, drugs or another substance, resulting in a substantial lack of capacity or control\npublic drunkenness \na general term used to describe a number of specific offences contained in Victoria\u2019s Summary Offences Act that relate to a person being drunk in a public place\ndecriminalisation \nthe process of legalising an act or behaviour which was previously considered a crime\n06_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   169 17/10/2017   1:40 PM",

It consists of a list of places \nwhich are, for the purposes of the Act, considered public spaces. \nThe list is both speci\ufb01c and broad in nature. For example, it speci\ufb01es that government schools, \nmarkets and licensed premises are public places. It also states that a public place is \u2018any place of public \nresort\u2019 and \u2018any open place to which the public whether upon or without payment for admittance have \nor are permitted to have access\u2019 . These broad descriptors in the de\ufb01nition of a public place mean a \npublic place can be any place which is, at the time, open and accessible to the public.\nWhen there is confusion or uncertainty as to whether a place \ufb01ts within the statutory de\ufb01nition of a \npublic place, it is left to the courts to decide. The courts have generally ruled that public places are \u2018every place to which the public [as the public] may at the relevant time go.

  "Page 183": "171  CHAPTER 6  SUMMAR Y OFFENCESWhether the courts consider an area a public place will depend on the context or circumstances of \nthe case, and may mean that an area is considered a public place on one occasion but not on another. For \nexample a shop is considered a public place during business hours but not at other times.\nThere have been several cases where the courts have considered whether a person in a private car \npositioned on a public road is \u2018in a public place\u2019 . The courts have ruled that if a motor vehicle is in a public place, then so are the vehicle\u2019s occupants. Despite this ruling, whether a vehicle is a public place will depend on the circumstances. For example, a court may not consider a caravan parked on a road with its blinds closed a public place. While courts will follow a decision from a previous case, they may not always do so when the circumstances, in the case to be decided, di\ufb00er from those in the previous case. \nThe following legal case highlights how being drunk in a car constitutes a public drunkenness o\ufb00ence.  \nPossible defences \nFailure to prove all elements will result in the accused being found not guilty of the crime, therefore the accused may try to argue that one of the elements is missing. For example, the accused may argue that:\n\u2022 the accused was not drunk\u2022 the accused was not in a public place.\nDrunkenness o\ufb00ences are crimes of strict liability. That means that the o\ufb00ender\u2019s mental state at \nthe time of the crime is, for the most part, irrelevant. Accused persons have little room to argue. It also \nmeans that there are few defences available other than contesting the o\ufb00ence on the basis that one of the elements of the crime cannot be proved.\nThe accused was not drunk\nIn some cases, a person may be accused of public drunkenness when they are not actually drunk. This can occur when a person is behaving in a certain manner (or displaying typical indicators of drunkenness).  For example, a person with a medical condition or physical disability might display what appear to be the physical characteristics of drunkenness, when in fact they are the symptoms of their condition, as outlined in the following case study.strict liability \nwhere culpability or responsibility for committing a crime can be established without having to prove there was mens rea (i.e. a guilty mind)Being drunk in a car in a public place\nMcKenzie v Stratton [1971] VR 848\nOn 24 October 1970, a drunken man refused to pay a taxi fare, so the driver took him to the police \nstation. The taxi was parked in a public carpark outside the police station. On approaching the car, a police officer saw the man sprawled in the front seat of the taxi. The man was arrested for being drunk and disorderly in a public place. In the Magistrates\u2019 Court, the prosecution argued that both the taxi and the carpark were public places. A magistrate dismissed the case on the basis that the taxi was not a public place as defined in the Summary Offences Act. The \nprosecution appealed this point of law in the Supreme Court of Victoria.\nThe Supreme Court referred to several earlier cases for guidance; particularly Walker v \nCrawshaw [1924] NZLR 93. In this case, a man found having sex in the backseat of a car parked \non a public street was convicted of wilfully engaging in a grossly indecent act in a public place.\nThe Supreme Court decided that the magistrate made an error in law because \u2018a person in \na motor vehicle on a public place is still in that public place\u2019.LEGAL\nCASE\n06_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   171 17/10/2017   1:41 PM",

Public drunkenness o\ufb00ences are now contained in statute law.\nThe courts have had a signi\ufb01cant role to play in explaining what is meant by the term \u2018drunk\u2019 , and \ninterpreting what is meant by the term \u2018public place\u2019 . This role continues today as the term \u2018drunk\u2019 is still de\ufb01ned in common law. \nStatute law\nThree public drunkenness o\ufb00ences are contained in the Summary O\ufb00ences Act, therefore a person will be charged under statute law if they are drunk in a public place. The Act also provides a de\ufb01nition of what is meant by the term \u2018public place\u2019 , though the courts still need to interpret the meaning of that term to decide on cases before them. \nMost Australian states decriminalised public drunkenness in response to the Report of the Royal \nCommission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in 1991. This report recommended that public drunkenness should be a public health or social welfare issue rather than a legal one. It recommended that drunken persons be placed in sobering up centres rather than police cells. This recommendation was in response to the high number of Aboriginal people, across Australia, who died in police custody after being arrested for drunkenness o\ufb00ences. The hope was that decriminalisation would see disadvantaged groups in society \nlike the homeless, the disabled and Indigenous Australians would receive medical and social support rather than being imprisoned unnecessarily. \nThe Victorian Parliament did not decriminalise public drunkenness in response \nto this report. Instead, it tried to redress the overrepresentation of Indigenous Victorians in the criminal justice system with strategies such as Aboriginal Justice Agreements, Koori Courts, Police Aboriginal Liaison O\ufb03cers and Aboriginal Community Justice Panels, and by tackling underlying issues in Indigenous housing, health, employment and education.\nFurther, the Victorian Parliament also chose not to act on the recommendation \nto decriminalise public drunkenness following a Victorian Law Reform Commission report in 1989\u201390 and the 2001 Victorian Parliament\u2019s Drugs and Crime Prevention Committee Inquiry into Public Drunkenness.\nIn considering these reports, the Parliament highlighted the fact that public \ndrunkenness cannot be easily separated from the big part that alcohol plays in Australian culture. It felt that decriminalisation would not be successful unless \nSource 1 Alcohol abuse in the homeless \nis a social issue highlighted in law reform \nrecommendations.Victorian Law Reform Commission (VLRC) Victoria\u2019s leading independent law reform organisation.

It recognised that alcohol abuse comes in di\ufb00erent forms; for \nexample, the homeless or itinerant drunk, the harmless drunk, youth binge drinking, drinking at special events, drinking at licensed venues and drinking in combination with drugs. \nTrends and statistics\nThe Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education (FARE) conducts a poll each year to gauge the level of alcohol consumption in Australia and community attitudes towards alcohol-related issues. In 2016, FARE reported the following \ufb01ndings:\n\u2022 the rate of alcohol consumption in Australia remains unchanged\u2022 78 per cent of adults surveyed said they drink alcohol\u2022 37 per cent of those surveyed indicated that they drink to get drunk\u2022 12 per cent of the drinkers surveyed drink to get drunk at least once a week\u2022 78 per cent of the people surveyed believe Australia has a problem with excessive drinking and thought \nmore needed to be done to reduce the harm caused by alcohol\n\u2022 29 per cent of those surveyed have been a\ufb00ected by alcohol-related violence.\nVictoria\nIn 2007, The Age newspaper estimated that 13 500 Victorians (260 per week) were charged with public \ndrunkenness. Estimating the number of people charged with this o\ufb00ence is di\ufb03cult because these incidents are currently counted under the broader category of disorderly and o\ufb00ensive conduct together with \ufb01ve other o\ufb00ences.\nCourt data does not show the true extent of the crime because the police generally give the o\ufb00ender \nan infringement notice (\ufb01ne) which, if paid, eliminates the need to go to court. Nonetheless, Sentencing Advisory Council statistics show that between 2013 and 2016, the Magistrates\u2019 Court dealt with 3 645 \u2018drunk in a public place\u2019 charges. Of those charges, 60 per cent were dismissed, 25 per cent were dealt with by \ufb01ne, and 2.6 per cent resulted in imprisonment.\nQueensland\nIn Queensland, more than 12 000 charges are laid each year in relation to public drunkenness. Like Victoria, \nhowever, the true extent of public drunkenness is not known. In Queensland, it is possible for a formal caution or no action to be taken at all if police o\ufb03cers notice a person drunk in a public place. Therefore, any statistics available are unlikely to reveal whether the crime is increasing or decreasing.\nPossible impacts of public drunkenness \nExcessive drinking in our community has a number of impacts. Some drunk people are anti-social, violent and abusive. They cause problems in licensed venues or entertainment districts and disturb the public order. Alcohol-fuelled violence can ruin people\u2019s lives; particularly when it results in death, serious injury, sexual assault, motor vehicle collisions, family violence and child abuse. Alcohol abuse may also result in property damage.\nPublic drunkenness has hidden costs. Members of the public do not feel safe \non the streets and police resources are diverted to deal with drunk and disorderly people. Medical and emergency services workers are subject to abusive and violent behaviour and hospitals or police cells become overcrowded. Sometimes, a person\u2019s medical condition or mental health issue is masked by their drunkenness, \nSource 2 Drunken behaviour may lead to \nviolence that ties up emergency services in \nthe community.Sentencing Advisory Council  an independent statutory body that provides statistics on sentencing in Victoria, conducts research, seeks public opinion and advises the Victorian Government on sentencing matters\n06_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   174 17/10/2017   1:41 PM",

In this case the woman\u2019s actions \nwere  not seen an exercise of her political rights and were  deemed o\ufb00ensive.\nWhere the conduct is obviously \u2018political\u2019 , the reasonable person test applies (what would a reasonable \nperson in the same position think of the behaviour). \nDefence 2 \u2013 Mental impairment\nA person will not be convicted of o\ufb00ensive behaviour if,  at the time of the o\ufb00ence, they were  su\ufb00ering \nfrom a mental illness (or disease of the mind) and, as a result, they:\n\u2022 did not know what they were  doing because they had little understanding of the nature and quality of  \ntheir actions \n\u2022 did not know their conduct was  wrong or could not reason, or think about, their conduct like an \nordinary person.\nA successful defence of mental impairment does not immediately result in the accused being released \nfrom custody. That  is, the verdict is not an ordinary \u2018not guilty\u2019 verdict. Instead, it is a special verdict of \u2018not \nguilty by  reason of mental impairment\u2019 . \nDefence 3 \u2013 Sudden or extraordinary emergency\nA person will not be convicted of o\ufb00ensive behaviour if they act as a result of a sudden or extraordinary \nemergency.  The  person must reasonably believe that:\n\u2022 there is a sudden or extraordinary emergency\n\u2022 their actions are  the only reasonable way  of dealing with the situation\n\u2022 their actions are  a reasonable response to  the situation.\nThe court will consider the gravity of the emergency, whether the person\u2019s actions were  the only way  \nof dealing with the situation, and whether they were  reasonable in the circumstances. Something \u2018offensive or disgusting\u2019 can be \u2018obscene\u2019\nFraser v Walker [2015] VCC  1911 (19 November 2015)\nOn 5  August 2014, Michelle Fraser protested outside a  Melbourne fertility clinic and was  \ncharged with displaying an obscene figure in a  public place. The woman displayed posters of \nbloodied, aborted foetuses while standing on a  public footpath. Police attended the protest \nfollowing complaints from patients at  the clinic. The woman was  convicted in  the Magistrates\u2019 \nCourt and fined $600.\nThe woman appealed her conviction in the County Court of Victoria on the grounds that the \nimages were  not obscene; nor did they contravene current community standards. The woman \nalso argued that being charged with an offence was  contrary to  her human rights because she \nwas exercising her right to  political protest at the time of the alleged offence.\nIn dismissing the appeal  the judge said that the word  \u2018obscene\u2019 may  relate to  \u2018offensive \nor disgusting\u2019 representations and is not confined to  images of a  sexual nature. He did not \nconsider her protest a  political one as it  targeted patients and workers at  the clinic rather than \ngovernment representatives.LEGAL\nCASE\nappeal   \nan application to  \nhave a higher court \nreview a ruling (i.e. decision) made by a lower  court\n06_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   179 17/10/2017   1:41 PM",

While not technically a defence, the involuntary nature of the accused\u2019s actions may mean that a guilty mind (mens rea) cannot be proved. This may see the accused acquitted of the o\ufb00ence charged or found guilty of a lesser o\ufb00ence.\nFor an o\ufb00ensive behaviour charge, the accused may state that their \nactions were involuntary due to:\n\u2022 automatism \n\u2022 accident.\nAutomatism\nAutomatism can be relied on where a person has a total loss of control over their \nbodily movements. Because they have completely lost control, it is accepted that they cannot form the intention to commit a crime, since they are not conscious or aware of what they are doing. Therefore, the action is considered to be involuntary. \nIt is not enough to say \u2018I didn\u2019t know what I was doing\u2019 . Some external factor \nhad to be the sole cause of the actions. A person may be found not guilty of an o\ufb00ence if they committed the crime:\n\u2022 while sleeping or sleepwalking\u2022 while su\ufb00ering concussion\u2022 during an epileptic seizure\u2022 as a result of a medical condition or because of a side e\ufb00ect of the proper \nuse of medication.\nAutomatism does not mean the person has a mental illness. Rather, the \nperson is in a zombie-like state and \u2018out of it\u2019 mentally, but capable of physical acts. For this reason it is sometimes called \u2018sane automatism\u2019 to distinguish it from \u2018insane automatism\u2019 , which is also involuntary, but results from a mental illness. \nAutomatism is a defence that is extremely rare and di\ufb03cult to prove.\nThe following example further outlines an instance where the defence of \ninvoluntary actions can be used to defend o\ufb00ensive behaviour.automatism \na state in which a person has a total loss of control over their bodily movements (i.e. is not conscious or aware of what they are doing), so that they cannot form an intention to commit a crime\nInvoluntary act\nPeople who suffer Tourette syndrome have a neurological disorder that manifests itself in \ninvoluntary behaviours \u2013 including physical and vocal tics.

In doing so, judges consider the facts of the case, the context in which the crime was committed, the legislation under which the o\ufb00ender is charged and current social standards. \nIn the case of Worcester v Smith [1951] VLR 316, the judge commented that for behaviour to be \no\ufb00ensive it \u2018must be calculated to wound the feelings or arouse anger, resentment, disgust, or outrage in the mind of a reasonable person\u2019 . \nIn Monis v The Queen (2013) 249 CLR 92, the High Court commented that the de\ufb01nition of obscenity \nmust keep pace with current social standards. These standards are determined by considering whether a reasonable person would consider the behaviour \u2018obscene\u2019 in the given circumstances.\nMonis v The Queen (2013) 249 CLR 92 \n\u2018Both \u201cindecent\u201d and \u201cobscene\u201d \u2026 convey one idea, that of offending against recognised standards of propriety \u2013 indecent being at the lower end of the scale and obscene at the upper end \u2026 Criminal law provisions concerned with obscenity fall into a category of laws which must necessarily keep pace with prevailing views of society and changing circumstances \u2026 The application of a societal standard may be seen in the use \u2026 of the objective standard of the reasonable person.\u2019EXTRACT\nStatute law\nThe provisions in the Summary O\ufb00ences Act in relation to o\ufb00ensive behaviour have been left unchanged for more than 50 years.\nThere is little general agreement on what constitutes o\ufb00ensive behaviour so, in the absence of a \nprecise statutory de\ufb01nition, it is left to the discretion of police and then to the judgment of the courts to determine what is and what is not \u2018o\ufb00ensive\u2019 based on current social standards.\nTo decide whether behaviour is o\ufb00ensive, obscene, indecent and insulting, a judge may need to \ufb01rst \ndetermine the word\u2019s natural and ordinary meaning and then determine whether a reasonable person would consider the behaviour o\ufb00ensive given the context in which the behaviour occurred.\nIn determining the meaning of words, such as obscene, indecent and insulting, judges may refer to the \nordinary English de\ufb01nition of these words and they may also look to past cases for guidance. \n06_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   182 17/10/2017   1:41 PM",

This \nyear\u2019s Triple J  Hottest 100 countdown featured the word  \u2018f---\u2019 82 times in 32 songs. And a  \nbedtime storybook urges children to  \u2018Go the F--- to  Sleep!\u2019. So, should uttering the f-word in \npublic be a crime? And what about the c-word?\nIn Australia, swearing is ubiquitous. Yet each year, thousands of Australians incur fines or \ncriminal convictions for  swearing. The use of  offensive, indecent or  obscene language in  public \nis punishable in all Australian states  and territories. Police typically punish people for  saying \nthe words \u2018f---\u2019 and/or \u2018c---\u2019 in their presence \n\u2026 It is up to  the individual police officer (when issuing an  infringement notice) or  magistrate \n(when hearing an offensive language charge) to  determine community standards on offensive \nlanguage. In  doing so, decision-makers draw on  their \u2018common sense\u2019 and everyday  experience. \nUnsurprisingly, judicial opinions differ when assessing community standards.\nIn 2007, for  instance, a  Western Australian Supreme Court judge said that language which \nchallenges police authority is  likely to be  criminally offensive. More recently, magistrates have \nheld that the word  \u2018prick\u2019 used to  describe a  police officer, and the expression \u2018f--- Fred  Nile\u2019 \nexclaimed at an anti-marriage equality rally, were not criminally offensive.\nIs pop culture having an impact on attitudes to  swearing in the courtroom? The answer is \nyes. In  the 2003 New  South Wales Local Court case Police v  Butler, Magistrate Heilpern referred \nto the prevalence of the f-word word  on Triple J  and its  frequent occurrence on television \nshows The Sopranos and Sex and the City. He found the defendant not guilty of using offensive \nlanguage, stating: \u2018The word  f--- is  extremely commonplace now  and has lost  much of its  punch.\u2019 \nAlthough only a  Local Court judgment (therefore of  limited precedential value), the magistrate\u2019s \nassessment of community standards has influenced the criminal law on offensive language.IN \nTHE \nNEWS\nTrends and statistics\nO\ufb00ensive behaviour is a public order o\ufb00ence. As such, it is categorised for  statistical purposes with \ufb01ve  \nother public order o\ufb00ences under the category of \u2018disorderly and o\ufb00ensive conduct\u2019 .

The City of Melbourne, in particular, has become internationally famous for the street art in its laneways. Many tourists view this \u2018art\u2019 on a daily basis. However, some say it attracts international gra\ufb03ti artists, who come to the city on a \u2018spraycation\u2019 . These \u2018\ufb02y in and out\u2019 gra\ufb03tists are di\ufb03cult to catch.\nThe Gra\ufb03ti Prevention Act 2007 (Vic) outlines several gra\ufb03ti o\ufb00ences, which are summary o\ufb00ences. \nThe purpose of the Act is to stop people from marking gra\ufb03ti and to control the possession and sale \nof aerosol paint. The Act gives police additional search powers so they can apprehend o\ufb00enders and seize gra\ufb03ti-related items.

It comes from the Italian word graffiti, plural of graffito, a scribbling, from graffiare, to scribble. In 1877 the sense was extended to mean any crude drawings and scribbling done in public places.

If the damage or marks cannot be removed easily it is considered gra\ufb03ti. Stencil art and engraving can also be considered as marking gra\ufb03ti.\nGra\ufb03ti artists often want their tags and pieces to be seen by others. They tend to mark gra\ufb03ti either \nin a public place or nearby. The crime of marking gra\ufb03ti can occur if the gra\ufb03ti is done in a public place or any place where it can be seen from a public place.\nA public place is de\ufb01ned in the Summary O\ufb00ences Act. It includes places like the street, sporting \ngrounds, shopping centres, railway stations and government schools, and any place that is open to the public. Courts have de\ufb01ned \u2018a public place\u2019 to be anywhere where the ordinary person would think the public has a right to go.\nElement 2 \u2013 The accused did so without the owner\u2019s \nconsent\nThe o\ufb00ence can only be committed if no express consent has been given by the property owner. Given \nmany public places in Victoria are owned by the State of Victoria, then express consent must be given by the state (through a person who is authorised to give that consent). A lack of consent will mean the marking is illegal. \nPossible defences to graffiti offences\nFailure to prove all elements will result in the accused being found not guilty of the crime, therefore the accused may try to argue that one of the elements is missing. For example, the accused may argue that: \n\u2022 the accused had the property owner\u2019s permission\u2022 the gra\ufb03ti could be removed with a dry cloth\u2022 the gra\ufb03ti is not visible from a public place.The statutory definition \nof a \u2018public place\u2019 under the Summary Offences Act is provided in topic 6.4 - Public drunkenness.Study tip\n06_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   187 17/10/2017   1:41 PM",
  "Page 200": "188  UNIT  1 GUIL T AND LIABILITYThe o\ufb00ence of marking gra\ufb03ti in the Gra\ufb03ti Prevention Act  is a crime of  strict liability. That  means \nthat the o\ufb00ender\u2019s mental state at  the time of the crime is,  for the most part, irrelevant. Accused persons \nhave  little room to  argue. It also means that there are  few defences available other than contesting the \no\ufb00ence on the basis that one of the elements of the crime cannot be proved.\nIn very rare  circumstances a person could argue that their actions were  due to  mental impairment, \nduress or an honest and reasonable mistake.\nDefence 1 \u2013 Mental impairment\nA person will not be convicted of a gra\ufb03ti o\ufb00ence if,  at the time of the o\ufb00ence, they were  su\ufb00ering from \na mental illness (or disease of the mind) and, as a result, they:\n\u2022 did not know what they were  doing because they had little understanding of the nature and quality of  \ntheir actions \n\u2022 did not know their conduct was  wrong or could not reason, or think about, their conduct like an \nordinary person.A successful defence of mental impairment does not immediately result in the accused being released \nfrom custody. That  is, the verdict is not an ordinary \u2018not guilty\u2019 verdict. Instead, it is a special verdict of  \n\u2018not guilty by  reason of mental impairment\u2019 . This means the accused can still be kept  in custody, but it will \nbe under medical supervision.\nDefence 2 \u2013 Duress\nA person will not be convicted of a gra\ufb03ti o\ufb00ence if they act under duress. The  defence of duress \napplies if,  at the time of the o\ufb00ence:\n\u2022 the person has a reasonable belief that:\n\u2022 a threat of harm exists\u2022 the threat would be carried out unless the o\ufb00ence was  committed\n\u2022 committing an o\ufb00ence is the only reasonable way  to avoid threatened harm\n\u2022 the person\u2019s conduct is a reasonable response to  the threat.\nDefence 3 \u2013 Honest and reasonable mistake\nA person will not be convicted of  a gra\ufb03ti o\ufb00ence if they can prove  that they made both an honest and a  \nreasonable mistake of fact (not law). This could apply if  a person charged with marking gra\ufb03ti genuinely  \nbelieved they had the property owner\u2019s permission when in fact they did not. The  belief must als o be  \nreasonable. That  is, would an ordinary person in similar circumstances have  held the same belief? It is  \nimportant to  show that if the facts (as the accused believed them) were  true, then the accused would not  \nhave committed an o\ufb00ence.  \nThe following case study is an example of gra\ufb03ti conduct which resulted in serious charges.strict liability \nwhere culpability or responsibility for committing a crime can be established without having to  prove  there \nwas mens rea (i.e. a \nguilty mind)\nduress \nstrong mental pressure on someone to overcome their \nindependent will and force  them to  do \nsomething\nreasonable belief  \nan honestly held opinion about the way  things \nare, which would seem to another ordinary \nperson with similar characteristics (e.g. age or maturity), in similar circumstances, to  be \nsensible or correct\nPolitical  prank  ends  in prison\nIn March 2003, two  34-year-old men were  sentenced to  nine months in  prison and ordered to pay  \n$151 000 in  compensation for  writing \u2018No War\u2019, in red  paint, on  the top of  the Sydney  Opera House.  \nThe incident \u2013  designed to  protest the Australian Government\u2019s decision to  become involved in  \nthe Iraq War \u2013 resulted in a $9 million dollar security upgrade for the Opera House precinct.\nThe men were  charged with malicious (criminal) damage.

It is in any event a crime that is contained in statute law and not in common law. However, the courts still have a role to play in deciding whether a crime has been committed within the meaning of the statute, including deciding what is a \u2018public place\u2019. \nStatute law\nThe o\ufb00ence of marking gra\ufb03ti originates in statute law. In 2007, the Victorian Parliament passed the Gra\ufb03ti Prevention Act  to quell community concern about unsightly gra\ufb03ti \u2018tags\u2019 and \u2018pieces\u2019 near \nrailway lines and on the walls and fences of private properties.\nThe Act made it clear that unwanted or o\ufb00ensive gra\ufb03ti is a crime, not art, and punishable by \na maximum of two years in prison. Unlike wilful damage to property and criminal damage which require proof of the o\ufb00ender\u2019s intent, the o\ufb00ence of marking gra\ufb03ti is a crime of strict liability making it easier for police to prosecute o\ufb00enders. To help the police catch o\ufb00enders, the Act gives them the authority to search a person, 14 years or over, without warrant if the police reasonably suspect that the person is carrying a spray paint can on or near public transport property or anywhere else as a trespasser. Any vehicle, bag or thing the person has with them can also be searched. Police can seize any gra\ufb03ti items found. This often occurs if the person is in an area recently marked with gra\ufb03ti or known for high levels of gra\ufb03ti.\nThe Act also gives local councils permission to enter private property to remove or cover gra\ufb03ti \nvisible from a public place. Councils are required to seek the property owner\u2019s permission before taking action.\nTrends and statistics\nGra\ufb03ti is an underreported crime. Many o\ufb00enders are hard to catch. Gra\ufb03ti gangs take their work seriously, plan their operations carefully and work as a team to avoid detection. Gra\ufb03ti artists often work at night, in secluded places and dress so they can\u2019t be identi\ufb01ed. Some victims may remove the gra\ufb03ti, thinking it is too trivial to report to police, or they may report it to their local council instead. For these reasons, and because some incidents are prosecuted as general property crime rather than a gra\ufb03ti o\ufb00ence, crime statistics may not accurately re\ufb02ect the extent of gra\ufb03ti-related crime in the community.\n06_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   190 17/10/2017   1:41 PM",

Of these, \ncriminal damage is by far the most prevalent.\nNew South Wales \nThe New South Wales Department of Justice gra\ufb03ti facts and \ufb01gures for 2011\u201316 indicate that:\n\u2022 Pr operty types targeted by gra\ufb03tists were residential premises (26.8 per cent), public transport property \n(19.7 per cent), business premises (18.6 per cent) and public places (15.3 per cent).\n\u2022 An average of 8063 (108 per 100 000 population) gra\ufb03ti o\ufb00ences were reported to police per year. \nThis is signi\ufb01cantly higher than in Victoria where the average is 3402 incidents (58.4 per 100 000 \npopulation). \n\u2022 At the same time, there was an average 7.5 per cent decrease in incidents reported to New South Wales police and a 3 per cent decrease in Victoria. This decrease may be due to a range of factors aimed at deterring gra\ufb03tists including tougher laws, anti-gra\ufb03ti education programs, legal street art or walls, rapid removal and the use of anti-gra\ufb03ti surfaces in public places.

  "Page 204": "192  UNIT  1 GUILT AND LIABILITYPossible impacts of graffiti-related crimes \nLots of gra\ufb03ti in a neighbourhood lowers the quality of the urban landscape and impacts on people\u2019s \nperception of law and order. While some see it as a harmless activity, gra\ufb03ti-ridden public places and streets signals a degree of lawlessness and make others feel unsafe. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates that one in \ufb01ve people think that gra\ufb03ti in an area is an indicator of social disorder.\nBy the twenty-\ufb01rst century, the gra\ufb03ti problem in Australian towns and cities became an important \nissue for law enforcement, local government and the community. Gra\ufb03ti removal and prevention remains a major issue for government organisations and private companies. The cost of removing gra\ufb03ti from public and private property is huge and diverts \ufb01nancial and human resources from other projects. \nMost local councils have gra\ufb03ti management plans. They spend substantial amounts of money in \ngra\ufb03ti removal and prevention. In 2016, it was estimated that the City of Melbourne spent $800 000 removing or painting over gra\ufb03ti in the city. The estimated cost for removing gra\ufb03ti from Metropolitan \ntrains is $10 million per year, while the cost to VicRoads to remove gra\ufb03ti from road signs, tra\ufb03c lights and signal boxes is $380 000 per year. The hidden costs of preventative measures, like increased lighting, \nvideo surveillance, employing security guards and installing gra\ufb03ti-resistant surfaces, are not included in these estimates.\nFor private property owners, a gra\ufb03ti attack is annoying and expensive to remove. It leaves victims \nangry. Unsightly gra\ufb03ti on a property or in a neighbourhood can impact on property prices and people generally feel unsafe in areas with a high incidence of gra\ufb03ti.\nWriting gra\ufb03ti can also be a dangerous activity. Some gra\ufb03ti artists will risk their lives to paint their \n\u2018tag\u2019 or \u2018piece\u2019 in a highly visible or inaccessible place. They may \u2018surf\u2019 trains, climb billboards, hang from buildings or bridges or stand beside railway tracks and freeways. Some have fallen from or been hit by moving trains. Others have been electrocuted when they touched high-voltage overhead electrical wires. Gra\ufb03ti artists not only expose themselves to serious injury but also to serious criminal charges; particularly if their activity is widespread, causes extensive damage or involves the commission of other crimes.\nSource 2 Graffiti removal is a costly business for local councils \naround Australia.Source 3 Graffiti is a dangerous and risky pastime.\n06_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   192 17/10/2017   1:41 PM",

  "Page 210": "198PURPOSES AND TYPES OF CIVIL/uni00A0LAW 7.1 \nSome of the laws made by parliament and \nthe courts are known as \u2018civil law\u2019 . Civil law regulates disputes between individuals, groups and organisations. It enables people to enforce their rights where harm has occurred. \n\u2018Civil liabilities\u2019 is a term used to describe the \nlegal responsibilities of a party (i.e. an individual, group or organisation) for any loss or harm caused to another party because of a breach of civil law. In this topic, you will explore the purposes and types of civil law.\nPurposes of/uni00A0civil/uni00A0law\nCivil law has several speci\ufb01c purposes. It aims/uni00A0to:\n\u2022 achieve social cohesion \u2013 For example, civil law provides guidelines for acceptable behaviour, so \nthat individuals can live together in harmony. If those guidelines did not exist, some individuals might \nexploit or abuse the rights of others. For example, if there was no law regulating the standard and quality of toys, toy manufacturers might make toys using the cheapest materials without concern for the safety of the children playing with them. Similarly, there are laws requiring schools and businesses that provide childcare to make sure they maintain processes and procedures to protect children within their/uni00A0care\n\u2022 pr otect the rights of individuals \u2013 For example, the right to be protected from false statements that \nmight damage your reputation, the right to a promise made under a contract, and a right not to be harmed\n\u2022 provide an avenue for people to seek compensation where a breach of civil law has occurred \n\u2013 For example, through the courts, tribunals, complaints bodies and ombudsmen (you will explore these dispute resolution bodies in Unit 2). If there were no dispute resolution bodies, no specialised bodies would be available to help people resolve their disputes, so disagreement would fester in the community. This would impact on social cohesion\n\u2022 provide a means to seek compensation \u2013 For example, when a person\u2019s rights have been infringed, \ncivil law provides a way to return the person harmed, as far as possible, to the position they were in before the harm occurred. This is done through the awarding of civil remedies, the most common of which is damages (i.e. an amount of money as compensation) payable to the plainti\ufb00 for loss \nsu\ufb00ered. \nCertain types of civil law also have speci\ufb01c purposes. For example:\n\u2022 Contr act law aims to ensure that people who make promises under a contract (agreement) stick to \nthose promises, or else compensate the other party to the contract if they fail to comply with it. \n\u2022 La ws relating to negligence aim to ensure that people who owe reasonable duties of care to each \nother do not breach those duties. If they do, they are responsible for any loss su\ufb00ered as a result. \n\u2022 La ws relating to wills aim to provide a consistent set of rules about the way a person\u2019s will (instructions \nabout how to deal with their property after they die) must be carried out. If a deceased person didn\u2019t \nleave a will, statute law sets out the way this must be done to provide a fair and equitable distribution of assets.civil law \nan area of law that defines the rights and responsibilities of individuals, groups and organisations in society and regulates private disputes (as opposed to criminal law)\nremedy  \na term used to describe any order made by a court designed to address a civil wrong or breach.

  "Page 211": "199  CHAPTER  7 CIVIL LIABILIT YHow  civil law achieves its purposes\nThe civil system works in three related ways  to achieve its purpose./uni00A0It:\n\u2022 establishes the law  \u2013 For  example, through statutes made by  parliament and through court decisions. \nA large body of civil law  has been developed by  the courts over  time. However, parliament has also \npassed statutes which establish many civil law  principles\n\u2022 decides the law  \u2013 For  example, by  ruling on which party\u2019s claim is correct. In Australia there are  \ncourts and other dispute resolution bodies, such as tribunals and complaints bodies, which provide \nservices to  parties in a dispute to  resolve that dispute\n\u2022 enforces the law  \u2013 For  example, by  giving parties mechanisms to  enforce any  remedies they receive \n(e.g. regularly taking a portion of a person\u2019s wages  to satisfy an order that they pay  damages).\nTypes of/uni00A0civil/uni00A0law\nThere are  a number of types of civil/uni00A0law. These include:\n\u2022 Negligence \u2013 This occurs when someone owes  a duty of  care  to another and breaches that duty, \ncausing harm or loss to  another person (e.g. a doctor is careless during a medical procedure, and \nsomething goes wrong, causing physical injury and pain to  the patient).\n\u2022 Trespass \u2013 This occurs when someone interferes with another person, their land or their goods, and that interference causes damage (e.g. destroying another person\u2019s car may  give  rise to  a claim for  \ntrespass to  goods). \n\u2022 Defamation \u2013 This relates to  the publication of material which causes damage to  another person\u2019s \nreputation. For  example, publication of a statement about another person, in a newspaper article or \non social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, that is false and harmful to  that person\u2019s \nreputation may  lead to  a claim by  the other person.trespass  \na type of tort involving interference or intrusion of a person\u2019s body, property or goods without the consent of that personA trip to  the fish and chip shop \nends at the Supreme Court\nClarke v Greater Shepparton City Council \n[2016] VSC 542 (8 September/uni00A02016)\nOn the evening of 14  September 2008, Steven  Graham Clarke \ntripped on a  stormwater pit in a  reserve in Shepparton on \nhis way to  a fish and chip shop. He fell and was  injured. \nClarke sued the Greater Shepparton City Council, claiming \nthat the Council breached its  duties, because it was  the \nbody responsible for  the management and control of the \nreserve and the/uni00A0stormwater pit.\nJustice Keogh of the Supreme Court awarded damages of $359 303 to  the plaintiff, which \nincluded an amount for past and future medical expenses, and past and future care.  LEGAL\nCASE\nSource 2 In the case of Clarke v Greater \nShepparton City Council, a trip to  a fish \nand chip shop ended in a trip to  the \nSupreme Court of Victoria. \nIn 1972, a plaintiff who owned a house near a golf course was successful in \na private nuisance claim, because over  a \nperiod of several years golf balls struck her property frequently. Did you know?\u2022 L aws relating to  nuisance  recognise  that people  should have  a right to  enjoy  and use their  land,  \nor public  land,  free  from  interferences  or annoyance.  Their  purpose  is to ensure  that people  can \nenjoy  this right, by  establishing  guidelines  on what counts  as an interference  or annoyance.  \n\u2022 L aws relating to  defamation  aim to ensure  that a person\u2019s  reputation  is not harmed  because of \nfalse  statements that are  made  about  that person.  \nThe following legal case is an example of a civil dispute.nuisance  a type of tort which involves interference with a person\u2019s right to  \nuse and enjoy property\ndefamation \na type of tort which involves the action of damaging a person\u2019s personal or professional reputation in the community through the communication of false and untrue statements or information\n07_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   199 17/10/2017   1:42 PM",
  "Page 212": "200  UNIT  1 GUIL T AND LIABILITY\u2022 Nuisance laws  \u2013 These deal with the use and enjoyment of people\u2019s property (both public and \nprivate property). A nuisance claim may  be made by  a person who is unable to  enjoy their own  home \nbecause of some sort of interference (e.g. a signi\ufb01cant odour coming from a factory nearby). \n\u2022 Wills and inheritance laws  \u2013 These regulate wills, including when they are  valid. They  give guidelines \nabout the decisions made by  a will-maker and how  a person\u2019s estate is distributed if there is no/uni00A0will.\n\u2022 Contract law  \u2013 This covers the validity of contracts (legal agreements) and the rights available to  a \nperson if a valid contract has been breached. A/uni00A0claim for  breach of contract may  involve  a contracting \nparty who has failed to  do something, or has done something contrary to  what they have  agreed to  do \nas part of a contract. Many statutes regulate issues that may  arise in contracts, such as unfair terms \nand guarantees (given by  a seller when they sell goods).\n\u2022 Family law  \u2013 This deals with disputes between family members and which are  of a family nature, \nsuch as disputes over  the division of property between divorced parties and the parenting of children, \nas illustrated in the example below.\nSam and/uni00A0Alice\nSam and Alice\u2019s parents separated in July 2016. A/uni00A0 month later, their mother commenced \nproceedings in the Family Court of Australia seeking orders from the Court in relation to  custody \nof Sam and Alice. The Family Court made orders on December 2016 that the children should live with the mother, but that the children are  to spend time with their father every  second weekend, \nand each alternate week during the school holidays. EXAMPLE\nGather newspaper \narticles and social media references to  these \ndifferent types of civil law. Make note of the different legal terms used for each type of civil law. For example, in negligence claims you will see the words \u2018duty of care\u2019, whereas in will disputes you will see the words \n\u2018executor\u2019 and \u2018estate\u2019. Learn these legal terms and definitions and use them correctly to  improve \nyour performance in assessment tasks.Study tip\u2022 Employment laws  \u2013 These deal with disputes between \nemployers and employees. Disputes often arise in the \nworkplace in relation to  pay,  conditions, harassment, \ndiscrimination and termination of employment.\n\u2022 Equal opportunity and discrimination laws  \u2013 \nThese aim to  protect individuals from bias, prejudice or \nvili\ufb01cation based on a personal attribute such as their sex, marital status, race or religion.\nAs part of this Area of Study, you  will examine two  areas \nof civil law.

  "Page 214": "202KEY CONCEPTS OF CIVIL/uni00A0LAW 7.2 \nIf there has been a breach of civil law, the person whose rights have been infringed is referred to as either \nthe aggrieved party, the wronged party or the plainti\ufb00 (in court). The party alleged to be in the wrong is referred to as the wrongdoer or the defendant (in court).\nThe plainti\ufb00 may use a dispute resolution body such as a court or a tribunal to sue the defendant in \nan attempt to obtain a remedy to compensate them for the loss su\ufb00ered.\nA number of key concepts of civil law are relevant when a party sues another party. Those concepts \ninclude breach, causation, loss, limitation of actions, the burden of proof and the standard of proof. Each concept will be discussed in detail in this topic.\nBreach\nIn most types of civil claims, one of the key elements in a case that the plainti\ufb00 will have to prove is that there has been a breach by the defendant. This means that the defendant has in some way failed \nto observe a law or obligation imposed on him or her. As the plainti\ufb00 has the responsibility or onus to prove their case, they need to establish that the defendant is in breach. The defendant may argue as a defence that there has been no breach. \nThe nature of the breach depends on the area of law. For example:\n\u2022 In contract law, the plainti\ufb00 may allege that the defendant has breached an agreement that was \nreached between them. In other words, the defendant has failed to ful\ufb01l an obligation or promise that he or she made to the plainti\ufb00. For example, if a person hires a jumping castle for a birthday party, a contract will be formed with the supplier governing the supply of that castle. One of the terms of the supply may be that the castle is to be set up at the person\u2019s house by 11.00 am, in time for the party. If the supplier fails to complete the installation by that time, or if the castle never arrives, there will have been a breach of contract. \nThe following example provides another possible breach of contract law.\nContract to provide editing services\nSally runs her own editing business from home. Two months ago she was contracted by a small \naccounting firm to edit various reports that they were preparing for their clients. Sally and the accounting firm agreed that she would be paid a flat fee of $2000 per report, and that she would review six reports in total. Sally completed the job on time, and issued an invoice for $12 000. The accounting firm has only paid $6000 of the invoice, and now says that the agreed rate was $1000 per report. EXAMPLE\n\u2022 In negligence, a plainti\ufb00 may allege that the defendant breached his or her duty of care to the plainti\ufb00. This means that the defendant had an obligation or duty to care for the plainti\ufb00, and that duty was not complied/uni00A0with. For example, in schools, teachers often have obligations to supervise the grounds before, during and after school hours. If a school fails to roster teachers to supervise a \n UNIT  1 GUILT AND LIABILITYdefendant  \n(in a civil case) a party who is alleged to have breached a civil law and who is being sued by a plaintiff\nsue \nto take civil action against another person, claiming that they infringed some legal right of the plaintiff (or did some legal wrong that negatively affected the plaintiff)\nburden of proof  \nthe obligation (i.e. \nresponsibility) of a party to prove a case.

  "Page 215": "203  CHAPTER  7 CIVIL LIABILIT YCausation\nAnother  key element  that the  plainti\ufb00  will normally  need  to prove  in a case  is causation . The  plainti\ufb00  \nwill need  to prove  that the  actions  of the  defendant  caused  or resulted  in the harm  su\ufb00ered  by the \nplainti\ufb00,  and that the  harm  would  not have  occurred  if not for the actions  of the  defendant.  That is,  \nthere  needs  to be a causal  link  between  the actions  (or inactions)  of the  defendant, and  the harm  that \nthe plainti\ufb00  su\ufb00ered.\nFor example,  imagine  if a plainti\ufb00  alleges  that the  defendant  has been  playing  loud  music  all night \nlong for several  weeks  and  months. The  plainti\ufb00  may  be able  to bring a nuisance  claim  against  \nthe defendant,  alleging  that the  defendant  has disturbed  his or her enjoyment  of property . If the \nplainti\ufb00  alleges  that he  or she  no longer  sleeps  at night,  is su\ufb00ering  from  anxiety,  and has lost his or \nher job, the plainti\ufb00  will need  to establish  that the  defendant\u2019s  actions  caused all  of those  things,  and \nthose  things  were not  caused by  something  else.  For example,  is the plainti\ufb00 not  sleeping  for another  \nreason  like a health  condition?  Or did the plainti\ufb00  lose  his or her  job not because she  can\u2019t  sleep  and \nconcentrate  because of the  defendant\u2019s  actions,  but because he  or she  is not very  good  in performing  \ntheir  duties  at/uni00A0work?causation \nthe direct relationship between one event (i.e. Event 1) and another event  (i.e. Event 2), \nwhere Event 1 was the reason Event 2 happened, and Event 2 would not have happened by itself, without Event 1Junpeng Tan:/uni00A0Mother suing camp operator, Victorian \nGovernment after son dies on school excursion\nPatrick Wright, ABC, 12 December/uni00A02016\nThe mother of a  seven-year-old boy  who died on an excursion in Melbourne's outer east is \nsuing the Victorian Government and a camp operator.\nJunpeng Tan  suffered a  cardiac arrest on a  trip to  the Belgrave Recreational \nReserve with grade one classmates in October/uni00A0 2013.

If a school chooses not to  enrol students because of their race \nor religion, it is likely to  be a breach of that law.\nThe article below provides an example of an allegation of breach of duty of  care.\n07_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   203 17/10/2017   1:42 PM",

This happens when something \noccurs after the defendant\u2019s actions which may  be seen to  have  actually caused the injury or loss, rather \nthan the defendant\u2019s actions. In a negligence case,  the plainti\ufb00 will claim that the defendant breached a \nduty of  care  towards  the plainti\ufb00. For  example, if Bill injures Babak in a \ufb01ght, Babak might have  a civil \nclaim against Bill. But what happens if Babak went into surgery for  his injuries, and the surgeon made \nthe loss su\ufb00ered by  Babak worse? Did Bill cause the loss, or did the surgeon? It could be argued that the \nsurgeon\u2019s actions broke the link between Bill\u2019s actions and Babak\u2019s loss or injury. \nThe legal case below is another example where the court interprets a break in the chain of causation.\nBreak in chain of causation\nState  Rail Authority of  New South Wales v Chu [2008] NSWCA 14  \n(6 March/uni00A02008)\nMs Chu fell down the stairs  at a  railway  station early in the morning after it had been raining. \nIt was  found that the accident was  caused by  the Rail Authority\u2019s negligence, because of  some \npaint that had been applied to  the edges of the steps which became dangerously slippery \nwhen/uni00A0wet.\nChu had suffered injuries as a  result \nof the fall, including a fractured left \nankle and injury to  her lower  back. She \nalso suffered a  psychological order of a  \ndepressive kind. The situation relating to her claim for psychological injury \nwas complicated by the fact that five or \nsix weeks after the accident, she was  \nsexually assaulted by a  man who had \nbeen assisting her by taking her around and speaking English with/uni00A0her.\nChu argued that the sexual assault \nwas a direct and foreseeable result of  her \nfall at the station. The trial judge agreed and found that her reduced mobility made her more vulnerable, and that this was  \nforeseeable by  the Rail Authority. She was  \nawarded damages of $239 405, which included damages for her psychological injury.\nOn appeal\n, the New  South Wales Court of Appeal found that the sexual assault was  an act \nwhich broke the chain of  causation, and that the conduct of  her assailant was a  free, deliberate \nand informed act. It therefore found there was  a clear break in the causal link between the \ninjury suffered as a  result of the fall, and the injury suffered as a  result of the sexual assault \nmade out some weeks/uni00A0later.\nThe Court, after considering the grounds of appeal by both Chu and the appellant, reduced \ndamages slightly to  $217/uni00A0324.

A link to these websites is provided on your obook assess. Study tip\nIn some circumstances, the time period can be extended, depending on the nature of the case. For \nexample, a person claiming to have a defamation claim may apply to a court for an order extending the \nlimitation period (which is one/uni00A0year). If the court is satis\ufb01ed that it was not reasonable for the plainti\ufb00 to have commenced an action within one/uni00A0year from the date of the publication of the defamatory material, then it may extend the time period for a period of up to three/uni00A0years.\nThere are some civil claims for which there is no limitation period. For example, for people who have \na civil claim with respect to physical or sexual abuse that they su\ufb00ered as a minor, or psychological abuse that arose out of that abuse, there is no time period within which that claim might be issued.

The loss in a civil claim can include: \n\u2022 economic or \ufb01nancial lo ss \u2013 For example, loss of wages, loss of earning capacity, or loss of pro\ufb01ts \nif a contract has been breached.

This is known as limitation of actions. Once that time period has passed, then the defendant will be able to raise a defence that the plainti\ufb00 is too late to obtain any form of remedy.\nThe reason for imposing a time limit within which a person must initiate a claim is so that disputes can \nbe resolved e\ufb03ciently, and a defendant does not have to be subjected to a claim a signi\ufb01cant time after the alleged acts (or omissions) occurred. A/uni00A0delay in issuing a claim can also risk the reliability of evidence, including the evidence of people who may have seen what happened, and physical evidence.\nEach state in Australia has its own statute which is the main statute that sets out the time period within \nwhich an action must be commenced.

Vicarious liability is when somebody becomes responsible for the actions of \nanother. The reasoning behind the employer being liable instead of the employee is that the employer has a right, ability or duty to control the activities of the wrongdoer. The employer should therefore be responsible if the wrongdoer, in undertaking those activities, has caused harm. Vicarious liability generally arises in negligence claims.\nFor an employer to be liable, the plainti\ufb00 needs to establish that the employee was acting in the \ncourse of employment when the wrong occurred. This means that there must have been some connection between the act and the employment. If the employee was acting in an unauthorised way, then the employer may not be found liable.vicarious liability \nthe legal responsibility of a third party for the wrongful acts of another (e.g. an employer\u2019s liability for what their employees do)\n\u2192 GOING FURTHER\nCriminal acts of employees\nIt is possible for an employer to be vicariously liable for the criminal acts of an employee, even if \nthe employer did not authorise the acts. In a 2016 decision of the High Court, it held that attention must be given to any special role and position that the employee was given by the employer. Factors such as the authority, power, trust, control and ability to achieve intimacy can give rise to a finding that the employer will be vicariously liable where an employee has engaged in criminal conduct, and the plaintiff has been harmed. This decision confirms that employers can become vicariously liable for the criminal acts of its employees, such as sexual abuse that occurs in organisations such as schools. \n07_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   211 17/10/2017   1:42 PM",

In a  \n2014 NRL match, a  tackle on McKinnon left him a  \nquadriplegic and confined to  a wheelchair.\nIn December 2016, it was  widely reported in  the \nmedia that McKinnon plans to  sue the NRL and \nanother player, Jordan McLean, over  the tackle. It \nis likely that McKinnon will allege that the NRL is \nvicariously liable for his injuries.CASE\nSTUDY\nPersons involved in wrongdoing\nA person who is involved in the wrongdoing of another may  also be sued. A/uni00A0person may  be involved in \nwrongdoing if/uni00A0they:\n\u2022 aided, abetted (i.e. encouraged) or procured (i.e. organised) the wrongdoing\u2022 induced, or encouraged, the wrongdoing\u2022 w ere in any  way,  directly or indirectly, a party to  the wrongdoing\n\u2022 conspired with others to  cause the wrongdoing.\nThis is known as accessorial liability. A/uni00A0plainti\ufb00  may  decide to  sue somebody else who was  involved \nin the wrongdoing. For  example, if a person was  injured as part of an armed robbery, which was  organised \nby someone who was  not actually present, then this other person may  be seen to  be involved in the \nwrongdoing because they were  indirectly a/uni00A0party.\nThe following example further explores accessorial liability. accessorial liability \na way  in which a person \ncan be found to  be \nresponsible or liable for the loss or harm \nsuffered to  another \nbecause they were directly or indirectly involved in causing the loss or harm (for example, they encourage another person to  cause that \nharm)\nFriend who \u2018egged on\u2019 a mate is/uni00A0sued\nVernon and his mate Harry went out on  Saturday night. After a few  drinks, they both started talking \nabout how it  would be  really funny if  they started tripping people up as  they walked past them. They \nagreed that they would take turns to  trip someone.\nThe boys  started walking down Domain Road in  South Yarra. Harry tripped the first  person, who \nfell over,  and both the boys ran  away  laughing. They then approached 30-year-old Gina, who had a  \nsore leg  after playing soccer that day.  As the boys  walked past her, Harry nudged Vernon and said \n\u2018your turn\u2019. Vernon tripped Gina, who stumbled, fell over  and broke her ankle. She has sued both \nHarry and Vernon.

  "Page 230": "218  UNIT  1 GUILT AND LIABILITYINTRODUCTION TO TORT/uni00A0LAW 8.1 \nCivil law aims to protect the rights of individuals, \ngroups and organisations. If an individual\u2019s rights are infringed, the individual (known as the plainti\ufb00) can take the matter to court (or possibly another dispute resolution body) to ask for compensation as a way of righting the wrong. \nThere are various types of civil law. One of the \nmain areas of civil law is tort law . A/uni00A0tort is a civil \nwrong that one person commits against another. Tort law deals with the rights and obligations that people owe to one another, as well as the infringement of those rights and obligations. The person who commits the wrong, and against whom action may be taken, is often called the tortfeaser (who will be generally known as the defendant if action is taken against them in court). \nThe main aim of tort law is to return a wronged \nperson back to the position he or she was in before the wrong occurred. This is usually done through the awarding of a remedy to the plainti\ufb00, the most common of which is damages . For example, a \nperson who requires medical treatment such as physiotherapy as a result of being injured by the defendant can be compensated and have their medical costs paid until their health returns to normal. \nHistorically, tort law has been created through \ncommon law, though in Victoria some areas of tort law are now contained in statute.\nThere are various torts in Australia. They include:\n\u2022 negligence (e.g. when one person fails to comply with a duty of care owed to another)\n\u2022 defamation (e.g. when one person makes untrue statements about another, causing damage to their reputation)\n\u2022 nuisance (e.g. when a person interferes with another person\u2019s right to enjoy their property)\n\u2022 trespass (e.g. assault, battery, false imprisonment, trespass to land and trespass to goods).\nNegligence is one of the most common forms of tort and occurs in many di\ufb00erent areas of society.\nAs part of Area of Study 3 you are required to study two areas of civil law in depth. For each area of civil \nlaw, you will explore:\u2022 the rights protected by the/uni00A0law\u2022 the elements and defences\u2022 limitation of actions\u2022 the impact of the breach on the parties\u2022 the role of the law (common law and statute law) in developing the elements and the defences.\nSource 1 The tort of negligence imposes a legal \nduty on school teachers to take care of the safety and wellbeing of their students.tort/uni00A0 a wrongful act that is recognised by law\ndefendant/uni00A0 \n(in a civil case) a party who is alleged to have breached a civil law and who is being sued by a plaintiff\ndamages/uni00A0 \nthe most common remedy in a civil claim; an amount of money that the court (or tribunal) orders one party to pay to another\nnegligence/uni00A0 \na type of tort which involves a breach of a duty of care, causing loss or harm\ndefamation/uni00A0 \na type of tort which involves the action of damaging a person\u2019s personal or professional reputation in the community through the communication of false and untrue statements or information\nnuisance \na type of tort which involves interference with a person\u2019s right to use and enjoy property\n08_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   218 17/10/2017   1:57 PM",

  "Page 232": "220  UNIT  1 GUILT AND LIABILITY8.2 NEGLIGENCE\nIn their everyday lives, people regularly come into contact with other people, including strangers. This \ncontact occurs at school, at the local shops, on public transport, in parks and on school excursions. At times, people, including strangers, owe other people a duty to take care to avoid causing/uni00A0harm. \nFor example, teachers and students owe each other a duty to take care:\n\u2022 teachers owe a duty to their students to supervise them appropriately\n\u2022 students owe a duty to each other and their teachers to behave reasonably.\nThe duty may change or expand when teachers take groups of students away on camping or hiking \ntrips, where the risk of injury is increased and dangers are readily foreseeable. \nThe law relating to duty of care is known as negligence. When a person is negligent in civil law, the \nperson has failed to take reasonable care that was due to another. A/uni00A0person is obliged to take care \nwhen it is reasonably foreseeable that other people could be harmed by their actions or omissions. \nRights protected by/uni00A0the/uni00A0law\nAs indicated in the previous topic, laws about negligent conduct have developed over many decades \nthrough common law and through statute law. The Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) also applies to negligence claims.\nThe main purpose of the law of negligence is to protect an individual\u2019s right to be safe from harm, both \nto the person and to their property. This right exists in all circumstances in which we engage with others, whether driving a car, catching public transport, playing sport in a local park or preparing food for service in a caf\u00e9. It is expected that while engaging with others, we are aware of the potential for damage or harm that our actions could cause, and we take reasonable steps to avoid causing harm and damage. \nThe law of negligence also aims to:\n\u2022 pr otect people from wrongful conduct by others, particularly where a person acts recklessly or with \ncomplete disregard for another person \n\u2022 allows parties to seek compensation against those people who have acted contrary to those/uni00A0laws.\nElements required to/uni00A0establish liability\nWhen claiming another person has been negligent, the plainti\ufb00 must prove that the following four elements/uni00A0exist:\n\u2022 duty of  care  \u2013 the defendant owed a duty of care to the person injured\n\u2022 breach of duty of care (standard of care) \u2013 the defendant breached the duty of care\n\u2022 causation \u2013 the breach of duty of care caused the harm to the plainti\ufb00\n\u2022 injury, loss or damage \u2013 the wronged person has su\ufb00ered injury, loss or damage. \nIf it can be proved that the person was owed a duty of care and that the duty of care was breached and \nharm was caused, then the wronged person may be entitled to a remedy, which will ordinarily be damages. \nElement 1 \u2013 Duty of/uni00A0care\nThe plainti\ufb00 must \ufb01rst establish that the defendant owed him or her a \u2018duty of care\u2019 . \nA person owes a duty of care/uni00A0if:\n\u2022 the risk was foreseeable (i.e. the person knew or should have known about the/uni00A0risk of loss or harm)\u2022 the risk was signi\ufb01cant or not insigni\ufb01cant (i.e. not farfetched or fanciful)negligence/uni00A0 \na type of tort which involves a breach of a duty of care, causing loss or harm\nThe American Museum of Tort Law offers a history of cases.

This is especially critical in hospital emergency departments, \nwhere doctors and nurses are often required to assess patients who arrive with serious injuries.\nChild drowns in workers\u2019 trench\nChester v Waverley Municipal Council (1939) 62 CLR 1\nIn 1939, workers of the Waverley Municipal Council in New South Wales had dug a trench. They \nplaced a railing around the trench (which was not childproof) and left for the day. Rain filled the trench with water. Ms Chester\u2019s son, who was seven, fell into the hole and drowned. As a result of finding and seeing him hours later, she suffered significant nervous shock and distress. She sued the council for negligence, claiming that it owed her a duty of care.\nThe High Court on appeal found that the Council owed a duty of care to the child. However, \nthe Court said that the Council did not owe a duty of care to the mother, stating that it was not reasonably foreseeable that their actions towards the child would so affect a mother seeing the dead body of her child. One judge of the High Court dissented (meaning he disagreed with the/uni00A0others).LEGAL \nCASE\nExceptions to/uni00A0the duty of/uni00A0care\nThere are some exceptions to the duty of/uni00A0care.\n\u2022 W hen participating in a risky recreational activity, consumers can sign a waiver to show they \naccept responsibility for injuries. For example, bungy-jump operators may ask patrons to sign a waiver \naccepting any reasonable risk associated with the jump, but if the operator has not maintained their equipment or has said the jump was safe when it was not then the operator will still be liable for a patron\u2019s injury.\n\u2022 A good Samaritan is a person who gives care, help and advice in an emergency situation. \u2018Good \nSamaritans\u2019 are exempt from legal liability in negligence claims as long as they act in good faith, within their competence and without payment.\n\u2022 A person who donates food in good faith for charitable purposes is protected from legal liability if a person is harmed from having consumed the food, as long as the food was safe to consume at the time it left the possession or control of the/uni00A0donor.\n\u2022 Volunteers (people who do community work for a community organisation, association, local government or public authority) cannot be held personally liable if they cause damage or injury to another.\n08_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   221 17/10/2017   1:57 PM",
  "Page 234": "222  UNIT  1 GUILT AND LIABILITYSchool incident during recess results in negligence/uni00A0claim\nRoman Catholic Church v Hadba (2005) 221 CLR/uni00A0161\nIn 1999 an eight-year-old girl, Farrah Hadba, fell from a flying fox in the playground of St Anthony's \nPrimary School, ACT. The incident occurred during morning recess.\nAccording to evidence presented in court, there were two teachers on supervision in the \narea in which the child was injured. The school had developed a \u2018hands off\u2019 rule when others were using the play equipment. Despite this rule, one boy and one girl grabbed Farrah\u2019s legs while she was on the flying fox, and she fell and sustained injuries. The teacher on duty had momentarily looked away when the incident occurred.\nA majority of High Court justices found that the school was not liable. The High Court \nstated that \u2018it must be remembered that there was no evidence of any serious accident on the flying fox in the past, there was no evidence of pupils having pulled each other from the flying fox in the past, and there was a well-known and enforced school policy against this. The magnitude of the risk of injury was not high, and nor was the degree of probability of its occurrence.\u2019\nThe High Court also found that the incident may not have been prevented even if the teacher \nhad been watching the playground area. On this basis, the cause of the injury to the child was not the lack of supervision by the school, which the Court ruled had behaved appropriately by having a clearly stated \u2018hands off rule\u2019 that had been communicated to the children.LEGAL \nCASE\nSource 2 An injury \nsuffered on a flying fox was at the centre of a case that focused on the liability of schools for playground accidents.\nElement 2 \u2013 Breach of/uni00A0a duty of/uni00A0care (standard of/uni00A0care)\nA breach of a duty of care occurs when a person does not take all the care they should. The duty \nis breached (broken) when the defendant fails to do what a reasonable person would have done. In determining whether a reasonable person would have taken precautions against a risk of harm, the court considers:\n\u2022 the likely risk of/uni00A0harm\u2022 the likely seriousness of the/uni00A0harm\u2022 the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of/uni00A0harm\u2022 the social utility (bene\ufb01t or worth) of the activity that creates the risk of/uni00A0harm.\nFor example in Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40 (see Topic 3.7), in which a waterskier \nsu\ufb00ered signi\ufb01cant injuries, the Council ought to have known that the harm su\ufb00ered was serious, and the \nburden of taking precautions would have been small.\nElement 3 \u2013 Causation\nTo succeed in a negligence claim, the plainti\ufb00 has to prove that the injury or loss was caused by the breach of duty of care, and the injury would not have occurred without the breach of duty of care. \nIf it can be shown that the harm was too remote from the breach of duty of care, the plainti\ufb00 will not \nbe successful in claiming negligence. For example, a person may su\ufb00er nervous shock from hearing a car accident but not actually seeing it happen. This harm may be too remote from the actual event.\nIn other circumstances, there may be a break in the chain of causation. This is where some new \nact occurred between the tort happening and the loss or damage being claimed. \nIn Roman Catholic Church v Hadba (2005) 221 CLR 161, the High Court found that a school was not \nliable in relation to an incident involving a \ufb02ying fox during recess.\n08_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   222 17/10/2017   1:57 PM",
  "Page 235": "223  CHAPTER/uni00A08  TORT LAW Element 4 \u2013 Injury, loss or \ndamage\nAs a general rule, the plainti\ufb00 can only seek a legal remedy \nthrough the law of negligence if it can be proved that he or she su\ufb00ered an injury, loss or damage, even if it is minor. The injury, loss or damage can be physical, mental or damage to property.\nLimitation of/uni00A0actions\nThe Limitation of Actions Act 1958 (Vic) sets out the limitation \nperiods for negligence claims. These are outlined in Source 4, and range from three to six/uni00A0years, depending on the injury su\ufb00ered.Source 3 If a local council fails to remove a dead branch on a tree \nwhen requested to do so, and the branch then falls and causes loss or harm to someone, the council may have breached its duty of care. The maintenance of public gardens is an important role played by local government.\nTYPE OF NEGLIGENCE CLAIM TIME PERIOD\nGeneral negligence claims (e.g. a claim for property damage) 6/uni00A0years\nAn action for damages for negligence where personal injury includes a disease or disorder 3/uni00A0years \nAn action for damages for negligence where the injury was death or personal injury Either 3 or 12/uni00A0years\nSource 4 Limitation periods for negligence claims \nThe court is able to extend the limitation period in certain circumstances.\nCalculation of/uni00A0time \nThe start of limitation periods for negligence claims depends on the type of injury. For example:\n\u2022 for general negligence claims, the time starts from the date on which the cause of action accrued \n(i.e. when the loss or damage was su\ufb00ered by the plainti\ufb00) \n\u2022 for actions involving a disease or disorder, the time starts from the date on which the person \ufb01rst knows \nthey have the disease or disorder and that the disease or disorder was caused by the defendant. \nDeath or personal injury claims \n The limitation period for death or personal injury claims is whichever of the following expires/uni00A0\ufb01rst:\u2022 12/uni00A0 years from the date of the conduct of the defendant which caused the death or injury (known as the \n\u2018long-stop limitation period\u2019)/uni00A0or \n\u2022 thr ee years from the date of which the cause of action was \u2018discoverable\u2019 . A/uni00A0\u2018discoverable\u2019 date is the \ndate the plainti\ufb00 knows or ought to have known that the death or personal injury occurred, was caused \nby the defendant, and in relation to personal injury, it was serious enough to justify bringing the action. \nThe above does not apply to work injuries or transport accident injuries. They also do not apply to \ninjuries as a result of a dust-related condition.\nChild/uni00A0abuse\nIn 2015, the Victorian Parliament passed legislation which amended the limitation period for certain \nactions involving child abuse. This amendment followed the release of a report called Betrayal of Trust, after a government inquiry into child abuse allegations against religious and other organisations. The legislation now removes limitation periods in respect of child abuse to allow survivors to bring a civil action regardless of the time that has passed since the act occurred. In some countries there \nis a tort for invasion of privacy. In Australia this tort has not yet developed.Did you/uni00A0know?\n08_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   223 17/10/2017   1:57 PM",
  "Page 236": "224  UNIT  1 GUILT AND LIABILITYPossible defences\nThe defendant can claim that the plainti\ufb00 has not established the elements of negligence. That is, the \ndefendant may try to prove that a duty was not owed, a duty was not breached, that the damage or injury was too remote from the defendant\u2019s act or omission, or that no loss or harm has been su\ufb00ered. If all elements are proven, the defendant may have to rely on one of the following defences:\n\u2022 contributory negligence\n\u2022 assumption of risk (volenti non \ufb01t injuria).\nThese are discussed in more detail below.\nDefence 1 \u2013 Contributory negligence\nThe defendant may try to prove that the plainti\ufb00 contributed to the harmful situation or is partly to blame \nfor the harm done. For example, a person may make a claim that they su\ufb00ered personal injury as a result of being pushed by the defendant. However, their claim, if proven, would be reduced if it were shown that the plainti\ufb00 was intoxicated at the time. Contributory negligence will generally reduce the amount of damages that the defendant would be required to pay to the plainti\ufb00 to compensate them for their loss, damage or injury. \nIn determining contributory negligence, the court will examine the conduct of the plainti\ufb00 and assess \nhow they might have contributed to their own loss, damage or injury. In cases where the plainti\ufb00 was found to have contributed very signi\ufb01cantly to their own loss, the amount of damages awarded might be negligible. \nThe legal case Guru v Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd [2016] NSWDC 349 (14 December 2016) is \nan example of a case where the defendant argued contributory negligence.contributory \nnegligence a formal defence to negligence which claims the plaintiff contributed to the harm caused by the defendant.

In its defence, Coles claimed that Guru contributed to her \nharm, because she had failed to look down at her feet as she was walking, as well as failed to maintain a proper lookout. In December 2016, the NSW District Court found in favour of Guru and awarded her $90 000 in damages. The judge found that Coles had failed to prevent the grapes from causing a safety risk to shoppers. It dismissed the contributory negligence defence, finding that it was not reasonable for a person to keep a lookout while looking at goods on display.LEGAL \nCASE\nDefence 2 \u2013 Assumption of/uni00A0risk (volenti non fit injuria)\nThe defence of volenti non \ufb01t injuria refers to the voluntary acceptance of the risk of injury. In Latin, the term literally states \u2018to a willing person, injury I not done\u2019 . This means that the defendant must prove that the plainti\ufb00 was aware of an obvious risk and that he or she voluntarily chose to take the risk. For example, a person who knowingly accepts a ride with a drunken driver is accepting an obvious risk of being injured in a car accident, as it is well known that excessive alcohol consumption impairs driving ability.\n08_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   224 17/10/2017   1:57 PM",

Failing to update details can be considered contributory negligence.\nSimilarly, sportspeople accept the risk of su\ufb00ering common injuries that \nmay occur within the rules of their sport. For example, jockeys consent to \ninjuries of the type reasonably expected in racing. However, assumption of risk does not apply in cases involving the provision of professional or health services as health providers have a legal responsibility to warn people of any inherent risk associated with their/uni00A0work.\nThe role of/uni00A0the law in/uni00A0developing \nthe/uni00A0elements and defences\nThe law of negligence has been largely developed through common law, and \nwas inherited in Australia through English common/uni00A0law. \nHowever, from around 2002, Victoria and other states and territories have \npassed legislation that either adopts or amends the common law principles of negligence. \nCommon/uni00A0law\nAs explored in Chapter 3, the landmark case of Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] All ER Rep 1 \ufb01rmly established the tort of negligence. The principles in that case were ultimately adopted in Australia and remain important today. They allow plainti\ufb00s to take legal action on the grounds that a defendant did not act in a way to protect the interests of their \u2018neighbour\u2019 (under the neighbour principle). \nThe Australian case of Grant v Australian Knitting Mills (1936) AC 85 \nadopted the principles established in Donoghue v Stevenson. This allowed parties to sue manufacturers who were negligent. \nThe law of negligence was signi\ufb01cantly developed by the courts after \nthis time. However, common law has been modi\ufb01ed and adopted by various statutes in Australia, including statutes in Victoria. In particular, a series of statutes were passed by states and territories in around 2002 and 2003 after concerns were raised that the law of negligence was unclear and unpredictable, and it had become too easy for plainti\ufb00s in personal injury cases to be successful in negligence claims. \nStatute/uni00A0law\nIn Victoria, Part X of the Wrongs Act is now the main legislation in Victoria which governs negligence claims. That part was inserted into the Wrongs Act in 2003 following a committee which inquired into and made recommendations about negligence laws in 2002 after the above concerns about the law of negligence were raised. \nThe Wrongs Act changes many common law principles related to negligence. In other aspects, the \ncommon law principles of negligence continue to apply. For example, in Section 54 of the Wrongs Act , \nwhich allows a defence of volenti non \ufb01t injuria to be raised, it states that the common law continues \nto apply. \nIn addition to the Wrongs Act, other statutes also cover negligence claims in some areas. For example, \nthe Australian Consumer Law (ACL), which commenced on 1 January 2011, is the national code for fair trading and consumer protection. Some parts of the ACL incorporate elements of negligence, such as imposing a duty on people who provide services to provide them with \u2018due care and skill\u2019 . neighbour principle \nin relation to negligence, the common law rule that a person must take reasonable care to avoid acts and omissions that can reasonably be foreseen as likely to injure their \u2018neighbours\u2019 (i.e. people who would be closely and directly affected by their acts or omissions)\nSource 6 Both Victorian and Australian laws in relation to food handling and service can be traced back to the common law principles established in the case of Donoghue v/uni00A0Stevenson.\n08_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   225 17/10/2017   1:57 PM",

For example, an employer fails to maintain \nmachinery so that it is in good working order which causes a fatal accident.\n\u2022 Permanent physical incapacity \u2013 This could require the use of personal carers for the remainder of \nthe person\u2019s life. For example, a person contracts salmonella from the consumption of poorly prepared \nfood and permanently loses physical capacity as a result.\n\u2022 Serious physical injury \u2013 This could require treatment such as surgery and physiotherapy. For example, a customer who trips on a slippery \ufb02oor and breaks a leg as a result.\n\u2022 Emotional impact of the breach \u2013 This could manifest as fear of certain places or engaging in social \nsituations. For example, a person develops a fear of medical procedures after a negligent experience.\n\u2022 Loss of wages and livelihood \u2013 This could be a consequence of requiring surgery or treatment. \nFor example, a person is unable to return to work for a certain time after surgery.\n\u2022 Unemployment \u2013 This could be a consequence of physical injury or mental health issues.

For \nexample, the defendant might also have su\ufb00ered loss, injury or damage as a result of the conduct of the plainti\ufb00. \n\u2022 Costs \u2013 This could occur when the defendant loses the case. For example, the defendant might be \nordered to pay the legal costs of the plainti\ufb00, causing \ufb01nancial hardship.\n\u2022 Need to sell assets \u2013 This could be a consequence of a high damages award.

The group must be su\ufb03ciently small for it to be \nrecognised that the plainti\ufb00 is part of that group and that his or her reputation is lowered by reference to the/uni00A0group.\nThe example below explores this element in relation to an open letter about a mayor.Social media platforms used to make defamatory \nstatements\nMickle v Farley [2013] NSWDC 295 (29 November/uni00A02013)\nThe District Court of New South Wales ordered a former student to pay \n$105 000 to a school teacher after making defamatory comments on \nTwitter and Facebook.\nAndrew Farley was 20/uni00A0years old when he posted a series of defamatory \ncomments on the two social media sites. The Court found that the effect of the publication on the plaintiff was devastating. She took sick leave and later returned to work on a limited basis. District Judge Michael Elkaim ordered that Farley pay the teacher $105 000 in damages. The \njudge noted that, \u2018When defamatory publications are made on social media it is common knowledge that they spread. They are spread easily by the simple manipulation of mobile phones and computers. Their evil lies in the grapevine effect that stems from the use of this type of \ncommunication.\u2019LEGAL \nCASE\nSource 1 The tort of defamation has kept \npace with developments in social media, especially the use of Twitter and Facebook.\nPlaintiff not/uni00A0named\nA man wrote an open letter to \u2018the current local mayor\u2019 of his hometown, in which he made \nderogatory and defamatory statements about the mayor. The open letter did not refer to the mayor by name. However, the open letter was clear enough that the people reading it could reasonably assume that it was about the mayor.EXAMPLE\n08_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   229 17/10/2017   1:57 PM",
  "Page 242": "230  UNIT  1 GUILT AND LIABILITYElement 4 \u2013 The defendant published the/uni00A0defamatory \nstatement\nThe plainti\ufb00 must prove that the statement was communicated to a person other than the plainti\ufb00. \nIt is not defamation for a person to make untrue or derogatory comments directly to the person concerned if it is done in private. However, these comments will become actionable once a third person reads, hears or sees the defamatory material.\nIt does not matter whether the material is published to the general public or to a smaller group. \nIn fact, what seems like harmless chat may be defamatory. For example, a case of defamation may exist where Jane tells Peter that Shaun is a convicted thief and Peter repeats this to Paul and Mary knowing that the information might be/uni00A0wrong.\nPublications can either be verbal or in writing, though most defamation cases are in relation to \nwritten publications. These can include articles, letters and books, as well as online publications such as blogs, websites, articles and comments made on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.\nLimitation of/uni00A0actions\nUnder Section 5(1AAA) of the Limitation of Actions Act 1958 (Vic) , an action for defamation must be \nbrought within one year from the date of the publication of the matter. \nHowever, a person claiming to have a cause of action for defamation may apply to a court for \nan order extending the limitation period. A/uni00A0court may extend the limitation period by up to 3/uni00A0years from the date of the publication of the allegedly defamatory material. This can only be extended if the court is satis\ufb01ed that it was not reasonable for the plainti\ufb00 to have commenced an action within 1/uni00A0year from the date of publication.\nPossible defences\nThe defendant may argue that any or all of the elements of a defamation action have not been proved. That is, the defendant may argue that the statement is not defamatory, or that it does not refer to the plainti\ufb00, or that he or she did not \npublish the statement. \nOtherwise, if all the elements have been \nsatis\ufb01ed, the defendant may be able to rely on \none of the defences set out in Source 2.\nDefence  1 \u2013 Justification\nThe defence of justi\ufb01cation applies when a defamatory statement is substantially true . This means \nthat the vast majority of the article is true. For example, a person who commits an act of indecent exposure before a crowd of 50 people cannot claim defamation if a publication wrongly states that there was a crowd of 30, as the substance (core issue) of the publication is true (being the fact that the person committed an act of indecent exposure).\nThe following legal case explores how the defence of justi\ufb01cation could be used against a defamation \ncharge.Source 2 If all of the elements are proven, the \ndefendant may rely on any of the above defences.Cartoonists have long been regarded as satirists whose commentary on political and social issues adds to public debate.

If the plainti\ufb00 claims that the incorrect statement is defamatory, then the defendant may argue contextual truth because, when read in context, the statement is substantially true, and the claim that the plainti\ufb00 was without a helmet does not further harm the plainti\ufb00\u2019s reputation. The truth of the more serious allegations overrides the falsehood in the less serious allegation, because the e\ufb00ect of the untrue statement on the plainti\ufb00\u2019s reputation is insigni\ufb01cant.\nThe following legal case provides further insight into the tort of defamation.Stephen Dank and the peptides/uni00A0saga\nDank v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2016] NSWSC 295 (18 March/uni00A02016)\nSports scientist Stephen Dank brought a defamation claim in the New South Wales Supreme Court against Nationwide News Pty Ltd in relation to various articles published in 2013 in the Daily Telegraph and the Sunday Telegraph. \nIn this case, Dank sought damages over articles published in relation to supplements \nadministered to Cronulla Sharks players. Part of the case focused on NRL player, Jon Mannah, who the articles alleged had been given peptides by Dank, and that by doing so, he had accelerated Mannah\u2019s death from cancer. This claim by the newspaper was found to be true. At the trial, a civil jury found that Dank had acted with \u2018reckless indifference\u2019 to the life of Mr Mannah, who passed away in January 2013 after a relapse of Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.\nThere was, however, a small win in the case for Dank, in which \nthe jury found that the defendant had wrongly stated that Dank had injected NRL players from the Cronulla Sharks with the drug warfarin. Dank established that the drug he had used on the players was instead a feed supplement for horses. However, no damages were awarded to/uni00A0Dank. \nThe Court ordered that Dank pay the legal costs of the defendant. \nEstimates were that the combined costs of Dank\u2019s legal fees and those \nof Nationwide News would be in excess of $2/uni00A0million.\nSource 3 In March 2016, sports scientist \nStephen Dank lost a defamation case in the NSW Supreme Court that he had brought against the publisher of newspapers such as the Daily Telegraph.

This inconsistency in law \nthroughout Australia was considered inappropriate.\nOn 1 January 2006, new uniform defamation legislation came into force throughout Australia and in \nthe Australian Capital Territory. Each of the states passed a statute (in Victoria it was the Defamation Act) that was modelled on the proposed uniform defamation laws, developed through an agreement between the Commonwealth and the states.\nUnder the law in Australia, any person or organisation who has had defamatory material published \nabout them can take legal action when needed. Such action can be taken against authors, publishers, broadcasters and distributors.\nIn some places, the common law principles have been amended or abolished by the statute. For \nexample, Section 7 of the Defamation Act abolishes the distinction between slander and libel. In addition, the Act now provides that a corporation (other than those excluded) has no cause of action for defamation. However, unless the Act speci\ufb01es otherwise, it does not a\ufb00ect the operation of common law principles in relation to defamation. That is, the common law principles will continue to apply unless the Act speci\ufb01cally abolishes/uni00A0them. \nThe courts continue to have a role in determining defamation cases in light of the relevant principles. By \nway of example, the High Court has found that there is an implied freedom of political communication \nin the Australian Constitution. This is not an absolute right to freedom of speech, but is a right to discuss political matters freely and openly without fear of being subjected to a defamation claim. This implied freedom therefore places restrictions on a person\u2019s right to claim defamation where a person is speaking freely about political matters. \nPossible impacts of/uni00A0the/uni00A0breach\nImpact of/uni00A0defamation on/uni00A0the plaintiff\nThe impact of a breach of defamation laws on the plainti\ufb00 depends on the nature of the statements that have been made about the plainti\ufb00. Some of the typical impacts are as follows:\n\u2022 Loss of reputation \u2013 This could include loss of status. For example, the plainti\ufb00 could be shunned \nby people with whom they once associated.\n\u2022 Emotional impact of the defamatory material \u2013 This could be a consequence of the publicity of \nthe claim. For example, a person could develop conditions such as depression and anxiety as a result of the defamation. \n\u2022 Loss of wages and livelihood \u2013 This could be a consequence of loss of reputation. For example, \nthe plainti\ufb00 might need to take time o\ufb00 work to attend court proceedings.\n\u2022 Unemployment \u2013 This could be a consequence of loss of reputation. For example, an employee might lose their job if the defamatory statement negatively alters the reputation of their employer.\nImpact of/uni00A0defamation on/uni00A0the defendant\nSome of the possible impacts on the defendant include:\n\u2022 Costs \u2013 This could occur when the defendant loses the case.

  "Page 248": "236  UNIT  1 GUILT AND LIABILITYNUISANCE 8.4 \nNuisance deals with the violation of the right of a person to reasonable convenience and comfort in \nlife. In e\ufb00ect, this tort looks at competing land uses and which should take precedence over another. For example, if a new freeway is to be constructed, is it reasonable that people living in the area be inconvenienced for three years by dust, noise, vibrations and lack of access to public roads? In the event of a dispute, questions would be asked about whether this is a reasonable interference.\nThere are two types of nuisance:\n\u2022 private nuisance\n\u2022 public nuisance.\nPrivate nuisance occurs where there is an act or omission that substantially and unreasonably interferes \nwith a person\u2019s use and enjoyment of their own land. The law also covers activities that might cause \npeople to fear for their safety, such as the aerial spraying of crops. \nPrivate nuisance cannot result in criminal charges against the wrongdoer. \nIf a person occupies land and they allow another person to cause nuisance on that land, then the \noccupier of that land can also be held legally responsible. For example, if a person owns a facility that \nis used for public events such as weddings and 21st birthday parties, they remain liable for any excessive noise or other interference to neighbours that occurs on that land. The owner of the facility cannot argue that if they were not present on that night, then they are not responsible.\nPublic nuisance occurs where, to a considerable degree, there is an act or omission that interferes \nwith the comfort or convenience of a number of people. This can involve the ability to access a public place such as a park, roadway or a building. A/uni00A0public health nuisance can also include rubbish being left on a property. If a group of people decide to block a public road, this would a\ufb00ect a signi\ufb01cant number of people, such as those going to work, students attending school and children being taken to medical appointments by their parents. \nTo have an action for public nuisance, any a\ufb00ected person would need to show that they have su\ufb00ered \nspecial damage that extends beyond what may have been experienced by other members of the public. \nUnder Australian law, public nuisance can also constitute a criminal o\ufb00ence.\nRights protected by/uni00A0the/uni00A0law\nThere is a di\ufb00erence between the word \u2018nuisance\u2019 that we use in everyday life and the tort of nuisance. If someone asks us to run down to the shop to get a bottle of milk, that might be \u2018a nuisance\u2019 (a bother) but it is not a legal nuisance.

The old mansion had been divided into three separate units. \nThe local council, the City of Port Phillip, had issued notices to \nthe property owner due to excessive noise that had caused great inconvenience to neighbours. One of the residents had kept a diary of the nuisance caused by noise, and more than 70 incidents were recorded over a four-month period.\nIn the case, the property owner stated that he was away from the \nproperty for six months of the year and was unaware of the noise level being caused by his tenants. When he became aware of this, he evicted/uni00A0them.\nThe case is a good example of how a local council will try and \nintervene where a neighbour is causing nuisance.

This interference can involve a range of actions on the part of the defendant, including noises, dust, vibration, water run-o\ufb00s, or even objects (such as golf balls). The following case provides an example of the way a nuisance can a\ufb00ect a plainti\ufb00\u2019s ability to develop a property for commercial gain.\nSource 1 Wild parties at a Ripponlea villa \nresulted in a nuisance claim. \n08_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   237 17/10/2017   1:57 PM",

The damage can be material or non-material damage. Material damage includes physical damage (e.g. damage to crops), and non-material damage includes non-physical damage (e.g. loss of revenue). For a public nuisance claim, the plainti\ufb00 has to establish that the interference caused them a much greater impact than that on the wider public. \nThe following legal case sets out an example of how a company can su\ufb00er damage as a result of a \nnuisance.When analysing a case \nof public nuisance, remember that for an individual to have an action for compensation for the inconvenience or interference, they must show that the impact caused them \u2018special damage\u2019. The impact on the plaintiff must be shown to be greater than that suffered by the general public.Study/uni00A0tipNuisance and the endangered froglet\nGales Holdings Pty Ltd v Tweed SC [2011] NSWSC/uni00A01128 \n(21/uni00A0September/uni00A02011)\nIn this case, the plaintiff (Gales) owned a 27-hectare parcel of undeveloped land in the suburb \nof Kingscliff (NSW), which was intended for development as a shopping centre. The plaintiff claimed that its land had become undevelopable because the local council had allowed polluted stormwater to run onto the property. In the process, the water lay in pools on the ground, which created an ideal habitat for the Wallum Froglet, an endangered species. The species breeds in swamps with permanent groundwater as well as shallow pools and drainage ditches. Given the endangered nature of the froglet, the plaintiff was unable to develop its land, which it claimed amounted to an interference by the defendant with the plaintiff\u2019s use of its property.\nThe NSW Supreme Court found that the local council had caused a nuisance in allowing \nstormwater to run onto the property, although there was evidence that the froglet had existed on the land in the past, so the damages sought by the plaintiff were reduced. The Court ruled that the Council must contribute to the plaintiff\u2019s additional costs in developing the land to make it suitable for the froglet.\nThe Court awarded damages of $600 000, together with other orders to abate the nuisance \nthat had been occurring since May 2004. The Court also ruled that compensation was not payable by the defendant for any loss of value of the area of land that was to be used for the Wallum Froglet habitat.\nIn her judgment, Justice Bergin said:/uni00A0\u2018If the defendant knew or ought to have known of the \nnuisance and the real risk of reasonably foreseeable consequential damage to the plaintiff, it had an obligation to take such positive action as a reasonable person in its position and circumstances would consider necessary to eliminate the nuisance\u2019.LEGAL \nCASE\n08_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   238 17/10/2017   1:57 PM",

The application must be considered \u2018fair and reasonable\u2019 . In considering applications, \nthe court takes into account factors such as the reasons for the plainti\ufb00\u2019s delay in commencing the action. \nPossible defences\nThe defendant may argue that any or all of the elements of nuisance have not been proven. That is, the defendant may try to prove that the plainti\ufb00 did not have a right to the property, there was no interference with the plainti\ufb00\u2019s use and enjoyment of the land, or the plainti\ufb00 did not su\ufb00er damage. If all elements are proven, the defendant may rely on one of the following three defences:\n\u2022 statutory authorisation\u2022 consent\u2022 reasonable use.\nDefence 1 \u2013 Statutory authorisation\nThe defendant in cases involving the tort of nuisance can argue the defence of statutory authorisation. \nThis means that legislation passed by the Victorian or Commonwealth parliaments allows the conduct that the plainti\ufb00 has claimed constitutes nuisance. This includes post o\ufb03ce sta\ufb00 and council o\ufb03cers as well as gas, water and electricity meter readers. Police o\ufb03cers are also allowed to enter property if they Guns and silver/uni00A0foxes\nHollywood Silverfox Farm Ltd v Emmett [1936] 2/uni00A0KB/uni00A0468\nHollywood Silver Fox Farm bred silver foxes which, if disturbed during breeding, may refuse to breed, or even kill their young. In this case, there was a dispute between the plaintiff and the defendant, which saw the defendant\u2019s son fire a gun on his land where it was close to the fox\u2019s breeding pens. As a result, Hollywood Silverfox Farm Ltd brought an action under the tort of nuisance, seeking an injunction to prevent this behaviour in \nfuture. The key legal issue in the case was whether a landowner has the absolute right to create noise on their property.\nThe court granted an injunction on the grounds that where noise \nhas been created, the motive behind the production of that noise must be taken into account. In this case, the primary motivation of the defendant\u2019s son when firing the gun was to cause interference with the plaintiff\u2019s use of/uni00A0land.LEGAL \nCASE\nWhen it comes to noise, \nHarley Davidsons are the most complained about motorbikes in Victoria.

The Victorian Planning Minister argued, however,  that the inconvenience to  the public could be limited by careful planning. \nThe Minister said the tunnel was  essential to  meet future transport needs, and short-term \ndisruption was  necessary for  the long-term gain of two 9 km  underground tunnels connecting \nsome of Melbourne\u2019s busiest train lines. The project would also create five new  stations \u2014  \nArden, Parkville, CBD North, CBD South and Domain.\nEarlier plans for  the tunnel were  amended to  reduce the \nneed to  acquire property in Kensington, and revised plans \nallowed it to  run deeper underground to  reduce the impact \non Fawkner Park in South Yarra. The Government also placed limits on the emission of vibrations and noise, and alternate accommodation would also be provided to  affected residents.\nAs construction began, some Melbourne hospitals raised \nconcerns about damage to  buildings as a  result of  underground \ndrilling. The Royal  Melbourne Hospital was  at particular risk. \nThe Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne also raised concerns about the impact of tunnelling on St Paul\u2019s  Cathedral. In \nresponse, the Government established an Independent Environmental Auditor to  monitor the construction.CASE \nSTUDY\nSource 3 The Melbourne Metro Tunnel project will \ninvolve many years of inconvenience to  the public. \nThese works have been authorised by statutes of the Victorian Parliament.\n08_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   240 17/10/2017   1:57 PM",

This period saw  the development of statute \nlaw relating to town  planning and zoning of land, so  that competing interests for  land could be addressed \nmore readily. This has continued to  the present day,  where environmental laws  have  added another layer \nto nuisance laws,  with strict controls placed on factories and other industries that have  the potential to  \npollute surrounding areas. Governments have  also imposed strict penalties for  polluting the environment \nand impeding the free movement of others.\nThe case study below highlights the development of the law  to keep  up with present day  issues.Offensively noisy music students\nChristie v Davey [1893] 1 Ch/uni00A0D/uni00A0316\nIn this British case the plaintiff, Mrs  Christie, was  a music teacher who for  several  years had \nbeen giving lessons to  students in  her house, which shared a  common wall with her neighbour, \nwho was the defendant in this/uni00A0case.\nThe defendant didn\u2019t appreciate the noise from the plaintiff\u2019s students, and decided to  \nprotest by banging on the adjoining walls between the properties, shouting, blowing whistles \nand bashing tin cans to  create as much disturbance as possible. \nThe plaintiff took the defendant to  court claiming private nuisance and arguing that as a  music \nteacher, the lessons were  part of her daily work routine. The court held that the defendant\u2019s \nbehaviour was  \u2018malicious\u2019 in that the intention was to  impact the music lessons and therefore \nthe plaintiff\u2019s livelihood. The court ruled that such behaviour on the part of the defendant was  \nnot a  reasonable use of  his land. The defendant was  ordered to  stop  such disruptive behaviour.LEGAL  \nCASE\nCreating  safe  zones  for abortion  clinics\nPublic Health and Wellbeing Amendment (Safe  Access) Act 2015/uni00A0(Vic)\nUnder amendments to  legislation passed by  the Victorian Parliament, women can  access  lawful \nmedical services free from harassment and intimidation. The new  legislation establishes safe \naccess  zones around abortion providers.\nThe legislation imposes a  150-metre safe-access zone around hospitals, GP clinics and \nhealth services that perform abortions, where it is an offence to  engage in behaviour that \nharasses or intimidates women seeking to  access  an abortion. Under the law, it is also illegal \nto film people without consent within the safe access  zone, or  for anyone to  impede access  to a \nfootpath, road or vehicle without a reasonable excuse within the/uni00A0zone.CASE \nSTUDY\n08_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   241 17/10/2017   1:57 PM",

Many of these establish o\ufb00ences where someone is interfering with property. For example:\n\u2022 Under the Summary O\ufb00ences Act 1966 (Vic), individuals who light \ufb01res on their property that damage, \ndestroy or endanger another property may be prosecuted under criminal/uni00A0law.\n\u2022 The Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008 (Vic) provides that it is illegal to allow a nuisance to emanate \nfrom any premises owned or occupied by that person.

For example, a neighbour attending a mediation hearing. \n\u2022 Costs \u2013 This could occur when the defendant loses the case. For example, the defendant might be \nordered to pay the legal costs of the plainti\ufb00, causing \ufb01nancial hardship.\n\u2022 Business f ailure \u2013This could be a consequence of an injunction.

If an individual\u2019s \nrights are  infringed, the individual (known as the plainti\ufb00) can take  the matter to  court (or possibly another \ndispute resolution body) to  ask for  compensation as a way  of righting the wrong.\nThere are  various types of  civil law . One of the main areas of civil law  is tort law.  A tort is a civil \nwrong that one person commits against another. Tort  law deals with the rights and obligations that people \nowe to others and the infringement of those rights and obligations. Tort  law is explored in Chapter 8.\nHowever, tort  law is not the only type of civil law.  There are  various other types of  law that govern  \ndisputes between individuals and groups. They  include:\n\u2022 la ws which prohibit discrimination\n\u2022 la ws relating to  marriage, and when a marriage may  be void (not valid)\n\u2022 la ws that apply to  online shopping\n\u2022 workplace laws,  including laws  that specify what a person needs to  be paid in employment, and what \nconditions they are  entitled to.plainti\ufb00 \n(in civil disputes) the party who makes a legal claim against another person (i.e. the defendant) in court\ncivil law  \nan area of law that \ndefines the rights and responsibilities of individuals, groups and organisations in society and regulates private disputes (as opposed to  \ncriminal law)\ntort \na wrongful act that is \nrecognised by law\ndiscrimination \nthe unfavourable treatment of a person based on a certain attribute (e.g. age, gender, disability, ethnicity, religion or sexuality).

This is usually done through the awarding of a remedy to  the plainti\ufb00, the most \ncommon of which is damages. This is an amount of money to  be paid by  the defendant to  the plainti\ufb00. \nFor example, if a person has bought an appliance online, and that appliance is faulty and caused damage \nto a house, the person may  be able to  seek compensation for  the damage caused. In other types of civil \nlaw, such as laws  relating to  void marriages, the appropriate remedy may  be an order that the marriage \nwas not valid (that is,  did not comply with marriage laws).\nSome of these laws,  such as laws  which prohibit discrimination and laws  relating to  marriage, are  \ncontained in statute. Other laws,  such as laws  relating to  online shopping, have  been created through \ncommon law.  Even though online shopping is a new phenomenon and has grown  substantially because \nof the development of the internet, the laws  that govern  this type of shopping are  contract laws.  This \nis because online shopping purchases result in a contract being formed which governs that purchase. \nContract laws  have  been around for  decades, and have  been developed over  the years through the courts.\nAs part of Area of Study 3 you  a re required to  study two  areas of civil law  in depth.

  "Page 262": "250  UNIT  1 GUIL T AND LIABILITYDISCRIMINATION 9.2 \nOne right that individuals in Australia have  is the right to  be free from discrimination. Discrimination \nmeans treating someone less favourably than others on the basis of  attributes such as race, religious \nbelief, disability, or age.  Discrimination can be direct discrimination or indirect discrimination, and \ncan occur in all aspects of life, such as in schools, in the workplace, in sporting clubs, in membership clubs, \nin places of accommodation, or when buying goods or services.\nThere are  many laws  that aim to  protect people from discrimination. For  example, the Charter of  \nHuman Rights and Responsibilities Act  2006 (Vic) states that every  person has the right to  enjoy human rights \nwithout discrimination, and every  person is equal before the/uni00A0law.\nUnfortunately, however, sometimes situations arise where a person is discriminated. This was \ndemonstrated in 2017 when a person was  refused a booking through online hospitality service Airbnb. If  \nsomebody is discriminated against because of a particular attribute, such as when using Airbnb, then he or she may have  a claim against the person or company that has discriminated against him or/uni00A0her. discrimination \nthe unfavourable treatment of a person based on a certain attribute (e.g. age, gender, disability, ethnicity, religion or sexuality).

Some of  \nthese statutes are  Victorian statutes, which means that they only apply to  acts or omissions that occur \nin Victoria, whereas others are  Commonwealth statutes, which means that they apply all over  Australia.\nThe Equal Opportunity Act  2010 (Vic) is the main legislation in Victoria that makes discrimination \nunlawful. It prohibits discrimination based on attributes (which are  set out in Section 6 of the Act) such \nas age,  breastfeeding, gender identity, disability, lawful sexual activity, marital status, pregnancy and race \nin areas such as employment, education, goods and services, accommodation, membership and/uni00A0sport.Airbnb  host  cancels  \nbooking\nIn 2017, Dyne Suh from southern California \nclaimed she was refused an Airbnb \nbooking at the last minute because she was Asian.

It also prohibits employers from taking adverse action against an employee because of these attributes.\nSource 2 Victorian and Commonwealth statutes that prohibit discrimination\nThe main purpose of anti-discrimination laws is to protect \npeople against victimisation, unfair and unwarranted judgment, \nvili\ufb01cation and persecution.

Did you/uni00A0know?Elements required to/uni00A0establish liability\nAlthough various Acts of Parliament (both federal and state) deal with discrimination, there are some \ncommon elements that need to be established for the discrimination claim to succeed. To establish discrimination, the following elements must be proven:\n\u2022 the discrimination was based on a certain attribute \u2022 the discrimination took place in a particular area \u2022 the discrimination caused harm or less favourable treatment.\nElement 1  \u2013 The discrimination was based on/uni00A0a certain \nattribute\nThe person making the complaint must \ufb01rst establish that the discrimination that he or she su\ufb00ered was \nbecause of a certain attribute. The attributes are di\ufb00erent in each statute and some statutes focus on very speci\ufb01c attributes. The attributes set out in the Equal Opportunity Act are summarised in Source 4 below.\nAge BreastfeedingEmployment\nactivityGender identity\nLawful sexual\nactivity \nRace Religious belief\nor activity Sex Sexual\norientationAn expunged\nhomosexual\nconvictionDisabilityIndustrial\nactivity\nMarital status Parental or\ncarer status Physical\nfeaturesPolitical belief\nor activity Pregnancy\nPersonal\nassociation\nwith a person\nwith any of\nthese attributes\nSource 4 Attributes set out in the Equal Opportunity/uni00A0Act\nIf a person is hurtful to another simply because he or she doesn\u2019t like them, but it is not based on any \nattribute, then it is unlikely to be able to become a discrimination/uni00A0claim.\nThe Equal Opportunity Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in relation to the above attributes on the \nbasis that they should not be relevant in certain circumstances. For example, if two people are applying for the same job as a lawyer, and one is female and one is male, then there should be no reason why the gender of the person is a relevant factor when employing them. Similarly, if one person is Muslim and the other person is a Bah\u00e1\u2019i, and they are both members of the same football club, their religious belief should not be a factor in determining whether they are chosen to play a/uni00A0game.\nThe legal case below illustrates a claim where the applicants claimed that they were discriminated \nagainst based on age.\nHealth provider refused birth program participation\nWilson v Western Health (Human Rights) [2014] VCAT 771 (1 July/uni00A02014)\nOn 7 November 2011 Tracey Wilson gave birth to a daughter, Sophia, in Sunshine Hospital in Melbourne.

The applicants alleged they were \ndiscriminated against because Western Health decided they were not suitable to participate in its home birth pilot program. The attributes they claimed they were discriminated against, contrary to the Equal Opportunity Act, were Mrs Wilson\u2019s age (she was 44 at \nthe time) and her \u2018great grand multiparity\u2019 (being a person who has had more than 10 children).\nVCAT found that the case for discrimination could not be on the \nbasis of \u2018great grand multiparity\u2019 because it was not an attribute, or had the characteristics of an attribute (that is, it is not a feature that is associated with someone who is of old age, or pregnant, or has some other characteristic that may result in discrimination). Therefore, the case only proceeded on the basis that \u2018age\u2019 was the attribute against which the applicants were discriminated.\nIn relation to Mrs Wilson\u2019s age, VCAT found that the decision that Mrs Wilson was not suitable \nfor the program did not result in her or her unborn baby being treated unfavourably, but on the contrary the decision was in their best medical interests and therefore a favourable one, as it was considered too risky for them to have a home birth with the program. \nThe applicants ultimately failed in establishing their/uni00A0claim.\nElement 2  \u2013 The discrimination took place in/uni00A0a \nparticular/uni00A0area\nThe person must also establish that the discrimination occurred in a particular area or activity.

  "Page 266": "254  UNIT  1 GUILT AND LIABILITYA useful way to get \nan idea of the types of discrimination claims being made is to access the links provided on your obook assess. These human rights websites often report on recent cases or examples of discriminations. This will help you develop your skills to apply the law to a particular/uni00A0case.Study tipA person may be treated less favourably, or may su\ufb00er harm, as a result of either direct or indirect \ndiscrimination:\n\u2022 Direct discrimination is when a person is treated less favourably than another person who does \nnot have the same characteristic or attribute. For example, if a person in school is chosen for a public \nspeaking competition, and another person is not because of their race, then this is direct discrimination. The harm may vary depending on the person, but may include anxiety, or loss of an opportunity.\n\u2022 Indir ect discrimination is when a certain policy, practice, behaviour or condition in a particular area \n(such as in school or at a workplace) results in unfairly disadvantaging someone else. For example, if a sporting club made it a rule that every person who entered a building must \ufb01rst stand and walk up the stairs to say hello to the president of the club, this is likely to discriminate against people with physical disabilities who cannot walk up the stairs. The harm may be a loss of membership because the person didn\u2019t comply with the/uni00A0rules.\nLimitation of/uni00A0actions\nThere is no speci\ufb01c time period set out in the Limitation of Actions Act 1958 (Vic) for a discrimination claim to be made. However, there are some time limits that a plainti\ufb00 needs to be aware/uni00A0of.\nDiscrimination claim under/uni00A0a Victorian statute\nVictorian statutes that prohibit discrimination state that the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission (VEOHRC) (the Victorian complaints body that can provide dispute resolution services in relation to discrimination) may decline to provide dispute resolution services if the discrimination occurred more than 12/uni00A0months before the person complained. This limitation is set out in Section 116 \nof the Equal Opportunity/uni00A0Act.\nHowever, a person can make an application to VCAT in relation to the discrimination, regardless of \nwhether the person has \ufb01rst made a complaint with VEOHRC. \nDiscrimination claim under/uni00A0a federal statute\nThe Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 (Cth) states that a complaint lodged with the Australian \nHuman Rights Commission (AHRC) (the federal complaints body that hears complaints in relation to discrimination contrary to federal statutes) may be terminated if it was lodged more than six months after the alleged acts, omissions or practices took/uni00A0place.\nPossible defences\nA person who is defending a discrimination claim may argue that the plainti\ufb00 has not satis\ufb01ed all of the elements. For example, the defendant may argue that there was no attribute for which the person was discriminated, or it didn\u2019t happen in a particular area or activity, or that the person wasn\u2019t treated less favourably.\nOtherwise, if all of the elements are satis\ufb01ed, then the person responding to the claim may be able to \nrely on one of the following defences:\n\u2022 an exception applied\u2022 an exemption applied\u2022 inherent requirements\u2022 unjusti\ufb01able hardship.\n09_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   254 17/10/2017   2:25 PM",
  "Page 267": "255  CHAPTER  9 OTHER AREAS  OF CIVIL/uni00A0LAW  Defence 1 \u2013 An exception applied\nThere are  a number of exceptions that apply to  persons or companies, which can allow them to  lawfully \ndiscriminate against another. A/uni00A0person facing a discrimination claim may  raise this as a defence.\nExceptions are  usually speci\ufb01ed in the relevant statute. For  example:\n\u2022 an educational authority is able to  set and enforce reasonable standards of dress, behaviour and \nappearance for  students. Therefore, if a school states that a certain standard of  care  must be taken in \nterms of a student\u2019s appearance, a school may  be able to  defend a discrimination claim on the basis \nthat it is enforcing its uniform code\n\u2022 a club is able to  exclude from membership a person on the basis of that person\u2019s sex if membership \nof the club is available only to  persons of the opposite sex. This exception allows female-only gyms to  \noperate without being subjected to  a discrimination claim by/uni00A0males\n\u2022 a sporting club is able to  exclude a person of another sex from participating in a competitive sporting \nactivity if strength, stamina or physique is relevant.\nThe following example further details a situation where this defence could be used.\nDefence 2 \u2013 An exemption applied\nParticular persons or groups are  also exempted from discrimination laws.  For example, a person is able \nto discriminate against another if that discrimination is necessary for  the person to  comply with their \nreligion. As another example, a person can provide bene\ufb01ts to  another person based on age,  but not \nproviding bene\ufb01ts to  a person who is below that age  would not amount to  age discrimination (this is often \nthe case for  retired people who receive certain bene\ufb01ts).\nA person is also able to  apply for  a temporary exemption not exceeding \ufb01ve/uni00A0years if tha t exemption \nis required to  undertake a certain activity. This occurred in 2016 in relation to  Ivanhoe Grammar \nSchool, as it wanted to  target more female students to  improve its gender balance as detailed in the \nnews article below.Accommodation refused to  children\nJuliet runs the \u2018Romeo Hotel\u2019 in Daylesford, Victoria. The hotel is especially designed for  couples \nonly and, because of its  design and location, is unsuitable and inappropriate for  children. Juliet is \nlikely to  be able to  defend a  discrimination claim if one is brought by someone because she didn\u2019t \nlet their children stay  at the hotel.

For example, it is likely to be an inherent requirement of a baggage handler\u2019s job at an airport to be able to lift heavy items. If a person is unable to do this, for example because of their age or disability, then this is unlikely to be discrimination because of the inherent requirements defence.\nDefence 4 \u2013 Unjustifiable hardship\nThis defence is only available to employers. If an employer is facing a discrimination claim by an employee, it could defend the claim on the basis that the working arrangement would cause \u2018unjusti\ufb01able hardship\u2019 on the employer. This means that it would be extremely di\ufb03cult for the employer to be able to accommodate for the employee. For example, if the employer operates out of a particular building that is not accessible to people with disabilities, and adjusting it to allow accessibility would cost a signi\ufb01cant amount of money that the employer does not have, the employer may be able to argue that adjusting for the disabled person would cause it unjusti\ufb01able hardship.\nWhether the defence will succeed depends on an assessment of what is fair and reasonable for the \nemployer to do to make adjustments for the employee. For example, if the adjustments were easy to make and would cost little money, then it is unlikely that the defence will succeed.\nThe role of/uni00A0the law in/uni00A0developing the/uni00A0elements and \ndefences\nVictorian and Commonwealth statute law have largely developed the elements and the defences to a \ndiscrimination/uni00A0claim.However, the school has struggled to attract female students, and in June almost two-\nthirds of its students \u2013 62 per cent \u2013 were/uni00A0boys.\nOn Wednesday the Victorian Civil and \nAdministrative Tribunal granted an application by the school under two sections of the 2010 Equal Opportunity Act, giving it \u2018exemption from prohibitions on gender-based discrimination in relation to education and services\u2019.\nThe decision will allow Ivanhoe Grammar \nto target female students in its advertising and to offer sweeteners to attract girls, including \u2018scholarship and bursary assistance\u2019.\nPrincipal Gerard Foley said the move would \nhelp the school provide a \u2018true coeducational experience for all students\u2019 and promote gender balance in the community.\nSource 7 Ivanhoe Grammar School in Melbourne has obtained an \nexemption to allow them to target female students in advertising.\nSee your obook assess for an example of a case which used the defence of inherent requirements \u2013 Shiraz v Commissioner of Police [2017] FCA 61 (6 February 2017).Study tip\n09_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   256 17/10/2017   2:25 PM",
  "Page 269": "257  CHAPTER  9 OTHER AREAS OF CIVIL/uni00A0LAW Statute/uni00A0law\nVictorian statute/uni00A0law\nCompared to areas such as negligence, discrimination \nlaws in Victoria are fairly recent. It wasn\u2019t until 1977 that the Victorian Parliament introduced the Equal Opportunity Act 1977 (Vic), which prohibited discrimination because of marital status or gender in the areas of employment, accommodation, education and in goods and services. That is, it was limited in the types of discrimination that it prohibited.\nThe main areas of development in Victorian statute \nlaw are set out in Source 8. Statute law has developed to expand the attributes that a person may be discriminated for, to clarify the language around couples (to include same-sex couples) and gender identity (to include those who identify with a particular gender) and to ensure that discrimination against pregnant and breastfeeding women is prohibited.\nCommonwealth statute/uni00A0law\nSimilar to Victoria, it is only in the past 30/uni00A0 years or so that the Commonwealth Parliament has passed legislation prohibiting (banning) discrimination in certain areas. The legislation began with the introduction of the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975. This came about at the end of the White Australia policy (a policy which aimed to prevent immigration by people of certain countries to Australia) when diversity was embraced more than it was before.\nThe Racial Discrimination Act was expanded in 1995 when the Racial Hatred Act 1995 (Cth) amended \nthat Act. It was introduced to prevent o\ufb00ensive behaviour based on racial hatred or because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin (which included the introduction of Section 18C, a section which has recently been under scrutiny).\nFollowing the Racial Discrimination Act, the following legislation was passed:\n\u2022 the Sex Discrimination Act in/uni00A01984\n\u2022 the Disability Discrimination Act in/uni00A01992\u2022 the Age Discrimination Act in/uni00A02004.\nIn 2012, a draft of the Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Bill was released. The Bill proposed to \ncombine the Commonwealth anti-discrimination laws into a single Act of Parliament to make the laws \nclearer and more consistent. The Bill was never passed.\nCommon/uni00A0law\nWhile discrimination laws are largely set out in statutes in Australia, it is the role of the courts to interpret that legislation. One of the main areas of interpretation by the courts is to determine whether certain exceptions, exemptions or defences apply. This occurred in the High Court case of Maloney v The Queen (2013) 252 CLR/uni00A0168.1982 1982 \u2022 Disability was included as an attribute\n1984 1984\u2022 Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (Vic) was passed\n\u2022 Race, religion, ethnic origin, political belief and de-facto\n   spouse status were added as attributes \n1995 1995\u2022 Equal Opportunity Act 1995 (Vic) was passed\n\u2022 Attributes were expanded\u2022 Areas or activities expanded to include sale of   property, sport and clubs\n2000 2000\u2022 Breastfeeding, sexual orientation and gender identity   were added\n2001 2001\u2022 To recognise same sex couples, 'de facto spouse' was   changed to 'domestic partner'\u2022 Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001 (Vic) was   passed \n2006 2006\u2022 The Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act   2006 (Vic) was passed to provide for certain rights such    as equality before the law.\n2010 2010\n\u2022 Equal Opportunity Act 2010 (Vic) was passed\u2022 Direct and indirect discrimination were clarified \nSource 8 The role of Victorian statute law in developing the area of \nlaw in discrimination\nThe Australian Human Rights Commission website states that a 2008 report claimed that one in ten Australians believe that some races are \u2018inferior\u2019 or \u2018superior\u2019 to other races. It also states that a 2014 report found that 18 per cent of Australians said they had suffered discrimination because of skin colour, ethnic origin or religion.Did you/uni00A0know?\n09_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   257 17/10/2017   2:25 PM",

Possible impacts on the plainti\ufb00 are as follows:\n\u2022 Public humilia tion \u2013 This could include degradation or vili\ufb01cation.  For example, a person might tell \nan inappropriate joke in a workplace setting that discriminates against the plainti\ufb00.\n\u2022 Loss of opportunity \u2013 This could occur as a direct consequence of the discrimination. For example, \na female could be denied a promotion based on her gender. \n\u2022 Inconvenience  \u2013 This could occur when accommodation, goods or services are denied. For example, \nan accountant could deny their services to a person of a particular race.\n\u2022 E\ufb00 ect on mental health \u2013 This could include conditions such as depression or anxiety. For example, \na person develops depression as a result of continued discrimination based on a particular attribute.\nImpact of/uni00A0the breach on/uni00A0the defendant\nPossible impacts on the defendant of a discrimination claim are as follows:\n\u2022 Public humilia tion \u2013 This could be a consequence of the publicity of the claim.  For example, the \ndefendant might su\ufb00er public humiliation as a result of widely reported court proceedings.\n\u2022 Loss of business \u2013 This could be a consequence of loss of reputation. For example, a hotel may \nreceive less business because people may not want to support an organisation that they think is being \ndefamatory. \n\u2022 Inconvenience \u2013 This could require the defendant to attend hearings in an attempt to resolve the dispute.

  "Page 272": "260  UNIT  1 GUILT AND LIABILITYVOID MARRIAGES 9.3 \nThe Commonwealth Parliament makes laws in relation to marriage (and \ndivorce), and its laws apply nationwide. In particular, the Marriage Act 1961 (Cth) provides guidelines for people who want to/uni00A0marry.\nMarriage was \ufb01rst de\ufb01ned in the case of Hyde v Hyde and Woodmansee \n[1866] UK LRP&D 130 as a \u2018voluntary union for life of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others\u2019. The de\ufb01nition of marriage has been one of the more debated Australian legal de\ufb01nitions in recent times, in particular in relation to allowing same-sex marriages.\nThe Marriage Act sets out the requirements for a valid marriage. \nSometimes, a dispute arises about whether a marriage is valid, which may require the court to consider whether the marriage is null and \nvoid. This is often called \u2018marriage annulment\u2019 . It is di\ufb00erent to a divorce proceeding \u2013 if a marriage is annulled, then it will be considered to have \nnever existed in the \ufb01rst place. In a divorce proceeding, however, the marriage is recognised as being in existence, but one or both parties wish for that marriage to come to an/uni00A0end.\nThe husband and the wife are normally parties to a proceeding about whether or not a marriage \nis/uni00A0valid.\nRights protected by/uni00A0the/uni00A0law\nThe laws which establish whether a marriage is valid aim to protect the following rights:\n\u2022 the right of free will \u2013 This means that marriage laws require the parties to have given voluntary and \nreal consent, which upholds the right to a person to choose whether they want to marry\n\u2022 the right to a marriage that is exclusive \u2013 This means that marriages in Australia must be to the \nexclusion of others (i.e. monogamous)\n\u2022 the right to be old enough to marry \u2013 This means that both parties must be 18 years of age, unless in exceptional circumstances where the person can be 16 years of age\n\u2022 the right to seek the court\u2019s assistance to make a marriage null and void \u2013 This means that marriage as an institution is protected, and that there are laws about which marriages are valid and which ones are not.\nElements required to/uni00A0establish liability\nIn disputes involving void marriages, there is generally no liability that is imposed on one party. That is, one party generally is not ordered to pay compensation to the other, or there is generally not even an order that somebody is in the wrong. Rather, there is usually an order made by a court that the marriage is either valid, or it is null and void. Sometimes an order that a marriage is null and void is referred to as a \u2018decree of nullity\u2019 .\nSection 23B of the Marriage Act sets out when a marriage might be void. A/uni00A0marriage will be void if one \nor more of the following \ufb01ve elements are established:\n\u2022 the parties were married to someone/uni00A0else at the time\u2022 the parties are within a prohibited relationship\u2022 the marriage was not properly solemnisedmonogamous \nthe state of being married to only one person at a timeSource 1 Marriage was first defined in the English case of Hyde v Hyde and Woodmansee.\nOn 19 December 1922, Theresa Vaughn told a court in Sheffield, England, that since 1917, she had married 61 men (in addition to her first) in cities in Europe, South Africa and England, without ever having obtained a divorce from any of/uni00A0them.Did you/uni00A0know?\n09_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   260 17/10/2017   2:25 PM",

  "Page 277": "265  CHAPTER  9 OTHER AREAS OF CIVIL/uni00A0LAW The role of/uni00A0the law in/uni00A0developing the/uni00A0elements and \ndefences\nBoth common law and Commonwealth statue law have developed the legal principles around marriage.\nStatute/uni00A0law\nBefore the introduction of the Marriage Act, each state and territory was responsible for passing laws \nin relation to marriage. This is because marriage is a law-making power that is shared between the \nCommonwealth and state parliaments, and so the states had the powers (and still do) to make laws \nin relation to marriage. This, however, meant that there was no consistency in marriage requirements across the country \u2013 for example the marriageable age was di\ufb00erent from state to/uni00A0state.\nIn 1961, the Commonwealth Parliament passed the Marriage Act. At the time, it did not include \na de\ufb01nition of marriage. However, it did set out a requirement for the marriage celebrant to explain, at the ceremony, that marriage was the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life, therefore there was some indication in the Marriage Act that marriage was limited to that between a man and a/uni00A0woman. In 2004, a formal de\ufb01nition of marriage was included to make it clear that it did not include same-sex marriages.\nStates have still passed laws that relate to relationships. \nFor example, the Victorian Parliament has passed the Relationships Act 2008 (Vic) which allows people to register domestic relationships, which includes a relationship between two persons who are not married to each other but are living together as a couple (irrespective of gender). However, if the states passed marriage laws that are inconsistent with the Marriage Act, then this is likely to be challenged as being inconsistent with the Marriage Act and the parts of the Victorian law that are inconsistent are likely to be declared invalid (because under the Australian \nConstitution, Commonwealth laws prevail over state laws if they are inconsistent).\nCommon/uni00A0law\nThe Family Court\u2019s role is to interpret the Marriage Act, for example by determining whether a particular marriage meets the validity requirements. This role of statutory interpretation is di\ufb00erent from the role of the courts in other areas, such as negligence, where they have greatly expanded the law. \nFor example, the Family Court has adopted old English law to determine whether there was \u2018real \nconsent\u2019 . In Hirani v Hirani (1983) 4 FLR (Eng) 232, the English Court of Appeal stated that the real question of whether there is consent in marriage is whether the threats or the pressure destroyed the consent of the individual, or overtook his or her will. The Family Court will generally look at previous cases when determining whether the marriage requirements have been/uni00A0met.\nThe case of Attorney-General for the Commonwealth v Kevin and Jennifer (2003) 172 FLR 300 was also \na landmark case, as it involved an issue about whether a marriage between a woman and a female-to-male post-operative transsexual was/uni00A0valid.Australian \nConstitution, the a set of rules and principles that guide the way Australia is governed. The Australian Constitution was passed by the British Parliament and its formal title is the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (UK)\nSource 5 In 2017 a postal survey was conducted about changing the definition of marriage to include same-sex marriages.\nThe Family Court judgments related to the validity of marriage are sometimes short and can provide you with some useful ways to argue a case.

By the time the couple married in 1999, they had lived together for two years and Jennifer had become pregnant using donor sperm and IVF treatment. In 1999, they sought a declaration that their marriage was valid. The couple argued that they were not a same-sex couple and that at the time of the marriage Kevin was a male. The Attorney-General argued that Kevin was not a male for the purpose of the marriage/uni00A0law.\nThe Court accepted that Kevin had presented as a male, was considered a male by family, \nfriends and work colleagues, and had undergone hormonal treatment and surgical procedures to align his physical attributes with his psychological sex. The Court ruled that a person\u2019s sexual status is not linked to their sex at birth to be a valid marriage under the Marriage Act.

  "Page 280": "268  UNIT 1  GUILT AND LIABILITY  ONLINE SHOPPING    9.4  \n  Australians love online shopping. Today, more and \nmore people in Australia are shopping online rather than shopping in traditional stores. More than 40 per cent of Australians buy one or more products over the internet in any four-week period. Online stores such as Amazon, eBay, Groupon and ASOS are among the most popular in Australia.  \n  There are laws in place which aim to protect \nconsumers and vendors in online shopping. These include laws relating to contracts, and consumer laws which aim to ensure that the terms of a contract are fair. Although online shopping is a popular form of purchasing goods and services, it can sometimes go wrong, and a party may potentially have a civil claim \nas a result.  \n  \nRights protected by/uni00A0the/uni00A0law\n  There are two main areas of law that govern online shopping and which give rights to people:  \n   \u2022      contract law, which governs agreements (oral or written) between two or more parties     \u2022      consumer law, which aims to protect consumers and vendors when buying or selling goods and \nservices.    \n  Contract/uni00A0law  \nA  contract  is an agreement or promise (or set of promises) between two \nindividuals or groups that is intended to be legally binding and can be \nenforced by law. A/uni00A0contract can be written or oral, though online shopping contracts are normally in writing (as it generally involves some electronic communication or exchange between the purchaser and the vendor in which there is a record of the agreement to sell and purchase).\n  Online shopping involves a contract between two \npeople or companies. Each time a product or service is bought online, a contract has been made. The contract normally comes into place when a consumer clicks the \u2018I agree\u2019 or \u2018Purchase\u2019 button on the website. Once that happens, Australian contract law may apply to the purchase, just like a purchase that happens in a \nshopping centre.  \n  \nConsumer/uni00A0law\n  Once a purchase has been made, then the purchase may be subject to Australian consumer law, and the \nconsumer will have the same protections as a person who has walked into a store to buy the product.  \nVarious statutes in Australia govern the provision of goods and services. The main law is the Australian \nConsumer Law (ACL), passed in 2011. The ACL promotes and encourages fair trading practices, protects contract law\nan area of civil law governing the validity and enforceability of agreements made between two or more parties\ncontract\nan agreement or promise (or set of promises) between two individuals or groups that is intended to be legally binding and can be enforced through the/uni00A0lawSource 1 Online shopping continues to grow in popularity in Australia.\nSource 2 A contract may be created with a single click on a \u2018Buy Now\u2019 button.\n09_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   268 17/10/2017   2:25 PM",

The \nACL applies to most domestic transactions (where goods or services costing less than $40 000 have been \nbought for personal or domestic use) where the buyer has purchased in a commercial environment (e.g. where the seller is a retailer of goods). It provides various guarantees to the consumer, and the supplier must comply with them. Some of the guarantees that a supplier gives to any purchaser of goods and services include the following:\nGUARANTEES RELATING TO THE SUPPLY  \nOF GOODSGUARANTEES RELATING TO THE SUPPLY  \nOF SERVICES\nThe goods are of an acceptable quality.

Some of the things that can \ngo wrong with an online shopping order are as follows:\n\u2022 the goods never showed up, or the services purchased were never performed, even though the money \nhas been/uni00A0paid\n\u2022 the goods arrived, but they were broken or/uni00A0faulty\n\u2022 the goods arrived, but they do not \ufb01t the description, are not \ufb01t for purpose, or are not of a good \nquality\n\u2022 there was a signi\ufb01cant delay in the goods arriving, or the services being performed.\nIf any one of these occur, the party may have a contractual claim. To establish liability, the plainti\ufb00 will \nneed to establish the following four elements:\n\u2022 a binding contract existed\n\u2022 the contract was breached\u2022 the breach caused/uni00A0loss\u2022 loss or damage was su\ufb00ered.Source 3 Types of guarantees that automatically apply to the purchase of goods and services\n09_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   269 17/10/2017   2:25 PM",
  "Page 282": "270  UNIT  1 GUILT AND LIABILITYElement 1 \u2013 A binding contract existed\nFirst, for a binding contract to exist, there must be a valid contract. For there to be a valid contract, the \nplainti\ufb00 must establish the following three elements:\n\u2022 ther e was an o\ufb00er \u2013 An o\ufb00er is normally some sort of oral statement or act which indicates that an \no\ufb00er is being made. An o\ufb00er must be clearly communicated, and can be withdrawn before acceptance \nas long as the withdrawal is clearly communicated\n\u2022 ther e was acceptance \u2013 Acceptance can also be in the form of an oral or written statement or an act \n(though in online shopping it is normally written through some sort of electronic communication). The acceptance must be in exact terms as the o\ufb00er \u2013 if it di\ufb00ers, it is seen as a counter-o\ufb00er\n\u2022 ther e was consideration \u2013 Consideration is something of value that passes from one party to the \nother. In an online shopping context, the consideration from the supplier to the purchaser is the goods or services, and from the purchaser to the supplier is the money. For example, if Victor purchases an iPhone online for $1200, the consideration from Victor to the business is $1200, and the consideration from the business to Victor is the iPhone.\nFor a binding contract to/uni00A0exist:\n\u2022 ther e must be capacity to contract \u2013 \nThat is, the parties must be 18/uni00A0years old \nor over, though there are a number of exceptions (e.g. where the minor is buying necessities)\n\u2022 ther e must be real consent \u2013 If there is a \nmistake or duress, or undue in\ufb02uence, the contract may be voidable (though this is unlikely to occur in most online shopping purchases, there have been occasions when there has been a mistake)\n\u2022 the contract must be legal \u2013 For example, \nif the online shopping purchase was for stolen or illegal goods, the contract is not/uni00A0valid.\nPurchasers of online goods or services \nshould be aware of the location of the supplier, \nas this can impact on whether Australian law applies.\nElement 2 \u2013 The contract was breached\nWhen a contract is made, an agreement is reached between the parties to carry out a service or supply goods for payment. If one of the parties fails to ful\ufb01l the agreement, then the party can be in breach of the contract. For example, a breach of contract can occur when one of the parties fails to pay for the goods or services, or fails to deliver the goods or services on/uni00A0time.\nFailure to ful\ufb01l any terms and conditions of the contract can lead to a breach of contract. Contract \nterms can include express terms as well as implied terms. Express terms are those that are clearly set out in the contract.

On 15 \nAugust, Intrepid sent her an email to say that the transport and accommodation had not been booked as this usually took 3\u20134/uni00A0days. After checking her finances and realising she could not afford the trip, Joyner requested a cancellation but stated falsely that she had a specialist appointment. She contacted them again the next day and was told she would have to forfeit the entire amount she had paid. The trip was confirmed by email on 16 August/uni00A02016.\nOn 28 August Joyner requested a postponement. This was refused. \nJoyner felt that the refusal to refund any money was in excess of any expenses that would have been incurred by Intrepid, and the cancellation term in the contract was unfair. She sought a full refund or a postponement.\nIntrepid argued that because Joyner booked online, \nshe was aware of the terms and conditions of the contract when she booked. In particular, the terms and conditions stated that they would retain 100 per cent of the moneys if a trip was cancelled 30/uni00A0days or less prior to departure. Intrepid stated it had suffered loss and damage because it had commenced booking accommodation and travel once Joyner had made the booking, and they therefore should retain the amount.\nVCAT found that Intrepid was entitled to the money. \nIt found that she had entered into a contract, and that she had paid the full amount to Intrepid and they accepted this, and that she was not entitled to the money because she changed her mind. The Tribunal found that the cancellation clauses were not harsh or unconscionable, and therefore the application was dismissed.LEGAL  \nCASE\nSource 5 Intrepid Travel was not required to \npay back the money in a case which involved the applicant changing her/uni00A0mind.\nThe legal case below illustrates how contract terms can be contested in court.\nImplied terms are those that are implied at law, or are implied by reason of the conduct of the parties. \nFor example, if an online shopper communicates with the seller that they need the goods before Christmas \nand the seller acknowledges that, the shopper might argue that there was an implied term that the goods would be supplied before Christmas.\nImplied terms at law include the guarantees that are set out in the Australian Consumer Law. These \nterms are not expressly agreed by the parties, but are assumed by the law to be operating in the background. For example, there is a guarantee that the goods will be \ufb01t for purpose. If they are not, then the purchaser can argue that there has been a breach of contract.\n09_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   271 17/10/2017   2:25 PM",

For example, if a person purchased the boxed set of Game of Thrones online, but it never arrived, \nthe purchaser has su\ufb00ered loss of the amount of the boxed set, and the \ufb01nancial loss was caused by the breach of contract by the original purchaser.\nThe defendant could argue that his or her conduct did not cause the loss or damage. In the above \nsituation, if the seller did in fact send the goods to the purchaser, but the set was stolen from the purchaser\u2019s mailbox, then the seller could argue that it did not cause the loss, but rather the theft did (the seller would also argue that there was no breach, as the contract was ful\ufb01lled).\nThe person who has not ful\ufb01lled the contract is only liable for the \ufb01nancial loss that could be reasonably \ncontemplated as likely to result from the failure to perform the contract.

Therefore, if a person wanted to understand the basic legal principles about contract law in Australia, such as when someone has accepted an o\ufb00er, or when an o\ufb00er is considered to be made, that person will need to look at case law rather than statute law to work out those principles.precedent  \na principle established in a legal case that is followed by courts in cases where the material facts are similar.

  "Page 287": "275  CHAPTER  9 OTHER AREAS OF CIVIL/uni00A0LAW Statute/uni00A0law\nThe Australian Consumer Law (ACL) came into force in 2011. It is a Commonwealth statute; however, \nVictoria has passed a law, being the Australian Consumer Law and Fair Trading Act 2012 (Vic), which adopts the ACL so that it also applies to goods and services supplied in Victoria.\nThe ACL replaced the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) as the law which provides consumers with \nprotections. It supplements or adds to the common law contract principles/uni00A0by:\n\u2022 est ablishing consumer guarantees which a supplier must comply with when providing goods or \nservices to a consumer\n\u2022 creating bans on conduct such as misleading and deceptive conduct and unconscionable conduct\u2022 making unfair contract terms void (e.g. a term that creates signi\ufb01cant imbalance between the parties)\u2022 banning speci\ufb01c practices such as misrepresentation, harassment or coercion in the sale of goods or \nservices\n\u2022 providing consumers with the right to seek remedies for breaches.\nThese statutes operate alongside the common law principles of contract law. That is, they do not \nreplace the common law principles, but rather add additional protections or principles that need to be \nconsidered when determining whether there has been a breach of contract. A/uni00A0person claiming breach of contract may simply rely on common law principles of contract law to sue the other party, or they may also claim that there have been breaches of the ACL.\nPossible impacts of/uni00A0the/uni00A0breach\nImpact of/uni00A0the breach on/uni00A0the purchaser\nPossible impacts of a breach of contract on the purchaser are as follows:\n\u2022 Financial loss \u2013 This could include the loss of money used for the goods or services. The purchaser \nmay also indirectly su\ufb00er other \ufb01nancial loss. For example, if the purchaser had bought various goods to make up a special hamper for a birthday present, and one of the key goods for the hamper doesn\u2019t arrive so that the hamper cannot be made up, then the purchaser may su\ufb00er loss beyond the goods that didn\u2019t arrive (though it may not be possible for the purchaser to seek compensation from the seller for all of this loss).\n\u2022 Loss of con\ufb01dence \u2013 This could include losing con\ufb01dence in online shopping. For example, a person \nmay have a bad experience with online shopping and this may deter them from shopping online in the future. \n\u2022 E\ufb00ect on mental health \u2013 This could include conditions such as stress or anxiety. For example, a \nperson may su\ufb00er stress if the goods purchased arrive late. \n\u2022 Inconvenience \u2013 This could include the time and cost involved in making the claim. For example, a purchaser may be inconvenienced by the time it takes for the breach of contract to be resolved.  \n\u2022 Personal injury or death \u2013 This could occur as a result of the breach of contract. For example, a \nperson might buy a washing machine online which then explodes, seriously injuring them.\nSource 8 Impacts on the applicantPhysical impacts\n\u2022 injury or deathEmotional impacts\u2022 Mental illnesses (e.g. stress \nand anxiety)Financial impacts\u2022 Cost of goods or services \npurchased\n09_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   275 17/10/2017   2:25 PM",

  "Page 290": "278  UNIT  1 GUILT AND LIABILITYWORKPLACE PAY AND CONDITIONS 9.5 \nWorkplace laws are essential to the employers and to the \noperation of businesses. They protect the rights of employees in the workplace. Many legal issues can arise from employment situations and can involve issues such as: \n\u2022 underpayment of workers\u2022 workplace safety\u2022 bullying\u2022 discrimination and harassment.\nThe workplace is governed by various federal and state laws, \nwhich are designed to ensure the safety of employees and to \npromote harmonious and cooperative work environments. Many of these laws establish minimum requirements that employers must abide by in relation to an employee\u2019s pay and conditions.\nIn Australia, the main law that governs pay and work conditions \nis the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth). This and associated laws set out \nwhat employees should be paid, and what work conditions they \nare entitled to (e.g. annual leave, sick leave, working hours and lunch breaks). Most employees are covered by the Fair Work Act; one exception is employees who are employed by a state body such as a state electricity/uni00A0body.\nPay and conditions in Australia\nUnder current laws, a person\u2019s pay and conditions can be determined by an award or an agreement.\nAward\nAn award  is a document which sets out the wages that must be paid to a particular occupation or industry. \nThe award will also set out what overtime rates, penalties and allowances will be paid to an employee and the amount of leave the person will receive.\nAn award is often seen as a \u2018safety net\u2019 , because wages cannot fall below the amount set out in the \naward. The Fair Work Ombudsman, a government body which has online information for employers and employees, allows people to \ufb01nd out what their minimum wage/uni00A0is.\nThe minimum wages are reviewed annually by an expert panel of the Fair Work Commission.\nThe underpayment of sta\ufb00 can signi\ufb01cantly a\ufb00ect employer\u2013employee relationships as well as the \nreputation of the organisation.Source 1 Young workers often need greater protection in \nrelation to workplace pay and conditions because they are underpaid more often than older workers.\naward  \nthe minimum wages and conditions that an employer is legally required to pay a worker for a particular job or occupation\nFair Work Ombudsman \na statutory body that promotes harmonious, productive and cooperative workplaces, investigates workplace complaints and ensures compliance with Australia\u2019s workplace laws\nFair Work Commission \nan independent national tribunal that has the power to establish the minimum wages and employment conditions for a particular job or industry\nFast food/uni00A0award\nAnastassia, 16, has started working at a local fish and chip shop as a casual worker.

For  this reason, enterprise agreements are  also commonly known as collective \nagreements. Enterprise agreements e\ufb00ectively replace an award  that is in place and create an enforceable \nset of  terms and conditions of  employment that cover those employees. The  wages  set out in the collective \nagreement must not be below the award  wages,  and are  usually higher than those wages.  The  collective \nagreement must be approved by,  and registered with, the Fair Work  Commission so  that it is publicly \navailable and searchable.\nIndividual contracts\nAn individual contract is an agreement directly between an employer and the employee. Each contract \nis negotiated between the two  parties and sets out the pay  and conditions of the employee. The  wages  \nagain must not be below the award  wages.

The employee stated she had a lack of knowledge about the award and her classification until around September 2014 when she found out about another person\u2019s remuneration at the company.\nThe Magistrates\u2019 Court considered the duties of the employee and found that they satisfied \nthe characteristics of a B.3 Level 3 employee, and therefore she had been properly/uni00A0paid.LEGAL  \nCASE\nLimitation of/uni00A0actions\nUnder  Section 545(5) of the Fair Work Act, a court is not able to make an order in relation to an underpayment that relates to a period that is more than 6/uni00A0years before the proceedings were commenced.\nIf an action is commenced because of breach of contract (i.e. the employee is on an individual \ncontract), then under the Limitation of Actions Act 1958 (Vic), the employee also has six years to recover the underpayment.\nPossible defences\nThere are no defences to a claim that an employee has underpaid an employer. The minimum wages and conditions established under statute law means that an employer must pay that minimum amount, even if he or she believed that the minimum amount did not apply (e.g. the employer believed it could contract with the employee to pay him or her/uni00A0less).\nThe only way in which an employer can defend the claim is by arguing that one of the elements is not \nsatis\ufb01ed. The defendant could argue that:\n\u2022 the plainti\ufb00 was not an employee \u2013 This could mean that the person was a contractor rather than an \nemployee.\n\u2022 the employee had received what they were entitled to \u2013 This means the employee received what they \nwere entitled to under the relevant award or agreement.\n09_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   282 17/10/2017   2:25 PM",
  "Page 295": "283  CHAPTER  9 OTHER AREAS OF CIVIL/uni00A0LAW The role of/uni00A0the law in/uni00A0developing the/uni00A0elements  \nand defences\nStatute law, and in particular Commonwealth statute law, has largely developed work pay and conditions \nlaws. However, the courts were fundamental in establishing what is now known as the modern award system.\nCommon/uni00A0law\nBefore 1900, and before the existence of the Commonwealth of Australia, Victoria had set down minimum wage rates for Victorians for certain industries.\nIt was, however, not standardised until an Australian \ncourt called the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration (now no longer in existence) handed down a decision which established a system of minimum wages. This court had the power to make awards and increase awards. In Ex parte H. V . McKay (1907) 2 CAR 1, the court found that an unskilled male worker needed to be paid fair and reasonable wages for him to be able to live and support his wife and three children, and that a skilled worker should receive an additional margin for their skills. This decision, often referred to as the Harvester Judgment, formed the basis for the minimum wage system which is now in place in Australia.\nBy the 1920s the states had increased their award rates and many workers were covered by the \nminimum wage system. At around the same time, the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration stated in a decision that the basic wage should be increased in line with in\ufb02ation so that the wages could re\ufb02ect standards of living. Over the years, it continued to increase minimum wages depending on the circumstances at the time. Now, it is the role of the Fair Work Commission to determine the minimum wages in modern awards.\nThe courts have also played a role in relation to defences. In particular, the courts have con\ufb01rmed that \nthere is no defence available to an employer who believes that the safety net did not apply when entering into a contract with an individual. This was con\ufb01rmed in ACE Insurance Ltd v Trifunovski [2011] FCA 1204 (25 October 2011), where the Federal Court found that an employer cannot \u2018contract out\u2019 of the minimum wages and conditions \u2013 that is, a person cannot be given less than minimum wages and conditions by entering into a contract, even if the employee is willing to be paid less than the minimum wage.\nStatute/uni00A0law\nThe Commonwealth Parliament has actively passed various pieces of legislation which were aimed at reforming the laws around minimum wages. These included:\n\u2022 the Industrial Relations Act 1988 (Cth), which introduced enterprise agreements\u2022 the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth), which introduced further changes to workplace pay and \nconditions\n\u2022 the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 (Cth), commonly known as Work Choices, \nwhich was a controversial law strongly opposed by many employees and/uni00A0unions\n\u2022 the Fair Work Act, which replaced Work Choices as the law which governed pay and conditions.\nSource 5 Workers in McKay\u2019s factory in Sunshine. The factory was \nthe centre of a case which established the world\u2019s first national minimum/uni00A0wage.\nIn 1896 the Victorian wages boards set the first minimum wages in Australia. The Boot and Shoe Board set a minimum wage of 7 shillings and 6 sixpence per day for adult males, and 3 shillings and 4 sixpence for adult females in October/uni00A01897.Did you/uni00A0know?\n09_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   283 17/10/2017   2:25 PM",

The case \ninvolved a  taxi  driver who had used his mobile phone to  take  \nimages of a  female passenger while she was  in the front seat of \nthe taxi  (including some that were  taken up her skirt). The taxi  \ndriver argued that the conduct did not occur in a \u2018public place\u2019.\nThe court considered past cases which had interpreted the \nwords \u2018public place\u2019, and found that it  has been generally held that \na person in a  motor vehicle located in a  public place is treated \nas being in a  public place. The court also noted that the interior \nof the taxi  can  be seen from the outside, and that the passenger \nphotographed was  a member of the public. It therefore held that \nthe conduct in  the taxi was  conduct that occurred in a  public place. \nThe accused was  convicted. He appealed, but the Court of \nAppeal (WA) dismissed the appeal.

A crime is an act or omission that/uni00A0is:\u2022 against an existing/uni00A0law\u2022 harmful to individuals and society as a/uni00A0whole\u2022 punishable by/uni00A0law.\nFor example, if you were to steal something from a shop, you would be breaking a criminal law because \nyou would be committing the o\ufb00ence of theft (stealing). By stealing, you are causing harm to an individual \n(the owner of the shop) and doing something that is punishable by/uni00A0law.\nAn omission is something you should do, but do not do. For example, if you walked through a shop \nand a scarf became snagged on your bag, you might walk out of the shop with it perfectly innocently. But if you fail to return it as soon as you realise what has happened, you have omitted to do something. That omission can be an o\ufb00ence./uni00A0\nParties to/uni00A0a criminal/uni00A0case\nThere are two parties to a criminal/uni00A0case:\n\u2022 the accused \u2013 i.e. the person who has been charged with allegedly committing the/uni00A0crime\u2022 the prosecution \u2013 i.e. the lawyers responsible for taking a criminal case to court on behalf of the state, \nthe victim and society.In most criminal cases, some person or company has been the victim of the o\ufb00ence committed, \nbut they are not a party to the case.

It is a guarantee to an accused that they will be assumed to be not guilty (innocent), and as far as possible treated as not guilty, until they are proven or plead otherwise (guilty).\nBurden of/uni00A0proof\nThe burden of proof (also known as the onus of proof) refers to the party with the responsibility of proving the facts of the case. In a criminal case, the prosecution holds the burden of proof. \nHowever, in certain circumstances the burden of proof can be reversed; for example, if the accused \npleads a defence such as mental impairment. In this situation the accused has the responsibility of proving he or she was not of sound mind at the time he or she committed the o\ufb00ence.\nStandard of/uni00A0proof\nThe standard of proof refers to the strength of evidence required to prove or succeed in a case. In a criminal case, the prosecution must prove the case beyond reasonable doubt; that is, there must be no reasonable doubt for an accused to be found guilty. If an accused has pleaded a certain defence (for example, mental impairment), then he or she must prove this defence on the balance of probabilities; that is, it is more probable than not that the defence applies.\nSummary offences and indictable offences\nThere are two types of crimes or o\ufb00ences:\n\u2022 summary o\ufb00ences\n\u2022 indictable o\ufb00ences.Summary o\ufb00ences are minor criminal o\ufb00ences that are generally heard before a magistrate in the \nMagistrates\u2019 Court. Summary o\ufb00ences include minor theft, drink driving and minor assaults. The Summary \nO\ufb00ences Act 1966 (Vic) establishes a number of summary o\ufb00ences, as do various other statutes. These statutes also set down what the maximum sanction will be if a person commits that o\ufb00ence.\nIndictable o\ufb00ences are serious criminal o\ufb00ences that are generally heard before a judge and jury in \nthe County Court or the Supreme Court if the accused pleads not guilty. If the accused pleads guilty, there is no need for a jury (as a jury is only required to determine guilt). Many indictable o\ufb00ences are found in the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic). Examples of indictable o\ufb00ences are rape, arson and manslaughter. The case \nof DPP v Trueman [2017] VSCA 24 (on the next page) also provides an example of an indictable o\ufb00ence. \nCertain indictable o\ufb00ences can be heard in the Magistrates\u2019 Court as if they were summary o\ufb00ences. \nThese are known as indictable o\ufb00ences heard and determined summarily. For example, in Victoria a magistrate may hear and determine any o\ufb00ence punishable by no more than 10/uni00A0years imprisonment such as obtaining property by deception or destroying property where the amount involved does not exceed $100 000. The accused must also give their consent to have the case heard in the Magistrates\u2019 Court rather than by a judge and/uni00A0jury.presumption of \ninnocence the right of a person accused of a crime to be presumed not guilty unless proven otherwise\nburden of/uni00A0proof \nthe obligation (i.e. responsibility) of a party to prove a case.

  "Page 322": "310  UNIT  2 SANCTIONS, REMEDIES AND/uni00A0RIGHTSTHE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CRIMINAL \nCASES AND CIVIL DISPUTES10.4 \nThere is some overlap between criminal cases and civil disputes. Some crimes, such as an assault, can \ngive rise to  a criminal prosecution brought by  the state  as well as a civil action brought by  the victim. \nThe di\ufb00erence is that when a crime has been committed, the o\ufb00ender\u2019s actions give  rise to  a court \naction by  the state,  and a sanction (penalty) of some kind. In a civil action, the  defendant\u2019s actions give  \nrise to  a court action by  another citizen, and if successful generally leads to  the payment of money as \ncompensation for  the harm caused.\nIn cases such as defamation and negligence, where this occurs, it is only the more serious examples \nof wrongdoing that are  treated by  the state  as criminal acts. They  are then called, for  example, \u2018criminal \ndefamation\u2019 or \u2018criminal negligence\u2019 because they are  extremely serious.\nKey differences between/uni00A0criminal cases and civil \ndisputes\nIn instances where the same wrongdoing gives rise to  both a criminal case and a civil action, the two  cases \nwill be heard separately and may  be heard in di\ufb00erent courts. The  outcome of one does not a\ufb00ect the \noutcome of the other, but a guilty verdict in the criminal case may  provide a stronger basis for  the plainti\ufb00  \nto succeed in the civil action.\nIt is possible for  an accused to  be found not guilty in a criminal case,  but found liable in a civil case \nrelating to  the same wrong.

The  jury (or magistrate if it was  a summary o\ufb00ence or an indictable o\ufb00ence heard \nsummarily) may  not have  found beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was  guilty.

Even though various laws  are in place which establish crimes \nand sanctions, often crimes are  committed in the community, and a criminal case will need to  be heard \nand determined by  the relevant/uni00A0court. The  role of the court will be to  decide whether the person is guilty \nof the o\ufb00ence, and impose a penalty on that person.\nCriminal cases are  commenced by  the prosecution, who pursues or undertakes the case on behalf  \nof the state.  In Victoria, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) along with the O\ufb03ce of Public \nProsecutions (OPP) prosecute indictable o\ufb00ences. For  summary o\ufb00ences, sometimes an o\ufb03cer \nof the Victoria Police will prosecute the case,  though this depends on the body that is enforcing the/uni00A0law. \nIndictable o\ufb00ences and summary o\ufb00ences are  dealt with di\ufb00erently by  the courts because of their \nseriousness. Yo u  will explore in this chapter the ways  in which they are  dealt with.\nAn accused can be a human being, a company or an association. That  is, there are  some laws  that \nenable a company to  be charged with a crime. These include crimes such as tax fraud and workplace \nhealth and safety o\ufb00ences. It is not possible for  a company to  go to jail, but it is possible for  a director to  \ngo to jail if he or she was  also involved in the crime.\nAn example of a company being charged and receiving a sanction is provided in the case study below.criminal law  \nan area of law that \ndefines a range of behaviours and conduct that are prohibited (i.e. crimes) and outlines sanctions (i.e. penalties) for people who commit \nthem (as opposed to  \ncivil law)\nprosecution \nthe Crown in its role of bringing a  criminal case \nto court (also called \u2018the \nprosecutor\u2019)\nDirector of Public \nProsecutions/uni00A0(DPP) the independent officer responsible for commencing, preparing and conducting prosecutions of indictable offences on behalf of the Crown\nBackpacker  injury  \nresults  in fine  for \ncompany  \nT&R Contracting Shepparton is a  \nlabour hire company that provides \nthe fruit packing industry with backpacker workers.\nIn 2015, an Irish backpacker \nby the name of Annie Dunne was  \ntravelling in Australia.

  "Page 328": "316  UNIT  2 SANCTIONS, REMEDIES AND/uni00A0RIGHTSTHE PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE IN \nCRIMINAL LAW11.2 \nJustice is a word you often hear when people talk about the law \u2013 particularly when it comes to verdicts \nin criminal cases.\nEvery day, newspaper articles, news reports, websites and radio commentators talk about the outcome \nof certain criminal cases being \u2018just\u2019 , while others are seen as \u2018unjust\u2019 . There is even a common saying that \u2018justice delayed is justice denied\u2019 . So, while most people would agree that the criminal justice system should achieve justice, what does \u2018justice\u2019 actually mean?\nIn criminal law, justice can mean di\ufb00erent things to the di\ufb00erent parties or people involved. For \nexample, if a person accused of committing a crime is seeking bail:\n\u2022 the police may think justice is achieved if bail is refused because the accused could be a danger to \nsociety\n\u2022 the victim and his or her family members may think justice is achieved if bail is denied because they have su\ufb00ered as a result of the accused\u2019s actions \n\u2022 the magistrate deciding the bail application may think justice is achieved if bail laws are correctly applied to the accused\u2019s circumstances, regardless of whether bail is granted or refused\n\u2022 the accused may think justice is achieved if he or she is granted bail because they will not be held in custody before pleading, or being found, guilty of the o\ufb00ence.\nTo determine whether justice has been achieved in a particular case, you should consider the following \nthree principles of justice:\u2022 fairness\n\u2022 equality\n\u2022 access.If an objective and reasonable person, after considering all of the factors in the case, and the various \naspects of the criminal justice system, believes that each of those three principles of justice have on the \nwhole been achieved, then it is likely that there has been justice.\nFairness\nIn the criminal justice system, fairness means there should be fair legal processes and a fair hearing or trial. That is, laws should be reasonable, and processes (including investigative, pre-hearing and trial processes) should ensure that people have an opportunity to present their case and challenge or question the other party\u2019s case. A fair hearing or trial also means that the processes used to determine guilt in a criminal case should be objective and without discrimination.\nWe expect laws to be fair. For example, in \ncriminal law we expect that the maximum penalty or sanction for a crime shouldn\u2019t be any more than what society expects for that particular crime. If the penalty was far more or far less, then we may consider that law to be unfair. In a criminal trial, if a person does not have an opportunity to present their arguments to the judge, or they are confronted with compelling evidence which they have seen for the \ufb01rst time at trial, then this would be considered unfair.bail \nthe release of an accused person from custody on condition that they will attend a court hearing to answer the charges\nfairness \none of the principles of justice; fairness means having fair processes and a fair hearing (e.g. the parties in a legal case should have an opportunity to know the facts of the case and have the opportunity to present their side of events; and the pre-hearing and hearing (or trial) processes should be fair and impartial)\nequality \none of the principles of justice; equality means people should be equal before the law and have the same opportunity to present their case as anyone else, without advantage or disadvantage\naccess \none of the principles of justice; access means that all people should be able to understand their legal rights and pursue their case\nSource 1 Is this a fair/uni00A0race?\n11_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   316 17/10/2017   3:30 PM",
  "Page 329": "317  CHAP TER 11 SANCTIONSEquality\nEquality is the second principle of justice. It means that all persons are \ntreated equally regardless of certain attributes or characteristics, such as status, race, religion, sex, or culture.\nIn criminal cases, it means that people should be treated equally before \nthe law, and people should have an equal opportunity to present their case. Laws and processes should not discriminate against another person, and the laws should ensure that another person or body cannot discriminate against another. When a person is accused of a crime, it means that their case should be heard and determined by people who are objective and unbiased, and they should not be treated with favour or disadvantageously.\nIn some circumstances, however, for fairness and equality to be achieved, \na person may need to be treated di\ufb00erently. For example, consider an accused person who has learning di\ufb03culties. Is it appropriate for the accused to be treated exactly the same as the prosecutor who may have no learning di\ufb03culties and would most likely have signi\ufb01cant experience in criminal law and processes? In this situation, for fairness to be achieved, the accused person may need to be treated di\ufb00erently.\nAccess\nAccess is the last principle of justice. Access means that all parties should be able to understand their legal rights, and should have the right and opportunity to use the institutions, processes and systems that are used for criminal cases. This not only includes access to the courts, but also to all of the institutions and people that provide legal information, advice and representation, and to information about a person\u2019s rights. It also means that victims should get access to information about the criminal case, including information about the hearing dates, whether the accused has pleaded guilty, or about the release date of the prisoner if the o\ufb00ender was imprisoned.\nAustralia\u2019s legal system is often criticised for failing to provide adequate access to justice to many \ngroups within our society. One of the biggest reasons for this is because our legal system is considered to be too expensive, and only accessible to those who are able to a\ufb00ord/uni00A0it.\nThe following extract from the Australian Bar Association website provides further insight into the \nprinciple of access.\nAustralian Bar \nAssociation the main organisation that represents barristers in Australia. It aims to promote the rule of law and advocates for fair and equal access to justice for allKeep each of these three principles in mind when exploring the topics in Unit 2./uni00A0In the margin of your notes, make a comment when you see one of these principles touched on. The more you are able to apply each of these three principles to actual cases, the more you will be able to understand what they/uni00A0mean.\nStudy/uni00A0tipSource 2 In 1955, an African-American woman by the name of Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger on a public bus. This was a key event in the struggle for civil rights. At this time in America, African-Americans were not treated equally by the law. \nAccess to justice\nIt is a key priority area of the Australian Bar Association to advocate for fair and equal access \nto justice for all. The concept of fair and equal access to justice requires that, regardless of means, all people have access to high quality legal services or effective dispute resolution alternatives necessary to protect their rights and interests. Fair and equal access to justice also requires that all people, regardless of race, ethnic origins, gender or disability, are entitled to equal opportunities before the law, and in employment, education and other sectors and services within our society.\nSource:/uni00A0Australian Bar Association, Access to JusticeEXTRACT\n11_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   317 17/10/2017   3:30 PM",

As at 30 June 2016, there were 18 146 members of \nthe police force, which includes its Chief Commissioner, deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners and various ranking police o\ufb03cers such as constables, sergeants and senior sergeants.\nThe role of Victoria Police is to serve the Victorian community and uphold the law to promote a \nsafe, secure and orderly society.\nVictoria Police is the main institution that enforces criminal law relating \nto indictable o\ufb00ences and most summary o\ufb00ences in Victoria.

These are normally undertaken by police prosecutors who are specialised in conducting these cases. For indictable o\ufb00ences, the police will undertake the investigations, gather the evidence and charge the accused persons. The information gathered will then be given to the O\ufb03ce of Public Prosecutions (OPP) who will be responsible for the prosecution in/uni00A0court.\nFrom January to December 2016, there were 552 005 o\ufb00ences recorded by Victoria Police.In 1924 women were \nallowed to be sworn members of Victoria Police. However, it was not until 1972 that married women were allowed to join the force.

The  AFP consists of  a Commissioner of  Police, deputy commissioners, AFP \nemployees, special members and special protective service o\ufb03cers.\nThe role of the AFP is to  investigate and enforce o\ufb00ences that have  a federal aspect. O\ufb00ences that \nhave  a federal aspect include those o\ufb00ences that are  against the law  of the Commonwealth or a territory. \nFor example, the Commonwealth Criminal Code establishes a number of Commonwealth o\ufb00ences. The  \nAFP is able to  enforce the Commonwealth Criminal Code and investigate any  breaches of that Code. \nThe AFP is provided with various powers to  enforce criminal law.  For example, protective service \no\ufb03cers have  the power to  arrest a person without a warrant and conduct searches of a person. \nDepending on the nature of the o\ufb00ences, the AFP may  work  with Victoria Police or other investigative \nagencies (including other state  police forces) to  identify and arrest possible o\ufb00enders, as illustrated in the \nfollowing case study.Source 2 The \ninvestigation of possible terror attacks, and response to  \nterror-related emergencies, are roles played by the Australian Federal Police/uni00A0(AFP).\nTerror  raids  involve  AFP  and Victoria  Police  \nOn 23 December  2016,  four  men were  charged  over an  alleged  plan  to attack  Federation  \nSquare,  Flinders Street Station and St  Paul\u2019s  Cathedral.

These bodies are known as delegated bodies because they are delegated (or given) power by the parliament to make and/or enforce/uni00A0laws. \nThe power to enforce criminal law is given by an Act of Parliament, which will specify who has \nthe power to enforce the law. For example, Section 48 of the First Home Owner Grant Act 2000 (Vic) gives power to the Commissioner of State Revenue to impose a penalty if a person has been dishonest when obtaining a \ufb01rst home owner grant (being a payment to a person who buys their \ufb01rst home and who is eligible for a payment by the Government to help them buy their home).\nVictorian delegated bodies\nDelegated bodies in Victoria that have the power to enforce criminal law are listed in Source 6.delegated/uni00A0body \nan authority or agency given power by the Victorian Parliament to make and/or enforce laws\nAct of Parliament \na law made by parliament; a bill which has passed through parliament and has received royal assent (also known as a statute)\nDELEGATED BODY DESCRIP TION\nConsumer Affairs \nVictoriaConsumer Affairs Victoria can take action in relation to breaches of consumer trading laws and tenancy laws.\nEnvironmental Protection Authority/uni00A0(EPA)The EPA has the power to investigate breaches of environmental laws and commence proceedings for offences committed in relation to the environment.\nLocal councils Local councils govern at a local level and have the power to enforce local laws where a local law makes an act or an omission a criminal offence.\nState Revenue Office/uni00A0(SRO)SRO is Victoria\u2019s tax collection agency and administers laws relating to taxes, duties and levies.

The  Occupational Health and Safety Act  is the main statute in Victoria \nwhich aims to  ensure the health, safety and welfare of employees and other \npersons at  work. Laws  that regulate safe  work  conditions are  designed to  \nensure that workers are  protected, and do not feel their safety is at  risk \nwhen working. These laws  also ensure that businesses do not have  to pay \nthe \ufb01nancial costs that are  associated with having unsafe practices.\nOne of the functions of WorkSafe Victoria is to  monitor and enforce \ncompliance with the Occupational Health and Safety Act  and other statutes \nsuch as the Dangerous Goods Act  1985 (Vic). Various sections of these and \nother statutes make it a criminal o\ufb00ence if  that section is not complied/uni00A0with.\nFor example,  Section  21 of the  Occupational  Health  and Safety  Act \nimposes  a duty  on an employer  to provide  and  maintain  a working  \nenvironment  that is  safe  and  without  risks  to health  (as shown in  the \nextract  below).\nIn many prosecutions, WorkSafe will work  with the OPP to  prosecute the matter. This will normally \nmean that WorkSafe will investigate the breaches and prepare the evidence, but the preparation and \nconduct of the hearings will be conducted by  the OPP. This is a result of a memorandum of understanding \nentered into between WorkSafe and the OPP which regulates the management of prosecutions.\nThe following case study highlights a tragic incident in relation to  occupational health and safety.\nSwanston  Street  wall  collapse\nIn March 2013, a  tragic incident occurred in Melbourne, Victoria, when a  15m section of \na brick/uni00A0wall tumbled from a  former brewery site in Swanston Street.

They govern at a local level, and make laws and ensure compliance with laws in their geographical area. Each local area has di\ufb00erent needs, and local councils should be aware of the needs of the people in their local/uni00A0area.\nThere are 79 di\ufb00erent local councils in Victoria. They have been given authority by the Victorian \nParliament under the Local Government Act 1989 (Vic) to make and enforce local laws, often called by-laws , \nfor their own local district. These include laws relating to building and planning permits, childcare centres, rubbish and local libraries.\nFor example, the General Purposes Local Law 2015 is a law passed by Maribyrnong City Council. \nSection 13 of that law makes it an o\ufb00ence for a person to consume alcohol or be in possession of alcohol, other than in a sealed container, on a road or council land. The penalty for committing that o\ufb00ence is 20 penalty units. If that law is broken, the Maribyrnong City Council could enforce the law/uni00A0by:\n\u2022 warning the person who has breached the/uni00A0law\u2022 directing the person to cease the activity\u2022 issuing an infringement/uni00A0notice\u2022 commencing legal proceedings.\nIn addition to local laws, there are certain Victorian statutes which give the power to local councils \nto enforce the law if there has been an o\ufb00ence committed. For example, the Food Safety Act 1984 (Vic) \nestablishes a number of o\ufb00ences in relation to food handling. The purpose of establishing these o\ufb00ences \nis to ensure that food for sale is safe and suitable for human consumption. The Food Safety Act gives power to a council to bring proceedings for o\ufb00ences under the/uni00A0Act.\nThe following legal case is an example of a food safety o\ufb00ence.by-laws \nlocal laws or regulations made by local councils that apply to residents in local/uni00A0areasAussie Signs also pleaded guilty to one charge \nmade under Section 23 of the Occupational Health \nand Safety Act .

These come through various sources \nof law, including statute law. For example, the Victorian Parliament has passed the Equal \nOpportunity Act 2010 (Vic), which is designed to protect people from discrimination, sexual \nharassment and victimisation.\nRights are also given to people who are suspected or accused of committing a \ncrime, and people who are guilty of crimes. \nFor example, every accused has the right to be presumed innocent until proven \nguilty. This is a right that is recognised internationally (through documents such as the \n1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) and protected in Victoria by \nthe Human Rights Charter (i.e. the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities/uni00A0Act 2006 \n(Vic)), a statute which protects and promotes human rights in Victoria.\nOn the other hand, investigative and prosecution agencies such as Victoria Police and \nthe OPP have powers to enable them to investigate crime and bring o\ufb00enders to justice. \nThe powers given to these bodies to carry out their job of enforcing the law are sometimes referred to as institutional powers. They include powers such as gathering \ufb01ngerprints, charging an accused and initiating criminal proceedings against an accused.\nThose powers, however, must be balanced against the rights of individuals. If institutions have too \nmuch power, individuals may be unjustly treated. However, if their powers are too few or too limited, crime prevention and law enforcement can become di\ufb03cult or almost impossible.\nIn this topic you will explore how institutional powers are balanced against individual rights in the \nfollowing stages of a criminal case:/uni00A0arrest, questioning, bail, court proceedings and the imprisonment of the o\ufb00ender.

The power of arrest, with or \nwithout a warrant, is found in the Crimes Act (the main provisions are Sections 458 and 459 of that Act). Most arrests are made without a warrant.\nPolice can arrest without a warrant any person found committing an o\ufb00ence if the police believe it is \nnecessary/uni00A0to:\n\u2022 ensure the appearance of the o\ufb00ender in/uni00A0court\u2022 preserve public/uni00A0order\u2022 prevent the continuation or repetition of an o\ufb00ence or the commission of a further o\ufb00ence\u2022 ensure the safety or welfare of the public or the o\ufb00ender.A member of the public \ncan arrest another person if that person is found committing an offence and the arrest of the offender is necessary.

Police can use reasonable force when making an arrest, though what is reasonable force will \ndepend on the circumstances of the arrest.\nAn individual, however, has certain rights in relation to  an arrest, which ensures a balance between the \npower of arrest and the rights of an individual.

The decision to grant or refuse bail is \nnormally determined by either a court, a bail justice or a police o\ufb03cer, depending on the circumstances. \nA person is entitled to bail in certain circumstances. In particular, the Bail Act states that any person \naccused of an o\ufb00ence and is held in custody in relation to that o\ufb00ence shall be granted bail (subject to \ncertain exceptions):\n\u2022 within 24 hours after he or she is taken into custody if it is not practicable to bring the person before a \nbail justice or the Magistrates\u2019/uni00A0Court\n\u2022 during any postponement of the hearing of a charge for the o\ufb00ence or while awaiting/uni00A0trial\n\u2022 wher e the case has been adjourned or when awaiting sentence (except where the court does not \nconsider it desirable).However, the right to bail and the right to apply for bail are balanced by powers given to the prosecutor \nto oppose bail, and to the person deciding on bail to refuse bail or impose certain conditions. The \nprosecutor can also apply to revoke (i.e. cancel)/uni00A0bail.\nBail must be refused in certain circumstances; including where the person has been charged with \ncertain o\ufb00ences such as murder, or where the court is satis\ufb01ed there is an unacceptable risk that the accused if released on bail would fail to surrender into custody when it is time to do so, commit an o\ufb00ence, endanger the public or interfere with witnesses or the course of justice. The ability of an accused person to be released on bail has been made more di\ufb03cult after the passing of legislation in 2017 by the Victorian Parliament which amends the Bail Act. These amendments came about following the tragic incident in Bourke Street, Melbourne, in January 2017 which resulted in the death of six people and the injuries of many more. The person charged with the crimes was on bail at the/uni00A0time.\nConditions that can be imposed as part of bail include the requirement that the accused report to a \npolice station, reside at a particular address, not contact speci\ufb01ed persons, surrender his or her passport or not drive a motor vehicle.\nCourt proceedings\nAs you have learnt, many bodies have power to enforce the law. Along with that power is the power to commence criminal action against an accused for the purposes of obtaining a guilty verdict (or plea) and to punish the o\ufb00ender for his, her or its actions.\nFor summary o\ufb00ences, the Magistrates\u2019 Court will hear and determine the charges and the magistrate \nwill decide on guilt. For indictable o\ufb00ences, the Magistrates\u2019 Court will determine whether there is evidence of a su\ufb03cient weight to support conviction at trial (through procedures known as the committal proceeding) before the matter is then transferred to either the County Court or Supreme Court for pre-trial procedures and, eventually,/uni00A0trial.\nVarious powers are given to the prosecutor as part of the proceedings. Prosecutors have the power to \nprepare the case, speak with witnesses, obtain evidence and negotiate with the accused (or his or her legal practitioners) about an early guilty/uni00A0plea.\nIn those proceedings, however, the accused also has certain rights. Many of those rights are protected \nby the Human Rights Charter, and include the right/uni00A0to:\n\u2022 ha ve the charge or proceeding decided by a competent, independent and impartial court after a fair \nand public hearing\n\u2022 be presumed innocent until proven/uni00A0guilty\u2022 be informed promptly and in detail about the nature and reason for the/uni00A0chargeconviction \na criminal offence that has been proved.

Y ou will learn more about imprisonment later in this chapter, but imprisonment aims to protect the community as well as punish o\ufb00enders by depriving them of their liberty.\nIf the maximum penalty for a crime is a term of imprisonment, and the court considers it the most \nappropriate sentence, then the court has the power to imprison the person for a period of time. Once that occurs, Corrections Victoria, which is a business unit of the Victorian Government\u2019s Department of Justice & Regulation, will oversee the detention of the o\ufb00ender.\nThe management of prisons is governed by the Corrections Act 1986 (Vic). That Act provides prison \no\ufb03cers with various powers to enable them to manage prisons. These include the power to search and examine any person, seize unauthorised goods, arrange for medical tests for alcohol or drugs, or require a prisoner to be electronically monitored. It also includes other powers such as the power to open, inspect and read a letter sent to a prisoner.\nHowever, every prisoner has certain rights \nunder Section 47 of the Corrections/uni00A0Act:\n\u2022 the right to be in the open air for at least an \nhour each day (weather permitting)\n\u2022 the right to be provided with adequate food and, where necessary, special dietary food (for example, where the prisoner is vegetarian or has religious beliefs)\n\u2022 the right to be provided with suitable clothing\n\u2022 the right to have access to reasonable medical \ncare and treatment as well as reasonable dental treatment\n\u2022 if  the prisoner is intellectually disabled or \nmentally ill, the right to the appropriate special care and treatment\n\u2022 the right to practice a religion, which includes the right to join with other prisoners to practice that religion (so long as it does not jeopardise prison security)\n\u2022 the right to receive at least one half-hour visit \na/uni00A0week.legal/uni00A0aid \nlegal advice, education or information about the law and the provision of legal services (including legal assistance and representation)\nimprisonment \na sanction that involves the removal of the offender from society for a stated period of time and placing them in prison\nSource 6 HM Prison Barwon is a high risk and maximum security prison for males in Victoria.\n11_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   329 17/10/2017   3:31 PM",

Proceedings were commenced through a litigation guardian (a person who commences proceedings on behalf of children). One of the \nissues raised was that the decision to transfer the children was contrary to certain rights under the Human Rights Charter, including the right of children to be protected from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Evidence was given about the conditions at Barwon Prison, which included long periods of confinement in cells meant for adults, fears and threats by staff and lack of space. \nThe children were successful in challenging \nthe transfer decision in 2016. Despite an appeal, the Court ordered that the children be removed by 30/uni00A0December/uni00A02016.\nThe Victorian Government ultimately issued new \ndirections which meant that the children remained at Barwon Prison, and two other children were transferred there. A/uni00A0proceeding was again issued in the Supreme Court of Victoria, which was heard in April 2017. Judgment was handed down by Justice Dixon on 11 May 2017, who held that the directions were incompatible with human rights afforded under the Human Rights Charter, and the transfer of the two children was unlawful.

Generally,  state courts  deal  with  \nissues  arising  under  state law,  and federal  courts deal  with  issues  arising  under  federal/uni00A0law.\nThe courts  in the Australian  court system  are ranked  in a hierarchy  with  the higher  courts  hearing  \nthe more serious  and complicated  cases,  and the lower  courts  dealing  with  minor  issues.\nReasons for/uni00A0a court hierarchy\nThere  are four  main  reasons  for ranking  the courts  in a hierarchy:\n\u2022 T he court  hierarchy  allows  for specialisation  or expertise , with  the courts developing  expertise  \nin dealing  with  the types  of cases  that come  before  them.  For example,  the Magistrates\u2019  Court  \nhears  minor o\ufb00ences,  and so will be specialised  in o\ufb00ences  such  as drink  driving.  \n\u2022 T he court  hierarchy  enables  the parties  to a court  case  to appeal  to a higher  court  if they  are not \nsatis\ufb01ed  with  the decision  in a lower  court.  This  means  that a person who  believes  that an  error \nhas been  made  in the lower  court  can appeal  the case  to a higher  court  for the higher  court  to \nreview  that decision.\n\u2022 T he court  hierarchy  is a necessary  part  of the  doctrine  of precedent  (law-making  through  \ncourts)  because the  process  of law-making  through  courts depends  on a decision  being  made  in a \nhigher  court  which  is binding  on lower  courts.  \n\u2022 F inally,  a court  hierarchy  allows  for administrative convenience . Because  the courts  have  \ndi\ufb00erent  jurisdictions  to hear di\ufb00erent  matters, it  allows  smaller  and minor  cases  (of which  there  \nare more)  to be heard  in the Magistrates\u2019  Court  (of which  there  are a number  in the state),  and  \nmore complex  and larger  cases  to be heard  in the County Court  and the Supreme  Court.  appeal \nan application to  have \na higher court review a ruling (i.e. decision) made by a lower  court\ndoctrine of precedent the common law principle by which the reasons for the decisions of higher courts are binding on courts ranked lower  \nin the same hierarchy in cases where the material f\nacts are \nsimilar\njurisdiction \nthe lawful authority (i.e. power) of a court, tribunal or other dispute resolution body to decide legal cases\nSource 1 The court hierarchy in Victoria and AustraliaHigh Court of Australia\nFederal Court \nof Australia\nFederal Circuit \nCourt of AustraliaFamily Court \nof Australia\nSupreme Court (Trial Division)\nCounty Court of Victoria\nMagistrates\u2019 Court of Victoria\nCoroners \nCourtChildren\u2019s\nCourtFederal courts\nVictorian courtsSupreme Court (Court of Appeal)\n11_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   332 17/10/2017   3:31 PM",

If an accused continues to plead not guilty, then his or \nher guilt will be determined at a hearing in the Magistrates\u2019 Court for a summary o\ufb00ence, or at a trial in the County Court or Supreme Court for an indictable o\ufb00ence. A/uni00A0judge or magistrate will oversee the trial.

Several stages occur during committal proceedings.

If the accused pleads not guilty, the hearing at which guilt is determined is known as a/uni00A0trial.\nAppellate jurisdiction\nCriminal appeals can be heard from the Magistrates\u2019 Court against a conviction or sentence. This means that people can appeal to the County Court if they think they have been wrongly convicted and no reasonable magistrate would have convicted them on the facts presented in the case, or their sentence was too harsh. The DPP can also appeal on the basis of the sentence being too lenient.\nThe Supreme Court (Trial Division)\nOriginal jurisdiction\nThe Trial Division of the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to hear all indictable o\ufb00ences, but generally hears those most serious indictable o\ufb00ences not able to be heard by the County Court, such as treason, murder and attempted murder. If the accused pleads not guilty, the hearing at which guilt is determined is known as a/uni00A0trial.\nAppellate jurisdiction\nThe Trial Division can hear criminal appeals from the Magistrates\u2019 Court that are made on a question of law. An appeal on a question of law occurs when the application of the law in the case is in question. For example, an appeal can be made on a question of whether the magistrate incorrectly applied the law when determining whether an o\ufb00ence was committed.\nThe Supreme Court (Court of/uni00A0Appeal)\nThe Court of Appeal has no original jurisdiction. It hears appeals from the County Court and Supreme Court, which are usually determined by three justices. These appeals may question a conviction, the severity or leniency of a sentence or a question of law. Leave (consent) of the Court of Appeal is required for the o\ufb00ender, but no leave is required for the DPP to appeal to the Court of Appeal against a sentence imposed.\nAny further appeals from the Court of Appeal would be heard by the High Court of Australia, which is \nthe \ufb01nal appeal court.

  "Page 350": "338  UNIT  2 SANCTIONS, REMEDIES AND/uni00A0RIGHTS11.6 THE ROLE OF THE JURY IN \nA/uni00A0CRIMINAL/uni00A0TRIAL\nIn Australia, the jury system is sometimes used to determine whether a person is guilty of an o\ufb00ence.\nThe jury system began in medieval Europe around 1215. Before this time, the way in which a person\u2019s \nguilt or innocence was determined was by trial by ordeal. This involved subjecting the accused to some \nsort of experience (i.e. ordeal), after which time his or her guilt or innocence was declared. For example, an ordeal by water involved throwing the accused into a river or lake. If the accused sank, he or she was taken out of the water and presumed innocent. If they \ufb02oated, they were considered guilty.\nTrial by ordeal was abolished in 1215. By this time a trial by jury had started to become more \ncommon. A trial by jury is a trial by peers in which an impartial group of people are randomly selected to hear the evidence and hand down a verdict as to whether the accused is guilty or not guilty. \nWhen are criminal juries/uni00A0used?\nCriminal juries are used in the original jurisdiction of the County Court and Supreme Court. That is, criminal juries are used to determine the guilt of an accused person who is charged with an indictable o\ufb00ence.\nJuries are never used in the Magistrates\u2019 Court and are not used in appeals. Juries are also not used \nwhen an o\ufb00ender has pleaded guilty, because its only role is to determine guilt or innocence, and not the sanction.\nThe Juries Act 2000 (Vic) governs the selection, composition and role of a jury in Victoria. The Jury \nDirections Act 2015 (Vic) is also an important statute which establishes the way in which jury directions are to be given to a jury by a judge (being instructions about the law or about the way that certain evidence should be looked at by the/uni00A0jury).\nComposition of/uni00A0a civil/uni00A0jury\nA jury of 12 is compulsory in criminal cases in the County Court or Supreme Court, where the accused pleads not guilty. Three extra jurors can be empanelled for lengthy trials in case a situation arises where one of the jury members has to withdraw from the trial; for example, if a jury member falls/uni00A0ill.\nThe selection of the jury is random. Persons aged 18/uni00A0years or over who are enrolled to vote in Victoria \nare quali\ufb01ed and liable for jury service. Persons are selected at random and will be sent a questionnaire by the Juries Commissioner (the individual responsible for overseeing the jury system in Victoria) for the purposes of determining their eligibility for jury service. If they are eligible, they will be sent a jury summons requiring them to attend court for jury service at a later date. On the day, people who are summoned may or may not end up on a jury. That is, some people may be excused or challenged to be on a/uni00A0jury.trial by ordeal  \na type of trial common in early medieval Europe which required an accused person to prove their innocence by being subjected to a painful or unpleasant test (i.e. ordeal)\ntrial by jury \na type of trial by peers in which an impartial group of randomly selected people hear evidence and hand down a verdict (i.e./uni00A0decision)\njury directions \ninstructions given by a judge to a jury either during or at the end of trial\n\u2192 GOING FURTHER\nSelection of/uni00A0jurors\nThere are generally four categories of people who will be unable to serve on a duty:/uni00A0ineligible \npeople, people who are excused, people who are disqualified and people who are challenged.In 1994 in the UK, \nfour members of the jury who were staying overnight during deliberations in a hotel room used a Ouija board to conduct a s\u00e9ance about what happened to the murder victims.

It is the judge\u2019s role to explain the law to the jury. The jury considers the evidence \nwith respect to the law and makes its decision.\nA key part of a jury trial is the directions given by a judge to a jury. The Jury Directions \nAct was passed in 2015 with an aim to reduce the complexity of jury directions in criminal \ntrials and to simplify and clarify the issues that juries must determine. In particular, there \nare now legal requirements as to what directions should be given to the jury in trials related to sexual o\ufb00ences and family violence o\ufb00ences. For example, if requested by either party to do so, the judge must give a direction to a jury that family violence is not limited to physical abuse, and may include sexual abuse and psychological/uni00A0abuse.\nSource 1 One of the roles of a jury is \nto concentrate during trial. In 2008, a trial in the Sydney District Court was abandoned after it was found that some of the jurors were playing Sudoku during/uni00A0trial.Ineligible\nSome people are ineligible to serve as jurors because of their occupation. This includes people who \nin the last 10/uni00A0years have worked as governors, police officers, legal practitioners, judicial officers, bail justices, ombudsmen, parliamentarians and public servants employed in law enforcement, criminal investigation, the provision of legal services in criminal cases, the administration of justice or penal administration.\nPeople who cannot understand or effectively take part in the proceedings are also ineligible. \nThese people may have a certain intellectual disability, be a mental health patient, have a physical disability which excludes them from performing the duties of a juror, or they may have inadequate understanding of the English language.\nDisqualified\nCertain people are disqualified from serving as jurors. These people either have a particular type of criminal conviction, or have been declared bankrupt and remain a bankrupt person. For example, a person who is remanded in custody in respect of an alleged offence is disqualified from acting as a/uni00A0juror.\nExcused\nPeople can apply to the Juries Commissioner to be excused from jury duty if they have a good reason. Possible reasons include ill health, excessive inconvenience to get to the court, substantial hardship in attending court, or having to care for dependents.\nChallenges\nIf a person is eligible, not disqualified and hasn\u2019t asked to be excused, then he or she may, on the day summoned to attend court, be taken to a courtroom for the final selection process. At this stage, it is possible for either the prosecution or the accused to challenge a person being on a jury \u2013 either with or without cause. There is no limit on the number of challenges with cause, but there is a limit on the number of \u2018without cause\u2019 challenges (known as peremptory challenges \u2013 a party is given two each).\n11_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   339 17/10/2017   3:31 PM",

During August 2000 in New South Wales, a series of rape attacks were committed against young girls. Bilal Skaf led and orchestrated the attacks. The rape attacks resulted in the conviction of nine men who were involved and a total of 240/uni00A0years in jail for the/uni00A0men.\nOne of the attacks occurred on 12 August 2000, when Bilal Skaf and \nanother man raped a 16-year-old school student in a park in Greenacre, New South Wales. Twelve other men were present at the/uni00A0time.\nThe day before the verdict, the jury went home early. The foreman called \none of the other jurors, and they decided to visit the park. They spent about 15\u201320 minutes there, walked through, and noticed the lighting. The reason for attending the park was that the foreman felt he had a duty to the court to be right, and he wanted to clarify something for his own mind. The lighting was relevant in the case because a key issue was whether the victim had properly identified Bilal Skaf as the man who first sexually assaulted her, and whether he was present when the second man did/uni00A0so.\nAs a result of the jurors attending the park and conducting their own \ninvestigations, the convictions were quashed, and a new trial ordered.LEGAL\nCASE\nSource 3 Gosling Park, where \ntwo jurors conducted their own investigations.

  "Page 355": "343  CHAP TER 11 SANCTIONSTHE PURPOSES OF SANCTIONS 11.7 \nIf society is to keep functioning, and o\ufb00enders are to be adequately dealt with, those who break criminal \nlaws must be penalised in court. \nIn Australia, an o\ufb00ender has the right to be given a penalty that is proportionate to the crime committed. \nThe victims or their families also have the right to see the o\ufb00ender punished for the harm they have done. However, it is possible that each person a\ufb00ected by the outcome will feel di\ufb00erently. An accused who has been found guilty but given a lenient sentence may feel that the outcome is just. The victim may disagree.\nIf an accused pleads guilty or is found guilty, the judge or magistrate will decide on a suitable penalty \nfor the o\ufb00ender. Criminal penalties imposed by the courts are known as sanctions.\nThe law in Victoria which governs sentencing is the Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic). The Sentencing Act sets \nout the purposes for which sanctions (or sentences) may be imposed. \nThe purposes of sanctions are set out in Source 1.\nWhen sentencing an o\ufb00ender, a court can hand down a sentence which achieves one or more of these \npurposes (which is often the case). However, the court must not sentence an o\ufb00ender for any purpose \nother than these \ufb01ve. A/uni00A0court must also not impose a sanction that is more severe than is necessary to achieve the purposes for which it is being imposed. This is known as the principle of parsimony.\nPunishment\nOne of the purposes of sanctions is to punish (i.e. penalise) the o\ufb00ender. This allows victims and their families to seek retribution without taking the law into their own hands. If individuals did take the law into their hands, crime would increase and there would be no social cohesion. Therefore, the courts take it upon themselves to ensure that they seek revenge on behalf of society by imposing a sanction that will punish the o\ufb00ender.\nImprisonment and the deprivation of freedom is the ultimate punishment in our society. Australia no \nlonger uses capital punishment or corporal punishment as a sanction, as these punishments are considered inhumane and unacceptable in the twenty-\ufb01rst century.\nDeterrence\nThe law aims to deter or discourage the o\ufb00ender and others in society from committing the same or similar o\ufb00ences in the future by imposing a penalty that is severe enough that the o\ufb00ender and others can see the serious consequences of committing the crime. There are two types of deterrence:/uni00A0 general \ndeterrence, and speci\ufb01c deterrence. A/uni00A0sanction imposed as a general deterrent is one that discourages people in general from committing the crime, whereas a speci\ufb01c deterrent is aimed at stopping the particular o\ufb00ender who is being sentenced from repeating the o\ufb00ence.\nThe following legal case is an example of the application of deterrence in court.Punishment Deterrence Denunciation Rehabilitation Protection\nSource 1 The five purposes of sanctionsDifferent countries have \ndifferent approaches to sentencing. For example, in 2016 the Indonesian Parliament passed a new law which provided tougher punishments for child sex offenders, including the death penalty, chemical castrations and electronic tracking of released prisoners.Did you/uni00A0know?\npunishment one purpose of a sanction; a strategy designed to penalise (i.e. punish) the offender and show society and the victim that criminal behaviour will not be tolerated\ngeneral deterrence \none purpose of a sanction; a process by which the court can discourage the offender and others in the community from committing similar offences\nspeci\ufb01c deterrence \none purpose of a sanction; a process by which the court can discourage the offender from committing similar offences\n11_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   343 17/10/2017   3:31 PM",

This aim seeks to ensure the safety of society by imposing \na sanction that will prevent the o\ufb00  ender from harming again. An o\ufb00  ender may be required to serve a term \nof imprisonment to remove the o\ufb00  ender from society so that they cannot commit any more harmful acts and ensure the safety of all members of the community. While imprisonment is seen as a sanction of last resort, some o\ufb00  enders are given very long periods of imprisonment because the courts deem them to be a danger to society. The horrendous nature of the crime, the lack of remorse and the o\ufb00  ender\u2019s callous attitude indicate that the person should be kept out of society for as long as possible.\nRehabilitation\nA further aim of sentences is to  rehabilitate  (treat) the o\ufb00  ender. It is in society\u2019s interests to try to help \no\ufb00  enders change their ways, otherwise crime rates and prison costs will escalate. In providing o\ufb00  enders with improved opportunities in the form of education, training, assistance and support (for example, counselling), the legal system hopes that o\ufb00  enders will grasp the chance of a better future, change their o\ufb00  ending ways and become law-abiding citizens.   \nThe following legal case illustrates how the prospects of rehabilitation are considered in court.protection\none purpose of a sanction; a strategy designed to safeguard the community from an offender in order to prevent them from committing further offence (e.g. by imprisoning them)\nrehabilitation\none purpose of a sanction; a strategy designed to reform an offender in order to prevent them from committing offences in the future\n  Excellent prospects of rehabilitation for armed/uni00A0robber  \n   DPP v Edwards  [2017] VCC 354 (3 April/uni00A02017)  \n  The offender pleaded guilty to one charge of armed robbery.

For  example, Section 38 of the Crimes Act  states that the penalty \nfor rape  is 25/uni00A0years maximum in prison. Section 19 of the Summary O\ufb00ences Act  1966 (Vic), which makes \nobscene exposure of a genital area in public place a crime, states that the maximum penalty for  that crime \nis 2/uni00A0years imprisonment.\nThe Sentencing Act  sets out a hierarchy of possible sentencing options.

  "Page 362": "350  UNIT  2 SANCTIONS, REMEDIES AND/uni00A0RIGHTSPurposes of/uni00A0community correction orders\nA CCO is a punishment because it can often impose certain conditions on an o\ufb00ender that are an \nimposition or an annoyance \u2013 for example, the condition to undertake unpaid community work, or have a curfew imposed. A/uni00A0CCO can also serve as a speci\ufb01c deterrent as well as a general deterrent.\nDepending on the conditions that are imposed, a CCO can help to rehabilitate an o\ufb00ender. This is \nparticularly so if the treatment and rehabilitation condition or alcohol exclusion condition is imposed, both of which aim to address the reasons for o\ufb00ending. A/uni00A0CCO can also protect society if the o\ufb00ender is kept busy, is prevented from entering certain areas, or must reside at certain places as part of the conditions.\nImprisonment\nImprisonment is the most serious sanction that can be imposed, and involves the removal of the o\ufb00ender out of society and into a facility known as a jail or prison.\nWhen can imprisonment be \nimposed?\nEach o\ufb00ence has a maximum penalty that can be imposed \nfor that o\ufb00ence. This is set out in the relevant statute. For example, the maximum penalty for murder is Level /uni00A01, being life in prison. Maximum penalties are reserved for the worst examples of an o\ufb00ence; therefore it is rare for an o\ufb00ender to be given the maximum penalty.\nFor \u2018Category 1\u2019 o\ufb00ences committed on or after 20/uni00A0March \n2017, imprisonment is the only option as a sanction.

Deng fell and Majok kept walking. He turned back intending to help Deng. Tragically, a car ran over Deng and killed him. Majok was only 20 years old at the/uni00A0time.\nMajok pleaded not guilty to manslaughter. After two aborted jury trials, the DPP eventually \ncharged Majok with reckless conduct endangering life. Majok pleaded guilty to this offence.\nThe Supreme Court acknowledged Majok\u2019s plea of guilty, his remorse and limited prior \ncriminal history (though noted he was sentenced in 2015 for unrelated matters which occurred between 2013 and 2015). The Court accepted that general deterrence, denunciation and just punishment had a significant role to play in sentencing Majok, but felt that specific deterrence was less important given the mental anguish that Majok had endured and his plea of guilty and remorse. Majok was sentenced to a community correction order for a period of 18/uni00A0months with certain conditions imposed on him, which included the requirement to complete 100 hours of unpaid community work over a period of nine months and to undergo mental health assessment and treatment and rehabilitation.LEGAL\nCASE\nSource 4 Sentencing levels and their \nmaximum term of imprisonment as set out in the Sentencing Act.LEVELMAXIMUM  TERM OF \nIMPRISONMENT\n1 Life\n2 25/uni00A0years3 20/uni00A0years4 15/uni00A0years5 10/uni00A0years6 5/uni00A0years7 2/uni00A0years8 1/uni00A0year9 6/uni00A0months\nSource:/uni00A0Sentencing Act 1991/uni00A0(Vic)The following legal case is an example of the court imposing conditions when sentencing.\n11_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   350 17/10/2017   3:31 PM",
  "Page 363": "351  CHAP TER 11 SANCTIONSConditions of imprisonment\nParole\nParole is an early release from prison. In certain situations (for example, where an \no\ufb00ender has been imprisoned for a term of 2/uni00A0years or more), the court must \ufb01x a \nnon-parole period. This period is the time an o\ufb00ender must serve in prison before applying for parole.\nBeing granted parole is not automatic. The o\ufb00ender must prove to the Parole \nBoard that he or she is worthy of serving the rest of the sentence in the community. \nConcurrent and cumulative sentences\nIf the o\ufb00ender is guilty of more than one o\ufb00ence, more than one sentence may be imposed, and therefore more than one term of imprisonment may be imposed. If that is the case, the court will need to specify whether the terms of imprisonment are to be served concurrently, or cumulatively. \nMost sentences are concurrent sentences (served at the same time). This means that if an o\ufb00ender is \ngiven, for example, three years for burglary, and one year for stealing, he or she would serve three years because the sentences are served at the same/uni00A0time.\nPurposes of/uni00A0imprisonment\nImprisonment, as it removes the o\ufb00ender from prison, serves to both protect the community and punish the o\ufb00ender (by denying him or her of liberty). Imprisonment also generally serves to act as a deterrent (both generally and speci\ufb01cally for the o\ufb00ender), and shows the court\u2019s disapproval of the acts committed. \nImprisonment may lead to rehabilitation, but this largely depends on the circumstances of the o\ufb00ender, \nthe nature of the time served in prison and the support network of the prisoner. The high rate of return of prisoners also suggests that imprisonment is not an e\ufb00ective means of rehabilitating people if they continue to commit crimes. For example, in Victoria, it is estimated that approximately 44 per cent of prisoners return to custody within two years of their release.\nThe ability of/uni00A0sanctions to/uni00A0achieve their purposes\nEven though sanctions are intended to achieve certain purposes, in some cases they may not always be e\ufb00ective in doing so.

They include current sentencing practices, the maximum penalty for the o\ufb00ence, the personal circumstances of any victim, and the presence of any aggravating factors or mitigating factors.\nSome of these factors may help to reduce the \nsentence, whereas other factors may increase the sentence that may be imposed.\nFactors that may \nreduce the/uni00A0sentence\nSome of the factors below may help in reducing the sentence imposed.

This is often because of the resources and time saved by not having to run a trial, and the trauma and inconvenience saved for witnesses and victims. \nMitigating factors Mitigating factors are factors which reduce the seriousness of the \noffence or the offender\u2019s culpability. Examples of mitigating factors include where the offender was acting under duress, prospects of rehabilitation, any personal strain the offender was under, the lack of injury or harm caused by the offence, or full admissions made by the offender.\nLack of prior offending If the offender has not offended before, this is likely to work in his \nor her favour as it may demonstrate a one-off incident or a lack of criminality.\nRemorse If the offender shows significant remorse, then the court may take this into account. Remorse can be demonstrated through an early guilty plea, apologies to victims, early confessions or admissions or full cooperation with investigative agencies such as the police.\nSource 2 Some of the factors that may help in reducing the sentence\n11_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   353 17/10/2017   3:31 PM",

Is it tough on crime, or does it take alternative approaches to \nsentencing that do not always involve punishing the o\ufb00ender?\nThis topic explores aspects of sentencing practices in Victoria and then explores sentencing practices \nin Norway.\nSentencing practices in/uni00A0Victoria\nSentencing in Victoria in the past 10/uni00A0years or so has seen a reduction in the number of sentences available to a court, with the Victorian Parliament passing legislation to this e\ufb00ect. The Victorian Parliament has also passed laws which limit the ability of the court to impose sanctions such as a community correction order instead of imprisonment, leaving imprisonment the only option for some o\ufb00ences. The aim of these changes is to be \u2018tougher\u2019 on o\ufb00enders who commit serious o\ufb00ences such as murder and sexual o\ufb00ences involving children.\nOn the other hand, the courts have sought to adopt a therapeutic approach to sentencing for some \ncrimes by utilising courts such as the Drug Court, the Koori Court and specialist divisions and lists in the Magistrates\u2019/uni00A0Court.\nSentencing options in Victoria\nWithin the past decade, there have been substantial changes to the sentences that can be imposed on o\ufb00enders. As at 1 January 2012, the possible sentences available were as follows:\nSource 1 Sentencing options as set out in the Sentencing Act as at 1 January 2012Drug/uni00A0Court \na specialist court of the Magistrates\u2019 Court which sentences offenders to a Drug Treatment Order where drugs or alcohol contributed to the commission of the offence\nKoori/uni00A0Court \na division of the Magistrates\u2019 Court, Children\u2019s Court and County Court that (in certain circumstances) operates as a sentencing court for Aboriginal people\nSANCTION DESCRIP TION\nDismissals, discharges and \nadjournments\u2022 The release or discharge of the accused person\nFines \u2022 The payment of an amount of money into the court\nCommunity-based orders \u2022 Similar to a CCO, a sentence served in the community with certain conditions \nattached (though fewer conditions may be imposed than a CCO)\nYouth justice centre orders and youth residential centre orders\u2022 The detention of a young offender in a youth justice centre or a youth residential \ncentre\nSuspended sentences \u2022 An order that the term of imprisonment is suspended wholly or in part (that is, \nserved in the community and not in prison)\nHome detention orders \u2022 An order which imposes a sentence of imprisonment which is served at the \nperson\u2019s place of residence\nIntensive correction orders \u2022 A term of imprisonment served by way of intensive correction in the community \nwith strict conditions imposed, including attending a centre for 12/uni00A0hours a week to complete rehabilitation or community work\nDrug treatment orders \u2022 An order given in the Drug Court for drug offenders to undertake a \nrehabilitation program\nCombined custody and treatment orders\u2022 An order that the offender serve a term of imprisonment partly in custody and \npartly in the community where alcohol or drug addiction contributed to the offence\nHospital security orders \u2022 Detention of a person in an approved mental health service\nImprisonment \u2022 The removal of the offender from society and into prison\n11_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   356 17/10/2017   3:31 PM",
  "Page 369": "357  CHAP TER 11 SANCTIONS Since that time, however, several changes have been made in the Sentencing/uni00A0Act. For example:\n\u2022 in 2011, suspended sentences were abolished as an option to the Supreme Court and the County \nCourt for serious or signi\ufb01cant o\ufb00ences committed on or after 1 May/uni00A02011\n\u2022 in 2012, home detention was abolished, and the new community correction order (CCO) was created, which abolished the community-based order, intensive correction order and the combined custody and treatment order. That is, the CCO signi\ufb01cantly expanded so that it could be \ufb02exible to deal with certain types of o\ufb00ences and o\ufb00enders by imposing various conditions\n\u2022 in 2013, the Victorian Government introduced non-parole periods of at least four years for a number of \u2018gross violence\u2019 o\ufb00ences, which meant that for those o\ufb00ences, a court was required to impose a term of imprisonment for that minimum period unless there were \u2018special reasons\u2019 (such as the accused had an acquired brain injury or mental illness)\n\u2022 in 2014, suspended sentences were completely abolished in Victoria for all o\ufb00ences\n\u2022 in 2016, the Victorian Parliament passed legislation which limited the ability of courts to hand down \na sentence other than imprisonment for \u2018Category 1 o\ufb00ences\u2019 . It also restricted the ability of the courts to hand down a sanction other than imprisonment for \u2018Category 2 o\ufb00ences\u2019 , except in certain circumstances.\nIn April 2017, the Opposition Leader Matthew Guy stated that, if elected, his Government would \nintroduce a \u2018two strike plan\u2019 which would mean that o\ufb00enders who commit further violent crimes would \nface tough new minimum sentences. For example, a convicted murderer who has committed a violent o\ufb00ence in the past would automatically face 20/uni00A0years behind bars. If introduced, it would be one of the toughest sentencing regimes seen in Victoria.\nIn 2017, the Victorian Parliament passed legislation which introduced a new standard sentence scheme \ninto the Sentencing Act. The scheme introduces \u2018standard sentences\u2019 for certain indictable o\ufb00ences. A standard sentence is intended to be the middle of the range sentence to be given for the o\ufb00ence based on objective factors. For example, the standard sentence for rape is 10 years. The intention by the Government is to increase the sentences that can be imposed for these type of o\ufb00ences.\nThe above has seen a trend of the Victorian Parliament wanting to be \u2018tough on crime\u2019 by substantially \ncontrolling what sentences can be imposed by the courts for certain o\ufb00ences. For some o\ufb00ences, imprisonment is the only option. Suspended sentences and home detention orders are now not available.\nThis, however, has placed signi\ufb01cant pressure on Victoria\u2019s prison system, as well as pressure on \nCorrections Victoria when dealing with people on community correction orders. It was reported that the number of o\ufb00enders on CCOs has jumped from 5871 in 2013 to 11 730 in 2016, but the recidivism rate of \nthose on CCOs remains over 30 per/uni00A0cent.\nIn addition, many have questioned the e\ufb00ectiveness of prisons as a rehabilitative tool, given Victoria\u2019s \nrecidivism rate which suggests that imprisonment does not deter people from committing crimes/uni00A0again.\nTherapeutic justice\nTherapeutic justice is a term given to a process used in the criminal justice system where underlying health and personal issues are addressed to prevent o\ufb00enders from reo\ufb00ending. It is recognition that a pure punishment approach \u2013 imprisoning o\ufb00enders or sentencing them without considering the causes of crime \u2013 is not e\ufb00ective in changing behaviour and keeping communities safe. Rather, therapeutic justice aims to look at the causes of crime and deal with those causes. It re\ufb02ects the idea that the traditional approach of sentencing and taking a \u2018tough stance on crime\u2019 may not be appropriate for everybody, and that imprisonment is not an e\ufb00ective way of preventing reo\ufb00ending.therapeutic justice \na method used in the criminal justice system to deal with offenders in a way that addresses the underlying causes of crime and seeks to provide offenders with support to avoid further reoffending\nSource 2 The Neighbourhood Justice Centre adopts a therapeutic justice approach.\n11_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   357 17/10/2017   3:31 PM",

LIV president Belinda Wilson said. \u2018Punishment alone does not prevent crime. Addressing the causes of crime prevents crime.\u2019\nContrary to some reports, therapeutic justice does not let offenders off lightly, Ms Wilson \nsaid. \u2018It is not soft justice. In fact it holds offenders accountable for their actions, requiring them to face up to their actions, take steps to repair the harm they have inflicted, and make changes in their lives.\u2019\nTherapeutic justice does however, recognise that crime has a social dimension and \ntakes into account the context and issues that have led to offenders\u2019 harmful behaviour, Ms Wilson/uni00A0said.\nLast year\u2019s report by the Victorian Ombudsman on the rehabilitation of prisoners showed \nthat a large proportion of offenders come from the most disadvantaged backgrounds \u2013 with high rates of poverty, unemployment, family violence, substance abuse and mental health issues.\nTherapeutic justice aims to halt the social and intergenerational aspect of crime by \naddressing its causes and providing offenders with the tools and support to avoid further reoffending.EXTRACTIn the past 20/uni00A0years, Victoria has seen the adoption of some therapeutic justice approaches. These \ninclude as follows:\n\u2022 in 2002, the Drug Court was established in Dandenong Magistrates\u2019 Court. The Drug Court aims to \ndeal with o\ufb00enders who have committed crimes as a result of a drug or alcohol addiction, and aims to place o\ufb00enders on a treatment plan to deal with the underlying causes. Y ou will explore the Drug Court in the next/uni00A0topic\n\u2022 in 2002, the \ufb01rst Koori Court was opened in the Magistrates\u2019 Court in Broadmeadows. The Koori Court is a sentencing court for Aboriginal people, and aims to include the Aboriginal community and views into the sentencing process, which uses an informal atmosphere. Y ou will explore the Koori Court in the next/uni00A0topic\n\u2022 in 2007, the Neighbourhood Justice Centre (NJC) was established in 2007. The NJC attempts to \ndetermine criminal matters by addressing the underlying causes of harmful behaviour and tackling social disadvantage\n\u2022 in 2010, the Assessment and Referral Court List (ARC) was established as a specialist court list in the Magistrates\u2019 Court. It aims to meet the needs of an accused person who has a mental illness and/or cognitive impairment.\nTherapeutic justice approaches are not without critics. Many people believe it is taking a \u2018soft on \ncrime\u2019 approach and results in an increase in criminal activity, not a decrease. In response to some of \nthese critics, in 2017 the Law Institute of Victoria (LIV) issued the following statement.\nLaw Institute of \nVictoria (LIV) the legal body which represents lawyers in Victoria and provides professional development relating to their practice\n11_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   358 17/10/2017   3:31 PM",

Three of these approaches are through the use of the Drug Court, the Koori Courts and diversion programs.\nThe Drug/uni00A0Court\nThe Drug Court was established in 2002 as a division of the Magistrates\u2019 Court. The \ufb01rst Drug Court was located at Dandenong Magistrates\u2019 Court, and a second Drug Court opened in Melbourne in March 2017. The Drug Court deals with o\ufb00enders who commit crimes while under the in\ufb02uence of drugs or to support a drug/uni00A0habit.\nThe Drug Court is intended to respond to the failure of traditional methods of sentencing o\ufb00enders \nto adequately address drug use and o\ufb00ending, by directly addressing the issue of drug and alcohol dependency. It does this by imposing a Drug Treatment Order (DTO) on the o\ufb00ender.\nSource 1 One Drug Court is located at Dandenong Magistrates\u2019 \nCourt.Drug Treatment/uni00A0Order a type of sanction imposed by the Drug Court which aims to treat the underlying causes of offending, and which includes both the treatment and custody of the offender\nSource 2 Magistrate Tony Parsons speaks at a hearing of the Drug/uni00A0Court\nEligibility\nNot every o\ufb00ender is eligible to be sentenced in the Drug \nCourt.

This will involve determining the o\ufb00ender\u2019s location, prior and current o\ufb00ences, whether the drug or alcohol abuse is a signi\ufb01cant factor in committing the crime, and whether the o\ufb00ender is willing to participate.\nThe assessment process will then determine whether \nthe program will be able to address the o\ufb00ender\u2019s behaviour. Once the screening and assessment processes are complete, a treatment plan will be prepared and a DTO will be imposed.\n11_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   362 17/10/2017   3:31 PM",

However, failure to  comply with \nconditions can result in negative actions, such as requiring that the o\ufb00ender perform unpaid community \nwork, or ordering that the custodial part of the DTO  be activated for  a speci\ufb01ed period (but for  no more \nthan 7/uni00A0days). The  intention of imposing a short period of time in custody is to  encourage o\ufb00enders to  stay \non the program, rather than risk the e\ufb00ects associated with time in prison.\nA DTO  can be cancelled if the o\ufb00ender is no longer willing to  participate, or its continuation is not \nlikely to  be e\ufb00ective.

The Drug Court\u2019s sole magistrate Tony Parsons borders on evangelical when it comes to the program. He knows it is not a complete success. Not everyone who starts the program graduates drug and crime free. His argument is that the order is far better than the alternative, which, for those on the program, would be prison.\nOf the roughly 500 who have completed the program, \nabout 19 per cent overcame addiction, and a further 19 per cent greatly reduced drug use and criminal offending. The rest did not complete the order. If that 38 per cent, about 200 people, had gone to prison, it would have cost more than $300 a day to keep them. And once released, at least 80 would reoffend, according to state government average recidivism statistics published by The Age in January.\nEffectiveness of/uni00A0the Drug/uni00A0Court\nThe Drug Court is seen to bene\ufb01t both participants and the community. For participants, it is seen to break the cycle of o\ufb00ending by addressing the underlying causes of o\ufb00ending helping connect the o\ufb00ender to the local community, providing him or her with improved health and wellbeing, self-esteem and employment prospects, and rehabilitating so as to reduce the possibility of reo\ufb00ending.\nIn December 2014, KPMG released a report which evaluated the Drug Court in Victoria. Some of the \nkey \ufb01ndings of the KPMG evaluation found/uni00A0that:\n\u2022 ther e was a signi\ufb01cant reduction in the rate of reo\ufb00ending compared to those who were imprisoned. \nFor example, the rate of reo\ufb00ending in the \ufb01rst 12/uni00A0months for Drug Court participants was 31 per cent \nlower than those who were imprisoned\n\u2022 ther e was a cost saving of approximately $1 212 840 over a two-year period as a result of fewer \nimprisonment/uni00A0days\n\u2022 there were signi\ufb01cant improvements in the participants\u2019 health and wellbeing.\nThere are limits on the number of o\ufb00enders who can be given a DTO. This is largely because of \nthe intensity of the treatment plan and the resources required to ensure participants are given adequate treatment. The new Drug Court which opened in March 2017 in Melbourne will increase the capacity of the court to deal with 240 o\ufb00enders at any one time (as opposed to 70 o\ufb00enders).\nThere have been increasing calls to expand the Drug Court into other regional areas. In particular, \nthere has been a desire for one to be established in Geelong to deal with drug o\ufb00ences. Parts of society are hopeful that the Drug Court will expand to other areas in 2018 and beyond.\nSome have criticised the Drug Court and in particular the rewards program following the launch of the \nMelbourne Drug Court in 2017. Opposition Attorney-General John Pesutto was reported by the Herald Sun as suggesting that the rewards program \u2018bribed\u2019 people to obey the law, saying \u2018people should abide by the law because it\u2019s the right thing to do, not because there\u2019s something in it for them\u2019 .\nSource 4 Sejkan Zekirosvki at the Drug/uni00A0Court\n11_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   364 17/10/2017   3:31 PM",

Since then, it \nhas expanded to become a division of the Children\u2019s Court and County Court. The Koori Court is a sentencing court available to an Aboriginal accused person. Its aim is to provide an informal atmosphere for sentencing, and to allow representation from the Aboriginal community in the sentencing process.  This is achieved by having elders and family members present during sentencing. Koori Courts are particularly important given the over-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the justice system, and the negative experiences that are associated with that over-representation.\nThe Koori Court system has been successful in Victoria, as it aims to explore sentencing alternatives \nto imprisonment and increase Aboriginal ownership and participation in the justice system.\nSource 5 identi\ufb01es where the Koori Court sits in each location as at September 2017.

The magistrate sits opposite the o\ufb00ender, who may have the support of a lawyer, a family member, an Indigenous elder and an Indigenous justice worker. The magistrate can take advice from Aboriginal elders on cultural issues and appropriate sentencing. However, the magistrate is the ultimate decision-maker and uses the same sentencing options that are available in the Magistrates\u2019/uni00A0Court.\nAn Indigenous justice worker, community corrections \no\ufb03cer, special police prosecutor and lawyer for the accused assist the magistrate with the case.

It is an opportunity for an o\ufb00ender to avoid a criminal record, and avoid having being sentenced by a court, on the basis that he or she will comply with certain conditions as part of the/uni00A0plan.\nThe program is intended for \ufb01rst-time o\ufb00enders, and allows those o\ufb00enders to avoid a criminal record. \nIt aims to reduce re-o\ufb00ending, and assist rehabilitation rather than causing the entry of \ufb01rst-time or low risk accused people into the criminal justice system. It aims to save court resources by avoiding the need for a hearing, and aims to enable the accused to avoid a criminal record and access assistance such as rehabilitation and counselling. The program can also involve victims who can participate in the process.\nEligibility\nSection 59 of the Criminal Procedure Act establishes the diversion program in the Magistrates\u2019 Court. For a person to be eligible to partake in the program, the following criteria must be/uni00A0met:\n\u2022 the accused must acknowledge to the Magistrates\u2019 Court responsibility for the o\ufb00ence\u2022 it must appear appropriate to the Magistrates\u2019 Court that the accused should participate in the program\n\u2022 both the prosecution and the accused consent to the matter being diverted\u2022 the o\ufb00ence is not one that is punishable by a minimum or \ufb01xed sentence or penalty (such as a \nsuspension of a licence).\nGenerally, \ufb01rst-time o\ufb00enders are a\ufb00orded the opportunity to undertake \na diversion program if the o\ufb00ence is not too serious.

The  Court may  seek the victim\u2019s views on the \nmatter.\nIf the magistrate agrees that the o\ufb00ender should be diverted away  from sentencing in court, the \no\ufb00ender will be put on a diversion plan, and the proceeding will be adjourned for  up to  12/uni00A0months to  \nenable him or her to  participate in and complete the plan.\nThe diversion plan might involve  the o\ufb00ender having/uni00A0to:\n\u2022 obtain treatment, such as counselling or drug or alcohol treatment\n\u2022 write a letter of apology to  the/uni00A0victim\n\u2022 compens ate the/uni00A0victim\n\u2022 under take an appropriate education/uni00A0course\n\u2022 make a donation or do some other service such as community/uni00A0work.\n11_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   367 17/10/2017   3:31 PM",

(in collaboration with Health Outcomes International Pty Ltd) in 2004 found that between July 2001 and September 2003, over 90 per cent of the diversion program participants were \ufb01rst-time o\ufb00enders, with males representing over double the number of females. It also found that the re-o\ufb00ending rate was very low:/uni00A0of 100 participants, 0 to 7 per cent would be convicted of a subsequent o\ufb00ence in the 12/uni00A0months following commencement of the program. Ninety-four per cent of participants completed the program.\nThe evaluation also suggested that the program was successful in achieving rehabilitation and found \nthat generally the diversion program was successful.\nIt was reported that in January 2015, Chief Magistrate Peter Lauritsen ordered a further review into the \ndiversion program. One of the concerns raised is whether the prosecution should be allowed to prohibit the o\ufb00ender from participating in the diversion program because it did not consent to it.

Matskassy had been living at Domotor\u2019s house in Melton South as a tenant for several months, and Domotor wanted to evict him. The reason for wanting to evict him was unclear, but it seemed to be because Domotor was unhappy with Matskassy\u2019s behaviour.\nDarrington and Domotor eventually found Matskassy at the back of Domotor\u2019s house. Darrington had \na \ufb01ght with Matskassy, during which he punched and kicked Matskassy, causing his head to bleed. After \nthe \ufb01ght, Darrington told Matskassy to go to the bathroom to \u2018clean himself/uni00A0up\u2019 .\nIn his interview with the police some time later, Darrington said that Matskassy \nreturned from the bathroom with a \ufb01rearm, which he used to threaten Darrington. \nIn court, Darrington claimed that there was a struggle over the \ufb01rearm, during which \ntime it discharged. Darrington claimed he had no intention of discharging the \ufb01rearm and that the shot was \ufb01red only due to the struggle for the weapon. \nThe bullet struck Matskassy in the head and he collapsed to the ground. Darrington thought that \nthe bullet had severely injured Matskassy, who was \u2018twitching\u2019 in what Darrington thought was excruciating/uni00A0pain.\nDarrington then reloaded the \ufb01rearm and shot Matskassy a second and third time, because \nhe \u2018didn't know what to do\u2019 and he \u2018didn\u2019t want the bloke su\ufb00ering\u2019 . A medical examination of the body found that Matskassy had in fact died from the \ufb01rst bullet. Therefore, when Darrington discharged the additional two shots into Matskassy, he was already dead.

  "Page 387": "375  CHAPTER  12 RECENT CRIMINAL/uni00A0CASES Courts involved in the case\nBecause Darrington was charged with an indictable o\ufb00ence, to which he pleaded not guilty, a committal \nproceeding would have been held in the Magistrates\u2019 Court. One of the purposes of a committal proceeding is to determine whether there is evidence of a su\ufb03cient weight to support a conviction for the o\ufb00ence. If the magistrate decides that the evidence is of such weight, the accused person will be directed to stand trial in a superior court. \nDarrington\u2019s trial was heard in the Supreme Court of Victoria. Under Section 36A of the County Court \nAct 1958 (Vic), the County Court does not have jurisdiction to hear a case involving a charge of murder, so \nonly the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to hear Darrington\u2019s case. At the opening of the trial, Darrington had pleaded not guilty, so a jury of 12 was chosen, with the role to decide the key facts in the case and reach a verdict.\nThe trial lasted 16/uni00A0days. The jury was not satis\ufb01ed beyond reasonable doubt that the \ufb01rst shot \ufb01red by \nDarrington had not killed Matskassy. The jury was also not satis\ufb01ed that Darrington deliberately \ufb01red this shot. Ultimately, the jury found Darrington guilty of the attempted murder of Rocky Sparticus Matskassy.\nA person can be found guilty of attempting to commit an o\ufb00ence, including murder, even though \nactually carrying out that o\ufb00ence would have been impossible in the circumstances. The person might be unaware that committing the o\ufb00ence is impossible, but they can still be charged and found guilty for attempting it. In this case, Darrington could not have murdered Matskassy when he shot him for the second and third time, because he was already dead. However, Darrington didn\u2019t know that at the/uni00A0time. \nSanctions imposed and their appropriateness\nUnder Section 321P of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic), the penalty for the o\ufb00ence of attempted murder is Level 2 imprisonment. This o\ufb00ence carries a maximum prison sentence of 25/uni00A0years. The court is not compelled to give the maximum sentence in every case. This would only be imposed in the most extreme circumstances.\nJustice Paul Coghlan, who heard the case, noted that the circumstances of the o\ufb00ending were \u2018unusual\u2019 \nand the task of sentencing was di\ufb03cult. He stated that with the exception of one case, there were no similar cases. Other sentences drawn to his attention by the prosecutor involved di\ufb00erent factual situations and were of limited assistance in determining the appropriate sanction.\nHis Honour explained that the jury must have been satis\ufb01ed that Darrington believed that Matskassy \nwas still alive when the second and third shots were \ufb01red. If Darrington did believe it, then according to the law he had an intention to kill, even though Matskassy had died by that stage. Justice Coghlan found that this was \u2018a reasonably serious example of the crime\u2019 .\nJustice Coghlan sentenced Darrington to \na term of imprisonment of eight years with a non-parole period of \ufb01ve years.

  "Page 390": "378  UNIT  2 SANCTIONS, REMEDIES AND/uni00A0RIGHTSThe extent to which the principles of justice were \nachieved\nAn assessment of the extent to which the principles of justice \u2013 fairness, equality and access \u2013 \nwere achieved in R v Darrington is provided below. For each principle, the assessment is made on the \nevidence available.\nFairness\nThe principles of fairness mean people should be treated fairly and impartially. Every person should be aware of the case against them and be able to present their case. The criminal justice system relies on fair legal processes and fair hearings. In this case:\n\u2022 D arrington would have been able to exercise rights prior to and during the trial (e.g. the right to \nsilence when being interviewed by police).\n\u2022 D arrington was legally represented, which the courts have recognised is necessary for a fair trial \nof a serious indictable o\ufb00ence.\n\u2022 At the committal proceeding, Darrington and his defence team knew what the prosecution evidence \nwas, giving them an understanding of the strength of the case the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) would present to the court at the trial. This would have helped the defence prepare for cross-examination of prosecution witnesses.\n\u2022 The prosecution had the burden of establishing that Darrington committed the o\ufb00ence.\n\u2022 The standard of proof in this case is beyond reasonable doubt. Darrington could not be found \nguilty unless the DPP satis\ufb01ed the jury of his guilt according to this high standard. Darrington was \npresumed innocent until proved guilty.\nEquality\nThe principle of equality requires that all people should be equal before the law and have the same opportunity to present their case. Equality in the criminal justice system relies on parties being treated equally. In this case:\n\u2022 Both parties had the right to engage legal representation, which is designed to ensure equality. \nAccording to the rules of procedure, parties can examine the evidence presented by their opponent.\n\u2022 Justice Coghlan acted as an independent and impartial adjudicator at the trial. He ensured that \nthe rules of evidence would have been applied, meaning that only reliable facts were heard by the jury.\n\u2022 D arrington had the bene\ufb01t of trial by a jury of people selected at random from the electoral roll, \nwho reached a verdict based on evidence from both parties (i.e. the prosecution and the defence).\n\u2022 Both parties could call witnesses in the case and have those witnesses examined before the jury.\nAccess\nThe principle of access requires that everyone should have equal access to legal agencies and institutions and be given every opportunity to understand their legal rights and pursue legal claims. For access to be achieved, the criminal justice system relies on accused people having legal advice and representation. Legal representation is essential for parties attempting to navigate through complex legal processes.\nIn a criminal trial, there are strict processes for the sharing of evidence between the parties, especially \nthe key facts that must be revealed by the prosecution to the defence prior to the trial. The burden of proof in a criminal trial rests on the prosecution, and it is their role to lay out all evidence required to establish the case. This helps legal counsel prepare for trial. In this case:fairness \none of the principles of justice; fairness means having fair processes and a fair hearing (e.g. the parties in a legal case should have an opportunity to know the facts of the case and have the opportunity to present their side of events; and the pre-hearing and hearing (or trial) processes should be fair and impartial)\nequality  \none of the principles of justice; equality means people should be equal before the law and have the same opportunity to present their case as anyone else, without advantage or disadvantage \naccess \none of the principles of justice; access means that all people should be able to understand their legal rights and pursue their caseAlthough an accused can appeal against a conviction, the prosecution cannot appeal if the accused is acquitted. This is because, under the rule of \u2018double jeopardy\u2019, a person cannot be tried twice for the same offence. There are now, however, exceptions to the double jeopardy rule following legislative changes in 2011, such as where there is fresh new evidence.\nDid you know?\n12_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   378 17/10/2017   3:52 PM",

In recent years, a range of new \nstrategies and laws have been developed by the Victorian Parliament in an e\ufb00ort to reduce the frequency of road accidents and the impact they have on the community.

In particular, the circumstances surrounding the commission of the o\ufb00ence and the behaviour of the o\ufb00ender on the day of the accident make it an important example of the trauma that can be caused by motor vehicle collisions.\nIn this topic we will explore each of the following aspects of DPP v Singh in detail:\n\u2022 an overview of the charges and central facts of the/uni00A0case\n\u2022 courts involved in the/uni00A0case\u2022 sanctions imposed and their appropriateness\u2022 factors taken into account in sentencing\u2022 possible avenues of/uni00A0appeal\u2022 the extent to which the principles of justice were achieved.\nOverview of/uni00A0the charges and central facts \nof/uni00A0the/uni00A0case\nOn 31 July 2015 at around 3.15 pm, Sukhuinder Singh, age 22, was driving his Holden Commodore west \nalong Bridge Inn Road in Wollert (a suburb in the outer northwest of Melbourne) on his way to \nwork. It was a sunny day and driving conditions were good. The section of Bridge Inn Road \nalong which Singh was travelling was a single lane in each direction and at certain points \nalong the way double lines on the road indicated that overtaking was unsafe.\nAt that time of day, Bridge Inn Road is generally a busy road. There was a \nreasonable amount of tra\ufb03c at the time, and the speed limit on the road was 80 \nkilometres per/uni00A0hour.\nSingh began approaching the rear of a Toyota Kluger that was driving ahead of \nhim and eventually decided to overtake the car. A/uni00A0short distance ahead of the Kluger \nwas a Toyota Corolla. Singh overtook the Kluger, crossing double white lines to do \nso. As he was alongside or almost alongside the Kluger, and while partly on the wrong \nside of the road, he saw a Ford XR8 coming his way. The Ford was driven by John/uni00A0Voss.\nSingh responded by accelerating instead of slowing and pulling safely back onto \nhis side of the road. He reached a speed of 116 kilometres per hour. In his attempt \nto get in front of the Corolla, the rear passenger side of his car clipped the front driver\u2019s side of the Corolla. He lost control of the car and veered into the path of John Voss\u2019s car. John was killed as a result.Source 1 In DDP v Singh Sukhuinder Singh \nwas tried in the County Court of Victoria \nover driving offences that led to the death of another motorist.\n12_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   380 17/10/2017   3:52 PM",

This case serves as a reminder that dangerous behaviour on the roads can lead to signi\ufb01cant/uni00A0harm. \nIn this case, Judge Wilmoth also considered it important that younger and less experienced drivers \nshould be singled out for general deterrence, and that it was important for the community to see that justice has been achieved by dangerous driving o\ufb00ences receiving a custodial sentence. She found speci\ufb01c deterrence to be less important, given recidivism is rare in circumstances such as/uni00A0these.\nJudge Wilmoth also found that rehabilitation was important, particularly for such a youthful o\ufb00ender, \nbut found that general deterrence remained the primary purpose of sentencing.\nIt was reported that John Voss\u2019 father was critical of the sentence, stating that the term of imprisonment \nshould have been much higher so that an example was made of Singh. In particular, Singh\u2019s term of imprisonment, where he may be released in just over two years, was considered to be substantially less than the life that was lost as a result of the incident. general deterrence/uni00A0 \none purpose of a sanction; a process by which the court can discourage the offender and others in the community from committing similar offences\nspeci\ufb01c deterrence  \none purpose of a \nsanction; a process by which the court can discourage the offender from committing similar offences\nrecidivism   \nre-offending; returning \nto crime after already having been convicted and sentenced\u2018What happened from there is he got into strife,\u2019 the lawyer said. \u2018There wasn't enough \nroom for him to pull in.

Judge Wilmoth spoke of the need for general deterrence because of the harm caused by road trauma, such as in this case. In response, defence counsel submitted to the Court that a non-custodial sentence was appropriate due to the low level of moral culpability on the part of Singh. Also, his counsel submitted that he had been learning to drive for four years without breaching any traffic laws, which showed some level of responsibility.\nIn contrast, the prosecution argued that Singh\u2019s culpability was in the medium range because \nhis driving on that day brought an extremely high level of risk. Judge Wilmoth agreed, on the basis that the offender decided to overtake in the process of crossing double lines while driving \nat speed. Judge Wilmoth also noted that an additional aggravating factor was that Singh was a \nlearner driver who was driving without a licensed driver in the/uni00A0car.\nIn noting the need for general deterrence, Judge Wilmoth said that young and less-\nexperienced drivers needed to be the target of any sentence designed to discourage \nsuch behaviour. Justice also needed to be demonstrated for the community that \nin such cases a custodial sentence was necessary. The Judge did note that, on \nthe evidence, Singh was unlikely to offend again in this/uni00A0way.\nIn relation to other mitigating factors, Judge Wilmoth observed that Singh \nhad pleaded guilty at an early stage. This early plea meant that Singh was entitled \nto a discount on his sentence. The early plea also indicated an element of remorse, \nwhich was also shown by a letter that Singh had written to the Court. As a young \noffender with no prior convictions, good prospects and strong family support, Judge \nWilmoth balanced the potential for Singh\u2019s rehabilitation against the need for general deterrence. Her Honour also mentioned that Singh was seriously injured in the collision himself.LEGAL  \nCASE\nSource 4 John Voss was killed \nwhen Singh ploughed into his Ford/uni00A0XR8.\nPossible avenues of/uni00A0appeal\nAny appeals from this decision would need to be made to the Court of Appeal.

For fairness to be achieved, the criminal justice system relies on fair legal processes and fair hearings.\nIn this/uni00A0case:\n\u2022 the law was properly applied. The case makes reference to the nature of the o\ufb00ence and the relevant factors that are required to be taken into account in sentencing.\n\u2022 Singh was able to exercise his rights, including the right to enter a plea to the charges at di\ufb00erent \nstages of the process, and the right to consider the evidence at the committal/uni00A0stage.\n\u2022 Singh was legally represented, which assists in ensuring he receives a fair/uni00A0trial.\n\u2022 Singh and his legal counsel would also have been able to examine the evidence for the prosecution \nduring the committal proceeding.\n\u2022 T he standard of proof in a criminal case is beyond reasonable doubt.

For equality to be achieved, the criminal justice system relies on both parties being treated equally. \nIn this/uni00A0case:\n\u2022 Both parties had the right to engage legal representation.\n\u2022 Equality was ensured at the trial because Judge Wilmoth acted as an independent and impartial \nadjudicator and decided the sanction based on the/uni00A0facts.\n\u2022 Singh had the bene\ufb01t of  trial by a jury of randomly selected people, who listened to the case and \nreached a verdict based on evidence presented from both parties. In this case, Singh was acquitted \non all other charges.\n\u2022 Both parties were entitled to call witnesses in the case and have those witnesses examined before the/uni00A0jury.\nAccess\nThe principle of access suggests that everyone should have equal access to legal agencies and institutions of that system. They should be given every opportunity to understand their legal rights and pursue their legal claims in court. For access to be achieved, the criminal justice system relies on accused people having good advice and legal representation. Those who satisfy the tests for assistance imposed by Victoria Legal Aid may be entitled to legal representation at no charge. Legal representation is essential for parties attempting to navigate through complex legal processes.\nIn a criminal trial, there are strict processes for the sharing of evidence between the parties, \nespecially the key facts that must be revealed by the prosecution to the defence prior to the trial. The burden of proof in a criminal trial rests on the prosecution, and it is their role to lay out all evidence required to establish the case.

Access to this material must be provided to the defence, which helps legal counsel to prepare for/uni00A0trial.\n\u2022 At the end of the trial, both parties had the right of appeal on grounds including the sentence that was imposed by the trial judge and the decisions made during the trial regarding the admissibility of evidence.\n\u2022 Prior to the sentencing of Sukhuinder Singh, members of the Voss family were able to present victim impact statements to the court, which outlined their sense of grief and loss at the death of their loved one. This allows victims to have their response to the o\ufb00ence heard and acted upon by the sentencing/uni00A0judge.Make use of proper \nlegal terminology in your answers to questions.

One offence may have multiple levels of severity, so an offender could appear before either the County Court or Supreme Court, depending on the level of blameworthiness of the offending.

The victim of the crime was covered in petrol and set/uni00A0alight by Kilic, her boyfriend, when she tried to leave him. At the time of the incident, the victim was 12 weeks pregnant with his/uni00A0child.\nThe case brought the issue of sentencing for domestic violence charges into the media spotlight. \nDuring the case, the sentencing judge noted that it was important to impose a sentence that was both appropriate to the crime and to send a message to the community that violence against women will not \nbe tolerated.\nThe case went all the way from the County Court to the High Court. It is a signi\ufb01cant case to study as \nit highlights how the courts can sometimes be in disagreement with each other about the appropriateness \nof the sanction that has been imposed on an o\ufb00ender. It also demonstrates the way in which the High \nCourt is the ultimate court of appeal, and can overrule decisions of lower courts in the same/uni00A0case.\nIn this topic we will explore each of the following aspects of R v Kilic in detail:\n\u2022 an overview of the charges and central facts of the/uni00A0case\n\u2022 courts involved in the/uni00A0case\u2022 sanctions imposed and their appropriateness\u2022 factors taken into account in sentencing\u2022 possible avenues of/uni00A0appeal\u2022 the extent to which the principles of justice were achieved.\nOverview of/uni00A0the charges and central facts \nof/uni00A0the/uni00A0case\nIn July 2014, Yavaz Kilic set his girlfriend on \ufb01re. The victim (who was unnamed in the case) was living \nwith Kilic at his father\u2019s home at the time of the incident. She was 23/uni00A0years old and 12 weeks pregnant with Kilic\u2019s child. People had described the relationship between the pair as \u2018dysfunctional\u2019 and \u2018controlled by drug-use\u2019 . The victim herself described Kilic as controlling and paranoid.\nOn the day of the incident, the victim and a friend, Mr Bond, arrived at Kilic\u2019s house. Mr Bond went to \nopen the door to get out of his car and saw Kilic running across the road in an aggressive manner, holding a samurai sword above his shoulders. He thrust the sword through the car window and walked away, verbally abusing Bond and the victim.\nBond followed Kilic to the house and then inside the house, where he hid the sword in the bathroom \nceiling fan. While Bond was in the bathroom, Kilic went outside and walked up to Bond\u2019s car. The victim was in the backseat and locked the car door in fear when she saw the look on Kilic\u2019s face. Kilic still managed to get in using a door on the other side of the car.

  "Page 401": "389  CHAPTER  12 RECENT CRIMINAL/uni00A0CASES A struggle broke out between Kilic and the victim, who tried to \n\ufb01ght him o\ufb00. Kilic picked up a fuel container from the back seat of \nthe car and poured petrol all over her. He got out of the car and then returned a few minutes later. The victim tried to get out of the car, but Kilic pulled her back in using abusive language. He held a cigarette lighter to her chest and ignited the petrol. Straight away the victim\u2019s clothes, face and hair were in \ufb02ames. She escaped from the \ncar where she attempted to put out the \ufb02ames. Other people at the scene assisted her and called/uni00A0000.\nThe victim was taken to hospital in a critical condition and was \nplaced in an induced coma for \ufb01ve days. She remained in intensive care for nine/uni00A0days.\nThe forensic clinician reported that the victim would have died \nhad she not been treated for her injuries. Only a small section of her skin area was left unhurt. The burn injuries were deep and complex surgery including skin grafting was required. The victim would remain scarred, possibly to large areas of her body, and the future functionality of her hands and limbs would be diminished. Due to the nature and seriousness of her injuries and her long-term prognosis, the victim terminated her pregnancy.\nAt the time of the o\ufb00ence Kilic was on bail and was also serving a community correction order. He \nwas 22/uni00A0years old in 2015 when he was \ufb01rst sentenced in the County Court of Victoria. He pleaded guilty to one charge of causing serious injury intentionally and two summary charges (possessing a prohibited weapon and possessing property suspected of being the proceeds of crime).\nCourts involved in/uni00A0the/uni00A0case\nThe courts involved in this case were the Magistrates\u2019 Court and the County Court. The role of the Magistrates\u2019 Court was to determine, at a committal hearing, whether there was evidence of su\ufb03cient weight to support a conviction of Kilic at his trial in a higher court. Kilic pleaded guilty at the committal stage, which saved the legal system and the witnesses in this case the burden of a trial in a superior court. \nThe o\ufb00ence of causing serious injury intentionally is an indictable o\ufb00ence, which can be heard in the \nCounty Court or the Supreme Court of Victoria. Cases involving intentionally causing serious injury are \nmost often heard in the County Court. Where summary o\ufb00ence charges have also been laid, these are heard and determined at the same time as the indictable o\ufb00ence.\nIn this case, his Honour Judge Montgomery of the County Court sentenced Kilic. There was no jury \ntrial, as Kilic pleaded guilty.\nSanctions imposed and their appropriateness\nIn Victoria, a person who, without lawful excuse, intentionally causes serious injury to another person is guilty of a crime. This crime is an indictable o\ufb00ence under the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic), and the potential \npenalty is severe:/uni00A0judges are able to impose a term of imprisonment of up to 20/uni00A0years. This indicates how seriously the Victorian Parliament views any behaviour that causes serious harm to another person and is intentional (that is, the person deliberately set out to seriously injure another person). The law also serves to provide an element of general deterrence for the community, so that people are discouraged from \ncausing harm in this/uni00A0way.bail  \nthe release of an \naccused person from custody on condition that they will attend a court hearing to answer the charges \njury \nan independent group of people chosen at random to decide on the evidence in a legal case and reach a decision (i.e. verdict)\ngeneral deterrence/uni00A0 \none purpose of a sanction; a process by which the court can discourage the offender and others in the community from committing similar offencesSource 2 In R v Kilic, the accused Yavaz Kilic poured petrol over the victim and ignited her with a cigarette lighter. \n12_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   389 17/10/2017   3:52 PM",
  "Page 402": "390  UNIT  2 SANCTIONS, REMEDIES AND/uni00A0RIGHTSAt the sentencing hearing on 30 March 2015, the judge took the view \nthat imprisonment was the only sentencing option that was available \nin this case, because of the seriousness of the crime. The sentencing remarks are contained in DPP v Kilic [2015] VCC 392 (30 March/uni00A02015).\nOn the charge of causing serious injury intentionally, Judge \nMontgomery sentenced Kilic to a period of imprisonment of 14/uni00A0 years. On the \ufb01rst summary o\ufb00ence, Kilic was sentenced to 12/uni00A0 months imprisonment, six months of it to be served cumulatively with the indictable o\ufb00ence charge. On the second summary o\ufb00ence, Kilic was sentenced to a further 12/uni00A0months imprisonment, six months of that to be served as a cumulative sentence. The total period of imprisonment was 15/uni00A0years. Judge Montgomery set a non-parole period of 11/uni00A0years. The time that Kilic had already served in prison (242/uni00A0days) was declared as part of the term of imprisonment.\nThe Judge stated that if Kilic pleaded not guilty, he would have been \nsentenced to 18/uni00A0years in prison, with a non-parole period of 15/uni00A0years.\nIn sentencing Kilic, Judge Montgomery took into account general \ndeterrence. He stated that \u2018I \ufb01nd it hard to recall a more serious example of this type of o\ufb00ending in my 38/uni00A0years in the criminal law\u2019 , and indicated that it was important that people were deterred from committing similar type o\ufb00ences. Judge Montgomery also noted that the Court had to send a message to the community about violence against women (see extract below).\ncumulative sentence  \nwhen a defendant is \nfound guilty of more than one offence, the judge may sentence them to consecutive (i.e. cumulative) terms for each crime. This means each sentence must be served one after the other rather than at the same time Source 3  Kilic\u2019s case began in the Magistrates\u2019 Court (top) and continued in the County Court (bottom).\nDPP v Kilic [2015] VCC 392 (30 March/uni00A02015)\nThe courts have to send a message to the community that violence against women will not \nbe tolerated under any circumstances. The problems of differences in a relationship and the use of drugs such as ice in no way excuse the horrific violence that you inflicted on someone you supposedly cared for. Can we open the newspapers on any day without an account of some man inflicting violence on a woman in a minor or major/uni00A0way?EXTRACT\nJudge Montgomery also took into account speci\ufb01c deterrence, noting that Kilic has had numerous \nconvictions, and at the time of o\ufb00ending was on bail and on a community correction order. The aim of speci\ufb01c deterrence is designed to discourage the o\ufb00ender from committing more o\ufb00ences in the future. He also expressed his denunciation, and stated that he had to consider protection of the community, as the way that Kilic acted posed a risk to the community (and there were no psychiatric or psychological reports to explain his o\ufb00ending).

  "Page 405": "393  CHAPTER  12 RECENT CRIMINAL/uni00A0CASES The second ground of appeal was refused. Kilic sought to produce evidence to suggest that the true \nsigni\ufb01c ance of the victim\u2019s injuries were not fully comprehended at the time of sentence. He tried to rely \non Facebook photos which showed the victim \u2018out and about\u2019 and with minimal scarring. Kilic\u2019s father and \nsister also gave evidence which suggested that the victim could move with little di\ufb03culty.\nThe Court of Appeal rejected that this was fresh evidence, and found that it did not contradict the \n\ufb01ndings made by the trial judge about the use of the victim\u2019s hands or the functionality of her limbs. It refused leave to appeal on this ground.\nHowever, the Court of Appeal upheld the appeal on the \ufb01rst ground, and found that the sentence that \nhad been given at the trial by Judge Montgomery had signi\ufb01cantly exceeded those that had previously been given for convictions involving more horri\ufb01c assaults.\nThe Court of Appeal also mentioned:\n\u2022 Kilic\u2019 s youth was a relevant consideration, and held that Judge Montgomery did not completely take \nthis into account\n\u2022 the fact that Kilic had also su\ufb00ered extensive burns in the incident when he attempted to extinguish the \n\ufb02ames after setting the victim/uni00A0alight\n\u2022 the fact that the sentence was handed down immediately after the plea hearing.

The High Court had to consider whether the Court of Appeal made \nan error in its consideration of current sentencing practices.\nThe High Court handed down its decision on 7 December 2016, and allowed the appeal, agreeing \nwith the DPP. The citation for that case is R v Kilic (2016) 339 ALR 229. The High Court stated that it was correct to consider \u2018current sentencing practices\u2019 to promote consistency of approach in sentencing and to ensure that current sentencing re\ufb02ects current community attitudes (such as attitudes towards crimes involving domestic violence). However, past sentences do not impose \u2018boundaries\u2019 for future sentences. The High Court found that the Court of Appeal used past sentences in the few cases mentioned as \u2018de\ufb01ning\u2019 the sentencing range. The Court then made an error in \ufb01nding that because Kilic\u2019s sentence exceeded those sentences, it was excessive.\nThe High Court found that cases involving the o\ufb00ence of intentionally causing serious injury by \ufb01re are \nuncommon, and the few cases that had been examined by the Court of Appeal could not be considered as a sentencing pattern that could be used as a guide in the Kilic case. It also held that given the o\ufb00ending in this case was at the upper end of the range of seriousness, and a sentence of 20/uni00A0years imprisonment was the maximum, 14/uni00A0years imprisonment should not be regarded as manifestly excessive.\nThe High Court upheld the appeal by the DPP and reinstated the original sentence that had been \nimposed in the County/uni00A0Court.\nThe extent to/uni00A0which the/uni00A0principles of/uni00A0justice were \nachieved\nAn assessment of the extent to which the principles of justice \u2013 fairness, equality and access \u2013 \nwere achieved in DPP v Kilic is provided below.

Every person should be \naware of the case against them and be able to present their case. The criminal justice system relies on fair legal processes and fair hearings. In this case:\n\u2022 T here were two appeals, and the matter was ultimately heard in the High Court. Both parties had the \nopportunity to appeal to ensure the law was properly applied and su\ufb03cient weight was given to \nsentencing factors.\n\u2022 Kilic and his legal counsel were able to examine the evidence presented at the committal stage \nbefore Kilic pleaded guilty. This would have given the defence a good understanding of the weight of evidence against Kilic, which is appropriate, given that Kilic was presumed to be innocent until such time that he pleaded guilty.\n\u2022 Kilic was able to exercise his rights, including the right to enter a plea to the charges at di\ufb00erent stages of the process, the right to make submissions during sentencing, and the right to appeal.\n\u2022 T he Court of Appeal and the High Court both considered relevant sentencing practices and \nprevious cases to determine the sentence. Both parties had an opportunity to present submissions at these hearings.\nEquality\nThe principle of equality requires that all people should be equal before the law and have the same opportunity to present their case. Equality in the criminal justice system relies on parties being treated in equally. In this case:\n\u2022 Both parties had the right to engage legal representation, which is designed to ensure equality \nbetween the parties, who examine evidence presented by their opponent. Both parties were represented, which ensured they were on equal footing.\n\u2022 The judges were independent and impartial adjudicators, with no connection to the parties.\n\u2022 Both parties had equal opportunity to make submissions at the sentencing hearing and during the \nappeal process.\nAccess\nThe principle of access requires that everyone should have equal access to legal agencies and institutions. They should be given every opportunity to understand their legal rights and pursue legal claims. For access to be achieved, the criminal justice system relies on accused people having legal advice and representation. Those who satisfy the tests for assistance imposed by Victoria Legal Aid may be entitled to legal representation at no charge. Legal representation is essential for parties attempting to navigate through complex legal processes.\nIn a criminal trial, there are strict processes for the sharing \nof evidence between the parties, especially the key facts that must be revealed by the prosecution to the defence prior to the trial. The burden of proof in a criminal trial rests on the prosecution, and it is their role to lay out all evidence required to establish the case. This helps legal counsel prepare for trial.

It is a crime under Section 75A \nof the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) and involves the committing of a robbery with the use of a \ufb01rearm, imitation \ufb01rearm, o\ufb00ensive weapon, explosive or imitation weapon. Armed robbery is an indictable o\ufb00ence which can lead to imprisonment of up to 25 years. In 2016, the Victorian Parliament passed legislation which amended the Crimes Act, creating the new o\ufb00ences of carjacking and aggravated carjacking.\nThe case of DDP v Gatkuoth [2016] VCC 634 (17 May 2016) is a recent criminal case involving a \ncarjacking, but the accused was charged with armed robbery (as the carjacking crime was not created at this time).

  "Page 409": "397  CHAPTER  12 RECENT CRIMINAL/uni00A0CASES Overview of/uni00A0the charges and central facts of the case\nOn 5 November 2015, Sam Newman and Daniel Sibberas were returning home from a club in the early hours \nof the morning. Isaac Gatkuoth (then 18 years old) and others were in a stolen white BMW. They stalked Newman\u2019s car and rammed it from behind. Newman and Sibberas walked towards the BMW and asked them what they were doing. Gatkuoth and two others got out of the BMW, walked up to Newman, and pointed a sawn-o\ufb00 shotgun at his head. Newman was scared and handed over his keys when told to. He begged Gatkuoth not to shoot him, and ran for safety with Sibberas when their car was driven away.\nThe police observed the stolen car travelling at great speed, followed by the BMW. Gatkuoth was arrested \ntwo weeks later. During the interview, Gatkuoth admitted that he was armed with a single barrel shotgun, and had purchased it two days earlier along with ice, which he had been using at the time of the o\ufb00ence. He admitted to wearing a mask with a smiley face when the o\ufb00ending occurred and said he\u2019d been drinking. He said the gun was not loaded. Gatkuoth was charged with, and pleaded guilty to, armed robbery.\nA number of facts about Gatkuoth\u2019s upbringing have come to light since the crime. He was born in Sudan, \nAfrica, where he lived with his extended family. He came to Australia shortly before turning 10. His memories of Sudan are of gangs, violence and weapons. Two of Gatkuoth\u2019s brothers died in Sudan and when he was 16 he became aware that his father had been killed by a rival group in Sudan. \nIn February 2017, it was reported that Sam Newman, one of the victims of Gatkuoth\u2019s crime, took \nhis own life in January that year. His mother said that while she appreciated that Gatkuoth had a terrible upbringing, he had damaged the very community that had reached out to help him, and that he and other teens involved in carjackings and home invasions were not being punished severely enough.\nIt was also reported that a number of o\ufb00enders, including Gatkuoth, would face deportation as they were \nconsidered to be associated with the \u2018Apex gang\u2019 . Federal Immigration Minister Peter Dutton also said that the Victorian Government needed to \u2018do more\u2019 to address gang violence.\nA petition was created online to stop the Australian Government from deporting Gatkuoth. Online blogs \nand commentary discussed Gatkuoth\u2019s case, as well as questioned whether an \u2018Apex gang\u2019 exists or whether it is even a gang. Gatkuoth has consistently denied he is part of any gang.\nCourts involved in/uni00A0the/uni00A0case\nThe o\ufb00ence of armed robbery is an indictable o\ufb00ence. Both the County Court and the Supreme Court have jurisdiction to hear this o\ufb00ence. In almost all instances, it is heard by the County/uni00A0Court. This case was heard in the County Court.\nGatkuoth was 18 at the time of o\ufb00ending. Had he been 17/uni00A0years or younger, then the case would have \nbeen heard in the Children\u2019s/uni00A0Court.\nBecause Gatkuoth pleaded guilty early, there was no need for the Magistrates\u2019 Court to be involved by \nway of a committal hearing. There was also no jury/uni00A0trial.\nSanctions imposed and their appropriateness\nGatkuoth\u2019s counsel submitted that he should be sentenced to a period of detention in a Y outh Justice Centre. There were a number of factors to support this including his youth, admissions, early guilty plea, fragile mental health, commitment to self-improvement and rehabilitation, and the support he enjoyed from his older sister.\nJudge Taft agreed. On the charge of armed robbery, Gatkuoth was ordered to be detained in a Y outh \nJustice Centre for 16/uni00A0months. On the charge of being a prohibited person carrying a \ufb01rearm, he was ordered to be detained in a Y outh Justice Centre for four months. The sentences were ordered to be served concurrently and with the sentence that he was currently undertaking.\nJudge Taft noted that if Gatkuoth had pleaded not guilty, he would have been sentenced to a period of \ndetention in a Y outh Justice Centre for 24/uni00A0months.committal hearing \na hearing that is held as part of the committal proceeding.

Judge Taft stated that after Gatkuoth arrived in Australia, he attended \nlanguage school in Springvale and \ufb01nished primary school in Endeavour Hills. The judge said \nGatkuoth was involved in \ufb01ghts on a daily basis, and was bullied because people did not like him. His life improved from Y ears 7 to 9, when he was Y ear 7 sports captain, and then transferred to Hallam Secondary School for Y ear 10, hoping to join the sports academy. However, he was not successful. He lost hope and began skipping school and using drugs. He was expelled in Y ear 10 for using cannabis. \n\u2022 Gatkuoth\u2019s drug use. Gatkuoth started using anti-depressants once he started serving time in \ndetention, and admitted to smoking ice. He recognised he was a \u2018mess\u2019 , and would often stay awake for several weeks at a time, hallucinating and hearing voices.\n\u2022 Gatkuoth\u2019s signi\ufb01cant criminal history. This included multiple thefts and aggravated burglary.

  "Page 412": "400  UNIT  2 SANCTIONS, REMEDIES AND/uni00A0RIGHTSEquality\nThe principle of equality suggests that all people should be equal before the law, regardless of who \nthey are. Every person in society should also have the same opportunity to present their case without advantage or disadvantage. For equality to be achieved, the criminal justice system relies on both parties being treated equally. \nIn this/uni00A0case:\n\u2022 Both parties had the right to engage legal representation. The availability of legal representation aims to achieve equality between the parties, who are able to examine the evidence being presented by their opponent.\n\u2022 Equality was ensured at the sentencing hearing because Judge Taft played the role of an independent and impartial adjudicator, who enforces rules of evidence and procedure to ensure that both parties had the opportunity to make submissions about sentencing\n\u2022 Both parties were represented at the plea hearing and sentencing hearing.\nAccess\nThe principle of access suggests that everyone should have equal access to the agencies and institutions of that system. They should be given every opportunity to understand their legal rights and pursue their legal claims in court. For access to be achieved, the criminal justice system relies on accused people having good advice and legal representation. Those who satisfy the tests for assistance imposed by Victoria Legal Aid may be entitled to legal representation at no charge. Legal representation is essential for parties attempting to navigate through complex legal processes.\nIn a criminal trial, there are strict processes for the sharing of evidence between the parties, especially \nthe key facts that must be revealed by the prosecution to the defence prior to the trial.

  "Page 420": "408  UNIT  2 SANCTIONS, REMEDIES AND RIGHTSTHE PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE IN \nCIVIL/uni00A0LAW13.2 \nMake a note when you \ncome across something in this chapter that relates to one of these principles. For example, when you look at the role of the courts in resolving civil disputes, identify how the courts can achieve fairness, equality and access. Study/uni00A0tipThroughout this chapter, you will look at the way in which civil disputes are resolved and how outcomes \nare achieved. In order to assess whether outcomes are just, it is helpful to apply the principles of justice. The three principles of justice include: fairness, equality and access.\n A brief summary of the principles, and how they apply to civil disputes, is provided/uni00A0in this topic.\nFairness\nParties to a civil dispute must be dealt with fairly, and any outcome reached must be fair. What does this mean? In civil disputes, it means that there should be fair processes and a fair hearing or trial. This means that laws should be properly applied, the parties to a civil dispute should know what the claims and defences are and what evidence will be used to support the other side\u2019s case, and should have the opportunity to present their case and rebut the other person\u2019s/uni00A0case. The people who are deciding the dispute should be impartial and unbiased. \nFor example, by the time the matter gets to trial or hearing, the plainti\ufb00 (the party suing another), \nshould know why the defendant says that he, she or it was not in the wrong. \nFairness means there should be a fair hearing or trial, but the processes involved in resolving a civil \ndispute should also be fair, including any processes used to resolve the dispute before hearing or trial. For example, one of the procedures in a civil dispute is that each party discover relevant documents, which requires the party to list the documents that are relevant to the dispute and provide copies to the other side. This enables a fair playing \ufb01eld by ensuring the parties have knowledge of the documents that the other party has well before trial (or hearing as it is called in the Magistrates\u2019 Court).\nEquality \nEquality means that all people should be treated equally before the law, with an equal opportunity to present their case. In the civil justice system, this means that no person or group should be treated better or worse because of a personal attribute or characteristic. That is, the processes should be free from bias or prejudice, and the persons who help to resolve a civil dispute should be impartial. In the civil justice system, equality is often upheld through the use of an impartial and unbiased judge or magistrate, who has no connection with either party when hearing the case and making a determination. It is also upheld through the use of a civil jury (as required), whose members must also have no connection with either party. Responsibilities are also imposed on a civil jury to ensure that they do not conduct their own research or investigation into the/uni00A0case.\nProcesses in the civil justice system should also ensure that certain groups in society, particularly \nvulnerable groups such as people with disabilities or mental health issues, or those who do not have signi\ufb01cant \ufb01nancial resources, are not disadvantaged. Because of the way that our civil justice system operates, particularly the processes and high costs involved, many people are not equal before the law, even without deliberate discrimination.fairness \none of the principles of justice; fairness means having fair processes and a fair hearing (e.g. the parties in a legal case should have an opportunity to know the facts of the case and have the opportunity to present their side of events; and the pre-hearing and hearing (or trial) processes should be fair and impartial)\nequality \none of the principles of justice; equality means people should be equal before the law and have the same opportunity to present their case as anyone else, without advantage or disadvantage\naccess \none of the principles of justice; access means that all people should be able to understand their legal rights and pursue their case\nSource 1  Are the principles of equality and fairness being \nachieved here?\ntribunal a dispute resolution body that resolves civil disputes and is intended to be a less costly, more informal and faster way to resolve disputes than courts\n13_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   408 17/10/2017   4:03 PM",

People  should  be able  \nto use the procedures,  methods  and institutions  that  resolve  a civil dispute .

  "Page 422": "410  UNIT  2 SANCTIONS, REMEDIES AND RIGHTSMETHODS USED TO  RESOLVE A/uni00A0CIVIL \nDISPUTE13.3 \nA party to  a civil dispute can use various methods to  reach an agreement and settle the dispute. These \nmethods are  called dispute resolution methods. They  are a way  to obtain an outcome in a civil dispute \nthat does not involve  a court or tribunal making a binding decision on the parties. Dispute resolution \nmethods are  sometimes known as alternative dispute resolution methods, but these methods are  now  \nso often used to  resolve disputes that the word  \u2018alternative\u2019 is becoming less appropriate to  describe/uni00A0them.\nThese methods include:\n\u2022 mediation\n\u2022 conciliation \n\u2022 arbitration.\nThe legal system encourages the use \nof mediation, conciliation and arbitration \nto resolve disputes because they are  often \nless stressful and less expensive than court \naction, and in some situations even  less \nstressful and less expensive than issuing a claim through a tribunal.\nMediation\nMediation is a cooperative method of resolving disputes. It is widely used by  courts, tribunals and \nother dispute resolution bodies. It is a joint problem-solving process in which the parties in dispute sit down and discuss the issues they disagree on, put their side of the case and try to  reach an agreement through \nnegotiation. They  do this with the help of  a mediator, \nwho is neutral and impartial.\nMediators are  trained to  assist the parties to  reach \na decision. The mediator tries to \u2018empower\u2019 both \nparties. That  is, the mediator helps the parties feel \nmore in control of the situation and more con\ufb01dent during negotiations. The  mediator discusses the issues \nwith the parties and tries to  even  out any  imbalance \nbetween the parties while providing them with support. The  mediators do not necessarily need to  be \nexperts in the area of  law that is the subject of the \ndispute, but they do need to  have  good people skills \nand a high level of con\ufb02ict resolution skills. Their job is to help people come to  a decision,  not make the \ndecision for  them. A/uni00A0mediator will not make decisions \nabout whether there has been a breach of the law,  or \no\ufb00er leg\nal advice.alternative dispute \nresolution methods ways  of resolving or \nsettling civil disputes that do not involve a court or tribunal hearing (e.g. mediation, conciliation and arbitration); also known as appropriate dispute resolution\nmediation  \na method of dispute resolution, using an independent third party (the mediator) to  help \nthe disputing parties reach a resolution\nconciliation \na method of dispute resolution which uses an independent third party (i.e. the conciliator) to  help the \ndisputing parties reach a resolution\narbitration  \na method of dispute resolution in which an independent person (known as an arbitrator) is appointed to  listen to  \nboth sides of a dispute and make a decision that is legally binding on the parties.

  "Page 423": "411  CHAPTER  13 REMEDIESAny discussions during mediation will be \u2018without \nprejudice\u2019 , meaning that the parties are free to discuss the case, \nand the strengths and weaknesses of each case, without those \ndiscussions later being used against them. This can allow the parties to speak freely and without fear of it being detrimental to their case if the matter does not settle at mediation.\nIf the parties resolve the case through mediation, they will \nnormally enter into a legally binding contract known as terms of settlement, or a deed of settlement. This means that the parties will be bound by the promises they make at mediation. This deed of settlement or agreement may be enforceable through the courts.\nMediation is available to parties in a civil dispute in the \nfollowing/uni00A0ways:\n\u2022 par ties can organise a private mediation between them. \nMediators can be accessed through the Victorian Bar website, and through organisations such as the \nDispute Settlement Centre of Victoria and a Family Relationship Centre that o\ufb00er free or low-cost mediation services\n\u2022 par ties in a court case are often referred to mediation by a court before the \ufb01nal trial or hearing to \nsee if a resolution can be reached. Each of the Magistrates\u2019 Court, County Court and Supreme Court actively orders parties to attend mediation before the matter is set down for hearing or/uni00A0trial\n\u2022 par ties in a tribunal case are also often referred to mediation to try and resolve the dispute before the \nhearing.\nConciliation\nConciliation is also a process of dispute resolution involving the assistance of an independent third party, \nwith the aim of enabling the parties to reach a decision. In many ways it operates the same way as mediation, but the role of the third party is di\ufb00erent.\nThe third party, known as the conciliator, listens to both sides of the dispute and makes suggestions \nabout appropriate ways of resolving the matter. The conciliator assists the parties by exploring solutions to the dispute, and is usually someone with specialist knowledge about the subject matter of the dispute (for example, is skilled in employee/employer relations if it is an issue about worker\u2019s/uni00A0pay).\nThe \ufb01nal decision is made by the parties and is not binding. However, like mediation, it is often the case \nthat the parties will enter into terms of settlement, which can be legally enforceable. Like mediation, any discussions during conciliation are on a \u2018without prejudice\u2019 basis, meaning that those discussions cannot be used against either party if the matter does not settle at conciliation.\nConciliation is available to parties in a civil dispute in the following/uni00A0ways:\n\u2022 man y dispute resolution bodies (some of which you will explore in the next topic) use a form of \nconciliation to resolve disputes. These include the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission and Consumer A\ufb00airs Victoria\n\u2022 par ties in a dispute at the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) are also often sent to \nwhat is called a compulsory conference. The compulsory conference uses conciliation as a way to help the parties come to a resolution\n\u2022 some of the more specialised courts use a form of conciliation. For example, in the Family Court of \nAustralia, which has power to hear family disputes, a conciliation conference is organised between the parties to try and reach an agreement about \ufb01nancial or parenting issues.terms of settlement /uni00A0 \na document that sets out the terms on which the parties agree to resolve their dispute\nconciliator  \nthe independent third party in a conciliation who helps the parties reach an agreement that will end the dispute between them.

If this is not possible, the third party makes a binding decision on the parties. The arbitration decision is known as an arbitral award, and is fully enforceable if the party does not comply with/uni00A0it.\nIn taking their case to arbitration, the parties agree to abide by the arbitrator\u2019s decision. For example, in \na commercial contract a clause may be included stating that the parties agree to take any dispute between the parties to an arbitrator, and agree to be bound by the decision of the arbitrator.\nProfessional arbitrators charge the parties a fee for acting as an arbitrator in a dispute. The arbitrator \nwill generally have knowledge of the subject matter, and will also have an understanding of the applicable law. Arbitration is often used in commercial situations and in international disputes. Legal representation is usually allowed during the arbitration process. It can therefore be an expensive process. The way the arbitration is conducted often depends on what has been agreed. That is, the parties can choose how evidence is presented, how formal the arbitration is, and what procedural rules will/uni00A0apply.\n13_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   412 17/10/2017   4:03 PM",

  "Page 428": "416  UNIT  2 SANCTIONS, REMEDIES AND RIGHTSRole of/uni00A0tribunals\nTribunals are dispute resolution bodies which obtain their power \nfrom parliament to resolve certain types of disputes. That is, parliament will pass a statute giving a particular tribunal the authority to hear and determine certain types of matters and applications. For example, the Mental Health Act 2014 (Vic),  a statute passed by the Victorian Parliament, establishes the Mental Health Tribunal and gives it powers, including the power to hear an application to determine whether neurosurgery for mental illness should be performed on a person. Tribunals develop expertise in particular types of disputes and are able to make binding decisions on the parties.\nThe purpose of tribunals is to provide individuals with a low-\ncost, e\ufb03cient and speedy method of dispute resolution \nprocess. Tribunals therefore increase the community\u2019s access to justice. It provides Australians with an alternative option to resolving disputes to that of courts, which can often be seen as a more formal, costly, stressful and lengthy way of resolving disputes, particularly small disputes that can be readily dealt with without having to deal with courts.\nTribunals are not able to hear every type of dispute. For example, tribunals have no power to hear \nrepresentative proceedings (also known as class actions).\nSome tribunals have similar characteristics to courts. For example, similar to courts, an independent \nthird party will hear the dispute and make a binding decision on the parties, and the parties are often referred to a form of dispute resolution method such as mediation to resolve the dispute before the \ufb01nal hearing. However, there are signi\ufb01cant di\ufb00erences between the two \u2013 the costs involved in having a dispute resolved at a tribunal, in particular, can often be much/uni00A0less.\nTribunals in/uni00A0Australia\nIn Australia, there are both Commonwealth and state tribunals.

  "Page 432": "420  UNIT  2 SANCTIONS, REMEDIES AND RIGHTSTHE OMBUDSMAN 13.5 \nAn ombudsman is an o\ufb03cial appointed by the government to investigate complaints made by individuals \nagainst certain bodies or institutions. Like tribunals, an ombudsman obtains power to hear and determine complaints through parliament. The parliament grants the ombudsman powers by passing a statute. For example, the Victorian Ombudsman was established by the Ombudsman Act 1973/uni00A0(Vic).\nRole of/uni00A0an ombudsman\nThe role of an ombudsman is to provide individuals with independent, timely and accessible dispute \nresolution services in particular industries. They are intended to provide a fair, free and independent \nway of handling complaints and resolving disputes. There are two types of ombudsman:\n\u2022 a government ombudsman, who deals with disputes or complaints about government agencies\n\u2022 an industry ombudsman, who deals with disputes between consumers and businesses in particular \nindustries such as telecommunications, \ufb01nancial services, public transport, and energy and/uni00A0water.\nAn ombudsman is not a court or a tribunal. Therefore, power of the o\ufb03ce is often limited to certain \nindustries and businesses over which the ombudsman has power to hear complaints. In many instances, \nthe ombudsman will not hear a complaint unless the individual has \ufb01rst tried to resolve the complaint with the business.\nUnlike courts and tribunals, an ombudsman is free. Further, unlike courts and tribunals, most \nombudsman services hear complaints from individuals against industry providers, agencies and businesses (and not vice versa). That is, they are generally designed to o\ufb00er individuals and small businesses with a service to hear and determine complaints about services that have been provided to them. This helps to overcome some power imbalances that people may feel when dealing with large service providers or government agencies.\nAn ombudsman will \ufb01rst try and resolve the complaint by working with the two parties. Where an \nagreement cannot be reached, the ombudsman may  have the power to make a binding decision on the \nparties, though whether that decision has to be followed depends on the ombudsman.\nAlthough every ombudsman is appointed by government, they act impartially and independently \nof government when handling claims. One of the key features of an ombudsman is that they ensure procedural fairness by giving parties an opportunity to respond to a complaint, and by giving reasons for any decision that is/uni00A0made.\nOmbudsmen\u2019s offices in/uni00A0Australia\nIn Australia, there are both Commonwealth and state o\ufb03ces of the ombudsman. Some of the areas which have a Commonwealth ombudsman are set out in Source 2/uni00A0below.The word \u2018ombudsman\u2019 \nwas borrowed from the Swedish language, and has been used in English since 1959. The word in Swedish literally means \u2018commission man\u2019, referring to a complaints office called the justitieombudsmannen, which hears and investigates complaints by individuals against abuses of the state. The office of ombudsman is always held by a single person. Because the word is a direct borrowing, it is never turned into \u2018ombudsperson\u2019 in English./uni00A0 Did you/uni00A0know?Source 1  Judi Jones \nis currently the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman.\nCOMMONWEALTH \nOMBUDSMANDESCRIPTION\nCommonwealth \nOmbudsmanThe Commonwealth Ombudsman investigates complaints made about the actions of a government department.

Similar to a tribunal or an ombudsman, complaints bodies obtain their power through parliament.\nThe role of/uni00A0a complaints/uni00A0body\nComplaints bodies deal with complaints about the provision of goods and services, or decisions made by certain bodies or authorities. They are intended to provide a free complaints and dispute resolution service so that ordinary Australians have access to dispute resolution services without any cost to/uni00A0them.\nMost dispute resolution services focus on a particular industry or service. For example, the Disability \nServices Commissioner can hear complaints by people who receive disability services about their providers, but will not be able to hear and determine disputes about lawyers (this type of service is o\ufb00ered by the Legal Services Commissioner).\nLike an ombudsman, complaints bodies are designed to hear complaints from individuals and small \nbusinesses about services or goods provided to them, and generally do not hear disputes about individuals. However, unlike an ombudsman, complaints bodies generally do not have the power to conduct a hearing or make binding decisions on the parties. That is, their services are limited to o\ufb00ering free or low cost dispute resolution services where the parties agree to settle the dispute between/uni00A0them.\nComplaints bodies do not use formal procedures to resolve disputes, and most o\ufb00er \ufb02exible services \nso that they are accessible to everyone. For example, many will o\ufb00er the ability for people to make complaints online or over the/uni00A0phone.\nIn addition to providing dispute resolution services, many complaints bodies are able to take \nenforcement action against persons or companies that do not comply with certain laws. For example, in 2016 and 2017, Consumer A\ufb00airs Victoria, a Victorian complaints body, took action against Belle Gibson in the Federal/uni00A0Court. This legal case is further explored below.\nBlogger lies to cancer sufferers\nDirector of Consumer Affairs \nVictoria v Gibson [2017] FCA 240 (15 March/uni00A02017)\nBelle Gibson was a blogger, app publisher \nand alternative health treatment promoter. Her company developed, promoted and sold a successful app called \u2018The Whole Pantry\u2019 and a book with the same name. While developing and promoting these products, Gibson made a number of statements claiming she had been diagnosed with brain cancer in 2009, and that she had pursued natural remedies to treat the cancer. Various social media LEGAL \nCASE\nSource 1 Belle Gibson was found to have \ncontravened consumer legislation by misleading and deceiving consumers, and making misrepresentations.\nIn 2015 the Australian Government established the Office of the eSafety Commissioner, a complaints body whichprovides complaints services for young Australians who experience serious cyberbullying. The Office was establishedto help address the negative and harmful experiences that young people often suffer online.Did you/uni00A0know?\n13_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   424 17/10/2017   4:03 PM",

The VEOHRC intervened in the family\u2019s case to VCAT. The case is seen as a win for the VEOHRC and the position it took on the case. Focus on the/uni00A0Victorian Equal Opportunity and \nHuman Rights Commission\nThe Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission (VEOHRC) is an independent body. It \no\ufb00ers a free, fair and timely dispute resolution service.\nThe VEOHRC receives its powers from various Victorian statutes to help people resolve complaints \nabout discrimination, sexual harassment, victimisation and vili\ufb01cation. The two main statutes that confer power on the VEOHRC are the Equal Opportunity Act 2010 (Vic) and the Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001 (Vic). Each of these statutes, in various ways, seeks to protect human rights and prevent people from \nbeing discriminated against, harassed or vili\ufb01ed.\nThe Equal Opportunity Act is the main statute in Victoria which makes it unlawful for a person to be \ndiscriminated against. The Act sets out the attributes that a person can be discriminated against (such as age, breastfeeding, gender identity, parental status, physical features and disability), and the areas or activities in which a person may be discriminated against (such as in employment, education, sport or the provision of goods or services). \nThe Racial and Religious Tolerance Act makes \nit unlawful for a person to incite hatred or ridicule against a person or a group of people based on race or religion. It also makes it unlawful for one person to victimise another person.\nThe services provided by the VEOHRC include \na free, fair and timely dispute resolution service for people who believe that they have been harassed, vili\ufb01ed, victimised or discriminated against.\nThe complaint process that is used by the VEOHRC \nis conciliation. A/uni00A0person will assist the parties to talk through the issues with the aim of reaching agreement on how the dispute will be resolved. This can involve \ufb01nancial compensation, an apology, job reinstatement (where a person has lost their job on the basis of discrimination) or an agreement that the behaviour will/uni00A0stop.VICTORIAN \nCOMPLAINTS BODYDESCRIPTION\nDisability Services \nCommissioner (DSC)The DSC helps people with a disability resolve their complaints about disability service providers. It offers conciliation services to parties, and also has the power to investigate complaints where conciliation has failed or is not suitable. Where a complaint is justified, the DSC has the power to issue an action to remedy the situation.\nHealth Complaints Commissioner (HCC)The HCC hears complaints about health services providers such as doctors, dentists and surgeons if the complaint has not been resolved directly with the health service provider.\nVictorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission (VEOHRC)The VEOHRC hears disputes in relation to equal opportunity, discrimination and any infringement of human rights.\n13_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   426 17/10/2017   4:03 PM",

Kristen Hilton, the \nVEOHRC Commissioner, has said that if girls are  prevented from wearing shorts and pants to  \nschool, this could amount to  unlawful discrimination. \nThe VEOHRC has said that school policies should allow girls the option to  choose what \nuniform they wish to  wear, including pants or shorts. A  discrimination claim in relation to  \nuniform school policies can be lodged with the VEOHRC.

The  courts are  arranged in a court hierarchy.\nBoth state  courts and federal courts have  jurisdiction to  hear certain types of civil disputes. Because \ncivil disputes often involve  a combination of both state  law and federal law,  many of the state  courts have  \njurisdiction to  hear matters arising under federal/uni00A0law.\nSource 1 The Victorian and Commonwealth Court hierachies\nThe role of/uni00A0the Victorian/uni00A0courts\nCivil disputes often arise, even  though there are  laws  which set down guidelines for  acceptable behaviour. \nWhen civil disputes arise, they need to  be resolved. \nThe courts are  the main dispute resolution body in Victoria. However, given the vast range of dispute \nresolution bodies and methods available to  the parties to  resolve a civil dispute, and the costs involved in \nusing the court system, having a full civil trial or hearing to  decide on liability is often considered a last \nresort for  parties.\nThe role of the Victorian courts in resolving disputes can generally be described as having two  \nseparate features:/uni00A0\n\u2022 determining the liability of a party\u2022 deciding on the remedy (if required).\nThese will be explored in more detail in this topic.\nDetermine liability\nIf a plainti\ufb00 sues a defendant in court, then it is the role of the courts to  determine whether the defendant \nis liable and, if  so, to what extent that defendant is liable. This means that the judge or magistrate (or jury \nif there is one) will consider all of  the evidence that is put during trial. They  will determine whether the \nplainti\ufb00, on the balance of probabilities (being the standard of proof in civil disputes), has established \nor proven that the defendant caused the loss or harm su\ufb00ered by  the plainti\ufb00. This is often called deciding \nthe facts, and the judge or magistrate (or jury) is the decider of facts. \nThe decider of facts may  also have  to determine whether the defendant is 100 per cent liable for  the \nplainti\ufb00\u2019s loss or harm. For  example, if the defendant has claimed that the plainti\ufb00 is partly responsible, \nthen \nthis may  reduce the defendant\u2019s liability. Similarly, if the plainti\ufb00 has sued more than one party, then balance of \nprobabilities    \nthe standard of proof in civil disputes.

For example, there are rules \naround which party is to present their case \ufb01rst (generally, the plainti\ufb00), though the judge does have power to change the rules of procedure. The Evidence Act 2008 (Vic) also establishes laws around what evidence is to be accepted. For example, a witness is not able to give evidence of an opinion to prove a certain fact. At a \ufb01nal hearing or trial, witnesses give evidence either orally or in writing.\nAs part of the court\u2019s role in determining liability, it/uni00A0will:\n\u2022 provide specialisation and expertise in the type of dispute it is hearing \u2013 For example, the \nSupreme Court, being the highest court in the Victorian court hierarchy, deals with major complex cases such as large commercial disputes and class actions, whereas the Magistrates\u2019 Court deals with minor civil disputescounterclaim   \na separate claim made by the defendant in response to the plaintiff\u2019s claim (and heard at the same time by the court)\ncase management   \na method used by courts and tribunals to control the progress of legal cases more effectively and efficiently.

The trial commenced on 29 October 2012 and concluded on 24 October/uni00A02013.\nShortly before 25 July 2014, His Honour Justice Croft of \nthe Supreme Court notified the parties that he intended to deliver judgment on that day.

The court can also award the successful party their costs (though it is usually the case that not all costs are recoverable), and interest on any damages amount that might have accrued.\nIn a civil dispute, either the judge or the jury may be required to assess damages (that is, calculate \nthe amount of damages, normally based on evidence that is presented by both parties about what the damages amount is). However, in defamation cases (where the plainti\ufb00 is suing for untrue statements made about him or her which have lowered the plainti\ufb00\u2019s standing in the community), only the judge can assess damages.\nIt is often the case that the court will hand down a written judgment about the reasons why it has come \nto the decision it has. Many of these judgments are publicly available. If the parties settle the case, they may either obtain orders from the court which dismisses or discontinues the case, or they may ask the judge to make orders in the terms they have agreed, although the judge can refuse to make any particular order the parties want. In the case of a class action, the judge must approve any terms of settlement.\nThe legal case below is an example of a class action dispute that reached a settlement agreement \nbefore a remedy was ordered by the court.defamation  \na type of tort which involves the action of damaging a person\u2019s personal or professional reputation in the community through the communication of false and untrue statements or information\nThe civil jurisdiction of/uni00A0the Victorian/uni00A0courts\nEach of the courts in Victoria has speci\ufb01c jurisdiction or power (authority) to hear and determine civil \ndisputes.

That means it is not able to hear any appeals from other courts.\nCounty/uni00A0Court of Victoria\nOriginal jurisdiction\nThe jurisdiction of the County Court for civil claims is unlimited. This means that there is no upper or lower limit of its jurisdiction, and it can hear claims of any amount.\nParties can choose to have their case heard in either the County Court or the Supreme Court. In civil \ncases, they have a choice of trial by a judge alone or by a judge and jury (six jurors). Many cases, in particular personal injury cases, are heard in the County Court because it is generally more expensive to take a case to the Supreme Court; though many of the more complex cases are heard in the Supreme/uni00A0Court.\nAppellate jurisdiction\nThe County Court does not have the jurisdiction to hear appeals in civil matters except where an Act of Parliament speci\ufb01cally provides for appeals to be heard in the County Court. For example, certain appeals under the Children, Y outh and Families Act 2005 (Vic) can be made to the County Court (such as an appeal against an order made by the Children\u2019s Court in relation to a therapeutic treatment order, which requires a child to participate in a treatment program).\nSupreme Court of Victoria (Trial Division)\nOriginal jurisdiction\nThe Trial Division\u2019s jurisdiction for civil claims is unlimited. This means, like the County Court, the Supreme Court can hear claims of any amount.

Obudho often appeared as DJ. In 2011, Obudho\u2019s wife and business partner contacted Patty Malones Bar Pty Ltd, the owner of Inflation Nightclub, about hiring the basement for a night in October 2011. Five days before the event, Patty Malones cancelled the booking after learning that the proposed event was to be an African music/uni00A0event.\nObudho and two others issued a claim in VCAT, claiming that Patty Malones was \ndiscriminating against them, having cancelled the services based on race. VCAT ultimately held that Patty Malones had discriminated against Obudho and the two other applicants, but dismissed the claims for compensation. Obudho appealed to the Trial Division of the Supreme Court (as did Patty Malones against VCAT\u2019s decision). One of the grounds for appeal by Obudho was that VCAT had failed to consider his claim for economic and non-economic loss, including loss because of personal upset and humiliation that he suffered as a result of the discrimination.\nJustice Emerton of the Supreme Court upheld \nObudho\u2019s appeal and found there was evidence of both economic and non-economic loss. She ordered that Patty Malones pay Obudho $13 000 for loss suffered by him. She dismissed Patty Malones\u2019 appeal.LEGAL \nCASE\nSource 5 Mr Obudho, a DJ, was vindicated by a Supreme \nCourt judgment after appealing a decision of/uni00A0VCAT.\nSupreme Court of Victoria (Court of/uni00A0Appeal)\nThe Court of Appeal, in its appellate jurisdiction, hears appeals from the County Court or Supreme Court \non questions of law, questions of fact or the amount of damages awarded.

  "Page 448": "436  UNIT  2 SANCTIONS, REMEDIES AND RIGHTSTHE ROLE OF THE JURY IN A/uni00A0CIVIL/uni00A0TRIAL 13.8 \nAs discussed in  Cha pter/uni00A011, the jury system is a trial by peers. The jury must listen to all the evidence and \nmake a decision based on the facts. In a civil case the jury considers the evidence having regard to the law \nthat is explained to them by the judge, and decides who is in the/uni00A0wrong.\nWhen is a jury used in civil trials?\nUnlike some criminal cases, there is no automatic right to a jury in a civil/uni00A0trial. For example:\n\u2022 in the Magistrates\u2019 Court, and in appeal cases, there is no/uni00A0jury\u2022 in the County Court and the Supreme Court, a jury is optional. If either party wants a jury, then they \nmust request a jury trial. They must also pay the fees associated with it (though a judge is able to still \norder that the trial be by judge alone). \nIt is also possible for the judge to require a jury for a civil trial. If this is the case, the state will pay for \nthe jury. It is not common for a judge to request a jury trial.\nCivil jury trials are rare, largely because of the fees involved, and often because civil trials are so \ncomplex that parties will elect to have a trial by judge alone. Juries, however, are sometimes used in \ndefamation/uni00A0cases. In the legal case below, a jury was requested by the plainti\ufb00s.\nJury trial despite complex issues in the/uni00A0case\nHumphris v Connecteast Nominee Company Pty Ltd (No 2)/uni00A0[2016] VSC 419 \n(27 July/uni00A02016)\nIn this case, the plaintiffs requested that the mode of trial be by judge and jury. The claim \nbrought by the plaintiffs related to negligence and nuisance caused by EastLink (a toll road in Melbourne\u2019s eastern suburbs). The plaintiffs in the case were self-represented.\nThe defendants sought an order that \nthe trial be heard by a judge alone. The defendants referred to the complex issues of law and fact, the large volumes of written material that needed to be considered, and the length of time and resources that would be spent if the jury needed to be discharged.\nAssociate Justice Daly of the Supreme \nCourt, \u2018with some hesitation\u2019, dismissed the defendants\u2019 application. She decided she would not lightly interfere with the right of a self-represented party to a trial by jury. Her Honour referred to the fact that previous jury trials were able to deal with complex and detailed evidence.

  "Page 449": "437  CHAPTER  13 REMEDIESComposition of/uni00A0a civil/uni00A0trial\nThere are six jurors in a civil jury in the County Court and the Supreme Court. Each juror is randomly \nselected from the Victorian electoral roll. Up to two extra jurors can be selected if the trial is expected to be lengthy, though two jurors will be discharged once it comes to deliberating. This means only six jurors will be involved in deciding the verdict.\n\u2192 GOING FURTHER\nJury challenges\nThe parties have some influence over the composition of the jury. They can do this by challenging some of the jurors before they are empanelled. The plaintiff and the defendant are entitled to a limited number of peremptory challenges each. Peremptory challenges are challenges without a reason. A/uni00A0peremptory challenge in a civil trial is made by striking the name or number of the potential juror from the list of persons to be selected to serve on the jury. There can be an unlimited number of challenges for cause; that is, challenges with a reason.\nRole of/uni00A0the civil/uni00A0jury\nThe role of a civil jury is to consider the facts of the case and decide who is most likely in the wrong. Their decision is made on the balance of probabilities. If a unanimous verdict cannot be reached (i.e. one in which all six jurors agree), then a majority verdict of up to \ufb01ve out of six will be accepted. If present, a civil jury may also be required to decide on the amount of damages to be awarded. In defamation cases, only a judge can decide the amount of damages.\nJurors are not required to give reasons for their decision (unlike a judge or magistrate). Therefore, the \nparties will not know the basis upon which the jurors have decided, or even know whether the jurors have understood the evidence, the legal issues, or the submissions made by the parties.\nLike criminal juries, there are obligations on civil juries in relation to gathering research and evidence. \nPenalties apply to jurors who make enquiries for the purposes of obtaining information about anything related to the trial (for example, using the internet to search for information, or viewing or inspecting a place that is relevant to the trial).\nIn conducting their role, juries are seen to ensure justice is administered in line with community \nstandards, rather than in line with the views of a small number of people (that is, judges). The use of the jury system also enables the community to participate in the administration of justice, which can enhance the con\ufb01dence of the community that justice is being achieved.\nThe jury system also seeks to uphold equality and impartiality. It does this by ensuring that jury \nmembers have no knowledge of a party or a witness, have no biases or preconceived notions, and are able to make a decision based on facts, and not based on any biased views that may be held by/uni00A0them.\nThe legal case on the next page is an example of a negligence case that was heard by a jury.unanimous verdict   \na verdict or decision \nwhere all the jury members are in agreement and decide the same way (e.g. they all agree the accused is guilty)/uni00A0\nmajority verdict   \nall but one of the \nmembers of the jury agree with the decision\n13_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   437 17/10/2017   4:03 PM",

  "Page 452": "440  UNIT  2 SANCTIONS, REMEDIES AND RIGHTSTHE PURPOSES AND TYPES  OF REMEDIES 13.9 \nIn a civil case,  the plainti\ufb00 normally seeks a remedy. Put simply, a remedy is a way  in which a court can \nright the wrong that has occurred to  the plainti\ufb00.\nThe purposes of/uni00A0remedies\nThe general purpose of civil remedies is to  restore (as much  as possible), the party who has su\ufb00ered \nloss or injury to  the position they were  in before the loss or injury occurred. This is usually in \nthe form  of a payment of money, known as damages. If a person is owed  an amount of money, they can \nmake a claim through the courts. An injured person may  claim a sum (amount) of money to  compensate \nfor any pain or su\ufb00ering incurred as a result of the civil/uni00A0wrong.\nThere are  two main types of remedies: damages and injunctions. These will be further explored in \nthis topic. \nDamages\nDamages is an amount of money to  be paid by  the defendant to  the plainti\ufb00, in satisfaction of a claim \nmade by  the plainti\ufb00 (it can also be sought by  a defendant who makes a counterclaim). The  main purpose \nof damages is to  compensate the plainti\ufb00  for losses su\ufb00ered. If there is any  permanent damage, such as \nthe loss of  a limb, it will not be possible to  physically restore the injured party to  how  they were  before the \ninjury. Damages are  therefore given to  try to  compensate for  the loss or injury su\ufb00ered.\nThere are  four main categories of damages as shown in Source 1:injunction  \na remedy in the form \nof a court order to  \ndo something or not to do something. An \ninjunction is designed to prevent a person \ndoing harm (or further harm), or to  rectify \nsome wrong\nSource 1 Types of damages\nDraw up a table in your notebook which showsthe name of damages, the purpose of each, and an example of when it might be awarded. This will help you distinguish between/uni00A0them.Study/uni00A0tip\nCompensatory damages\nCompensatory damages are  the main type of damages usually sought. There are  three types of  \ncompensatory damages:\n\u2022 special or speci\ufb01c damages \u2013 These are  awarded to  compensate the injured party (usually the \nplainti\ufb00) for  items that can be calculated objectively and exactly; for  example, loss of  wages,  medical \nexpenses and hospital expenses.\n\u2022 general damages \u2013 These are  awarded to  compensate the plainti\ufb00  for pain and su\ufb00ering. These \ncannot be calculated objectively because they include consideration of the extent of the plainti\ufb00\u2019s \nemotional su\ufb00ering and loss of enjoyment of life. The  plainti\ufb00\u2019s counsel may  make submissions \nabout the appropriate amount.\n\u2022 aggravated  damages  \u2013 Aggravated damages are  awarded to  compensate the plainti\ufb00 further if the \ncourt believes that the defendant\u2019s conduct injured the plainti\ufb00\u2019s feelings by  causing humiliation and \ninsult.counsel \na lawyer appearing in court to  represent a \npartyCompensatory\ndamagesNominal\ndamagesExemplary\ndamagesContemptuous\ndamages\nSpecific\ndamagesGeneral\ndamagesAggravated\ndamages\n13_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   440 17/10/2017   4:03 PM",
  "Page 453": "441  CHAPTER  13 REMEDIESNominal damages\nNominal damages are awarded by a court if the court believes that the defendant has infringed the rights \nof the plainti\ufb00, but the plainti\ufb00 did not su\ufb00er any actual loss. The court therefore awards a very small amount as compensation.\nThe legal case below is an example of nominal damages being awarded in a contract case.

The parties fell out and the defendants sought to terminate the contracts. The plaintiffs sued them for breach of contract and claimed significant sums of damages.\nThe Queensland Supreme Court found that the defendants had breached the contract. \nHowever, the Court found that the plaintiffs had failed to prove that they had suffered loss and damage.

They were charged with obstructing a police officer, but the charge was dismissed after a trial in 2010.

  "Page 461": "449  CHAPTER  14 RECENT CIVIL CASESThe defendants in the case are part of Bauer Media Group \u2013 a multinational media company based \nin Hamburg, Germany. Bauer Media Group manages a portfolio of more than 600 magazines, 400 digital \nproducts and 50 radio and TV stations around the world. Its Australian division publishes a number of well-known magazines, including The Australian Women\u2019s Weekly, Woman\u2019s Day, Harper\u2019s Bazaar, NW, OK \nMagazine, New Weekly, Cosmopolitan, and Australian Gourmet Traveller.\nInformation sought about Rebel Wilson\nFrom mid-2012, Bauer Media began conducting research on Rebel Wilson, wanting to publish a magazine article about various aspects of her life. At that time, a Woman\u2019s Day reporter by the name of Shari Nementzik contacted a person who had left a comment on the magazine\u2019s website about Wilson. The person who left the comment claimed to have attended school with Wilson and said she had lied about various details of her life (including her age). The comment (posted on 25 October 2012) suggested Wilson was actually 33 years old rather than 26. Nementzik sent an email to the anonymous person (referred to as a \u2018source\u2019) who left the comment asking if she would be interested in having a chat (see Source 3).The Australasian Legal \nInformation Institute (AustLII) is an excellent resource to find recent court judgments.

In one, the source \nwrote that she wanted maximum payment for the information she would give about Wilson. In another, \nNementzik referred to some research she had conducted that indicated Wilson may indeed be 33 (and queried whether Wilson was lying). During the court case, it was revealed that at some stage Bauer Media raised concerns that publishing the articles may be problematic as it was questionable whether Wilson had in fact lied.\nPublication of articles\nDespite concerns raised in 2013 about the accuracy of the information provided by the source, in 2015 Bauer Media published a series of eight articles about Rebel Wilson in Woman\u2019s Day and other online publications. According to Bauer Media\u2019s website, Woman\u2019s Day has a weekly readership of more than 1/uni00A0300 000, which made it \u2018Australia\u2019s number one weekly magazine\u2019 .\nIn an article titled \u2018Just Who is the REAL Rebel?\u2019 (published in May 2015), Nementzik quoted a source \nand claimed Wilson\u2019s real name was Melanie Elizabeth Bownds and that she was 36 years of age. The article also claimed Rebel Wilson had said she was 29 years of age and that she had fabricated many aspects of her life, including key facts about her upbringing.\nThe publication of this and other articles (a total of eight publications) coincided with the release of \nthe movie Pitch Perfect 2 (a sequel to the popular 2012 release Pitch Perfect). \nIt was later revealed that in the days leading up to the publication of the articles, concerns had been \nraised within Bauer Media about calling Wilson a liar.\n14_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   449 17/10/2017   4:32 PM",
  "Page 462": "450  UNIT  2 SANCTIONS, REMEDIES AND/uni00A0RIGHTSClaim issued in the Supreme Court\nIn May 2016, Wilson issued a writ in the Supreme Court of Victoria identifying Bauer Media Pty Ltd and \nBauer Media Australia Pty Ltd as defendants. In a statement of claim accompanying the writ, Wilson claimed she had been defamed. The purpose of defamation laws is to protect character and reputation. A person whose reputation has been damaged (that is, a person who has been defamed), may be able to sue for defamation.\nTo establish a claim for defamation, Wilson needed to prove that:\n\u2022 the statements made in the articles published about her were defamatory (i.e. defamed her)\n\u2022 the articles contained false statements about her which injured her reputation\u2022 the statements referred directly to her\u2022 the statements had been published (communicated to other people) by the defendants.\nWilson claimed the articles portrayed her as a liar who had invented stories about herself to become \nsuccessful. Wilson also claimed that her reputation was ruined as a result of the articles, and that she had \nbeen publicly humiliated and embarrassed by them. In particular, she said that because of the articles, she lost the opportunity to earn income by acting in feature \ufb01lms in the US.\nIt was reported that Wilson sought $5.893 million in special damages (i.e. money awarded to \ncompensate for items that can be calculated objectively, such as lost earnings), and $1.2 million in general damages (i.e. for pain and su\ufb00ering caused). In total, Wilson sought just over $7 million in damages. She also sought interest and costs.\nFinally, in addition to damages, Wilson sought a permanent injunction to stop Bauer Media from \npublishing the articles again.\nDispute resolution bodies \ninvolved in the case\nWilson issued her claim in the Supreme Court of \nVictoria, which has unlimited jurisdiction to hear civil disputes. The County Court has jurisdiction to hear a $7 million claim, but the Magistrates\u2019 Court does not.\nBodies such as Consumer A\ufb00airs Victoria and the \no\ufb03ce of ombudsman do not have jurisdiction (power) to hear a defamation claim, nor does the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal.\nThis dispute was resolved in court. A trial was held \nin May and June 2017, with a jury of six members \u2013 in this instance, all female. The jury in this case was the decider of facts, meaning they had the responsibility of hearing the evidence and making a decision about whether Wilson had proved her claim and whether the defendant was successful in relation to any defence raised.\nJuries in defamation cases decide on liability, but they do not decide the remedy. This is because of \nsection 22 of the Defamation Act 2005 (Vic), which states that the jury is not to determine damages (in the past juries did award damages, but the amounts were inconsistent, and sometimes extremely high.

The defendants wanted to rely on the evidence of a genealogist to prove that this wasn\u2019t true. The judge declined to allow this evidence, saying that whether Rebel was related to Walt was not a relevant issue during the trial.\nDid you/uni00A0know?\nSource 4 Rebel Wilson with part of her legal \nteam in Melbourne during her trial.\n14_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   450 17/10/2017   4:32 PM",

She broke down while giving \nevidence about the lies contained in the articles, saying \u2018this group of people who don\u2019t know me want to \nrip me to shreds on information they know is false\u2019 .\nThe daily events of the trial were reported enthusiastically by the media and during the trial Wilson\u2019s \nbehaviour was at times reported as \u2018bizarre\u2019 (e.g. she brie\ufb02y rapped an Oscar acceptance speech while giving evidence and told personal anecdotes about her interest in boys).\nThe defendants denied the allegations made by Wilson on various grounds. They argued that Wilson \nwas not \ufb01red from her movie roles as a result of the articles. They also denied that Wilson had actually su\ufb00ered any loss.\nThe defendants also raised a number of defences that can be used to defend a defamation claim in \nrelation to one or more of the publications. These include the defence of justi\ufb01cation and triviality:\n\u2022 T he justi\ufb01cation defence can be used where the defendants claim that a statement that is made is \nsubstantially true.\n\u2022 T he triviality defence can be used where the defendants believe that the circumstances of the \npublication were such that the plainti\ufb00 was unlikely to sustain any harm.\nMethods of dispute resolution and their \nappropriateness\nIt is not clear whether the parties attempted \nto resolve the case through mediation prior to going to trial, but the Supreme Court generally requires parties to mediate before trial, so it is likely that mediation occurred. Whatever the case, it is clear that this was not successful.\nThe Supreme Court generally does not \norder parties to participate in conciliation to resolve a dispute (preferring mediation). Given there was no contract between the parties, the parties would not have been required to participate in arbitration to resolve the dispute, unless they agreed to do so themselves.\nSince the parties were unable to settle \nthe dispute between themselves, the only available option was to proceed to trial. In this instance, a jury was the decider of facts.\nAfter two days of deliberation, the jury found in favour of Wilson. Juries do not have to provide reasons \nfor their decision, so the reasons why they found in favour of Wilson are not clear. \nA jury trial can be an appropriate means of resolving a dispute, and it is often used in defamation \ncases. A strong argument in favour of using a jury is that a jury ensures that justice is administered in line with community standards, rather than in line with the views of a small number of people (i.e. judges).\nThe fact that members of the community form the jury and participate in the trial helps to ensure \nfairness and equality. The decision is made by people who are not connected with any of the parties, which reduces the chances of bias.cross-examination \nthe questioning of a witness called by the other side in a legal case\nmediation  \na method of dispute resolution, using an independent third party (the mediator) to help the disputing parties reach a resolution\nconciliation   \na method of dispute resolution which uses an independent third party (i.e. the conciliator) to help the disputing parties reach a resolution\narbitration   \na method of dispute resolution in which an independent person (known as an arbitrator) is appointed to listen to both sides of a dispute and make a decision that is legally binding on the parties.

Copies of the documents are normally provided to the other partyIn this case:\n\u2022 The directions and orders given by the Supreme Court would have allowed each party an opportunity \nto present their case and rebut the other side\u2019s case. For example, in this case a number of emails \nwere used as evidence about Bauer Media\u2019s concerns at the time they decided to publish (e.g. whether \nthere was any risk with publishing the articles). Those emails would have been seen by Wilson and her legal team before trial during the process of discovery. The discovery process thus ensured that relevant documents such as these were not withheld from the plainti\ufb00.\n\u2022 The rules of procedure allowed the parties to present their case. There are general rules of procedure \nabout which party presents their case \ufb01rst at trial, though the Court does have the power to decide on the rules in each particular case. Each party was entitled to, and did, call evidence, make submissions to the Court and address the judge and the jury.\n\u2022 T he jury was the decider of facts. The jury would have been required to consider the evidence and \nthe law to come to a verdict. However, juries do not have to give reasons for their decision, therefore it is unclear whether the jury has properly considered the evidence, or understood the law, when arriving at a verdict. This may be seen by some as unfair.\n\u2022 T he laws relating to defamation were properly applied. This includes the fact that the judge decided \non the amount of damages. This means the most legally experienced person in the courtroom, the judge, decided on the remedy.\n\u2022 T here was a timely resolution of the case. The claim was issued in May 2016, and a \ufb01nal judgment \nwas handed down in September 2017. This may be seen as timely, having regard to the complexity and size of the dispute. Some, however, may see this as too long to reach a decision even in this complex case. The impact of a delay can also be greater for some parties than for others.\n\u2022 Both parties had adequate legal representation. This assisted in ensuring a fair trial.\nSource 7 Rebel Wilson with some of her legal representatives during trial\n14_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   453 17/10/2017   4:33 PM",
  "Page 466": "454  UNIT  2 SANCTIONS, REMEDIES AND/uni00A0RIGHTS\u2022 J ustice Dixon handed down a number of rulings during trial. For example, the parties had to \ufb01le \nexpert evidence (evidence which is given by a person who is a specialist in their \ufb01eld) by a certain \ndate. The defendants tried to rely on an expert report which was not \ufb01led by that time. Justice Dixon decided that the defendants were not permitted to do so, partly because they should have done so earlier, and \ufb01ling the report so late would have hampered the plainti\ufb00\u2019s opportunity to consider the report and respond.\nEquality\nThe concept of equality suggests that all people should be equal before the law regardless of who they are. For equality to be achieved, every person in society who is involved in a civil claim should have the same opportunity to present their case without advantage or disadvantage.\nIn this case:\n\u2022 T he judge was required to act impartially and without bias, and have no connections with the \nparties. In overseeing the trial, Justice Dixon would have been required to make decisions along the way in an unbiased manner.\n\u2022 The plainti\ufb00 and the defendants both had experienced legal representation. The availability of legal \nrepresentation to both parties will ensure that they equally have the ability to present their case. One party being unrepresented may result in signi\ufb01cant inequality.\n\u2022 T he jury members would have been required to have had no connection or relationship with the \nparties, and would have been required to decide on the facts and not on any other matter. However, given the high pro\ufb01le of this case, and the high pro\ufb01le of the plainti\ufb00, it is possible that one or more of the jury members would have known of Wilson or of the publications in question before trial. This prior knowledge could have in\ufb02uenced jury members, but given they do not have to give reasons for their decision, there is no way of knowing whether any prior knowledge in\ufb02uenced their decision.\n\u2022 Both parties had the right to appeal.\nAccess\nThe concept of access suggests that everyone covered by the legal system and its laws should have equal access to the agencies and institutions of that system. They should be given every opportunity to understand their legal rights and pursue their legal claims in court. For access to be achieved, the civil justice system relies on defendants having good advice and legal representation. Those who satisfy the tests for assistance imposed by Victoria Legal Aid can have legal representation at no charge. This is essential for parties attempting to navigate their way through complex legal processes.\nA civil trial includes strict processes for sharing evidence between the parties, especially for the key \ndocuments that will be used as evidence to the trial. This helps legal counsel on both sides prepare for trial.\nIn this case:\n\u2022 It is likely that the use of mediation will increase access to justice, as it provides the parties with an alternative method of resolving the dispute outside trial. However, it is not clear that mediation was held in this instance.\n\u2022 Co sts may be a factor in determining whether access to justice can be achieved. While there is no \nsuggestion that either party cannot a\ufb00ord to pay the costs, both parties are likely to be out of pocket for their costs. It is likely that all of the parties had the legal funds to pay for their costs, but another person in Wilson\u2019s situation may not have been able to a\ufb00ord the costs and therefore may not have pursued the case.When discussing the \nprinciples of justice, it is important that you explain how  a particular \nprinciple of justice is achieved for each point you make. Avoid simply saying \u2018legal representation achieves equality\u2019; instead, say something like \u2018legal representation achieves equality by allowing both parties to present their case through an objective legal representative\u2019.Study/uni00A0tip\n14_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   454 17/10/2017   4:33 PM",

The VCAT members hearing the case \nwere Justice Greg Garde AO RFD, the President of VCAT, and Senior Member Margaret/uni00A0Baird.\nThe hearing was highly contested and involved a number of signi\ufb01cant and \ncomplex issues that VCAT needed to decide on. After the hearing, the group applicants even made an application for Justice Greg Garde to recuse himself (i.e. step down from hearing the case) on the basis that he was biased and his decision would be unfair. That application was dismissed.\nA number of other procedural matters were also raised by the group applicants, \nwhere they raised a series of concerns about the conduct of the hearing, suggesting they were denied procedural fairness or had been disadvantaged in preparing and presenting their/uni00A0case.\nAn example of one of the objections is set out below. It is an extract from \nVCAT\u2019s decision in the case. Mr Balzola was the solicitor for the group applicants.\nVCAT handed down its decision on 6 August 2015.

While the statements of expert evidence \nin question were filed towards the end of the time frame allowed by the Tribunal under Expert Evidence Practice Note PNVCAT2 (\u2018PNVCAT2\u2019), nonetheless, they were filed and served within time. The permit applicant and the responsible authority complied with the requirements of PNVCAT2.\n36 It should be noted that some of the material filed and served by the group applicants following \nthe Tribunal\u2019s order dated 1 December 2014 was filed out of time. Neither the responsible authority nor the permit applicant objected to the receipt of this evidence by the Tribunal despite late service by the group applicants.EXTRACT\nRuling on the procedural matters and objections raised by the group applicants, VCAT dismissed those \nconcerns. It noted that VCAT takes its duty of fairness very seriously, and seeks to ensure that all \nparties receive a fair hearing, and that all parties are treated with courtesy and respect. VCAT found that while there were frequent submissions that there had been disadvantage, the applicants did not provide evidence about what this was, and how it a\ufb00ected their ability to present their/uni00A0case.\nIn reviewing the merits of the decision of the Council to grant the permit, VCAT decided that the \ndecision was appropriate. VCAT stated that it had not been presented with evidence that the concerns around social impact were warranted. It also said there was no evidence or submissions that the fears about the proposed mosque would become reality. It said that there was no evidence of abuse, harassment, intimidation, or loss of wellbeing or social cohesion in relation to the operation of Islamic worship places \nin Bendigo or in any other location in Victoria and beyond. VCAT also said that \u2018the speculation of the group applicants associated with growth of Islamic education or other facilities is not persuasive\u2019 .\nsocial cohesion  \na term used to describe the willingness of members of a society to cooperate with each other in order to survive and prosper\u2018AO RFD\u2019 means that Justice Garde is an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) \u2013 he received this award under the Australian Honours system.

That is the case \neven though there might be people who come to Bendigo for that reason alone. The Muslim population associated with the permit application is not large when considered in the context of an estimated 2013 population of Greater Bendigo of over 100,000 people, and a projected 2030 population of 143,685. The Muslim population, as well as that of other faiths, will grow as a result of a number of factors \u2013 particularly population growth and not merely as a result of access to a place of worship.EXTRACT\nSource 5 Former Greater Bendigo City \nCouncil Mayor Cr Peter Cox \u2013 VCAT\u2019s decision was welcomed by Greater Bendigo City Council.\nTwo of the group applicants \u2013 Julie Hoskin and Kathleen Howard \u2013 would ultimately appeal the VCAT \ndecision.\nMethods of/uni00A0dispute resolution and their appropriatenes s\nIn this case, VCAT was reviewing a decision made by a responsible authority.

That is, the case needed to be heard and determined by VCAT for it to make a binding decision on whether to a\ufb03rm, vary or set aside the decision by the Council to approve the permit. Arbitration is also not an appropriate dispute resolution method where a decision of a council is reviewed.\nVCAT does have the power, at any time, to invite a responsible authority to reconsider the decision, \nthough in this case the matter went to a full hearing, and a binding decision was/uni00A0made.\nRemedies awarded and their appropriateness\nThe objectors in this case were not seeking remedies (such as an injunction or damages).

In this case, the decision was appealed by two of the objectors. \nCourt of/uni00A0Appeal\nBecause the President of VCAT heard the application and made a decision, any appeal by the group objectors needed to be made to the Court of Appeal. Leave (consent) was required by the Court of Appeal to appeal. \nAny appeals from VCAT are limited to appeals on questions of law.

The \nfocus of the appeal was on the way that VCAT dealt with the alleged signi\ufb01cant social e\ufb00ects that they \nfeared the proposed mosque would have on the community.\nThe Court of Appeal decided that the application for leave to appeal should be refused. It found that \nthe grounds of appeal did not raise questions of law, and the grounds had no prospects of success for \nvarious reasons.  An extract is provided below.\nHoskin v Greater Bendigo City Council [2015] VSCA 350 \n(16 December/uni00A02015)\n134 It was open to the Tribunal in these circumstances to fail to be satisfied that the possibility of a \nrelevant adverse social effect was material unless the group objectors put forward some objective \nfactual basis on which to conclude that the risks they feared were or might be significant.EXTRACT\nHigh/uni00A0Court\nIn 2016, Hoskin sought special leave to appeal to the High Court.

In each case, this assessment is made \non the evidence available. \nFairness\nThe concept of fairness suggests that the law should be properly applied to all people regardless of who \nthey are. Every person should be given an opportunity to know the case that is being put against them and \nto present their case. For fairness to be achieved, the civil justice system relies on fair legal processes and fair hearings.\nIn this/uni00A0case:\n\u2022 Section 97 of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 1998 (Vic) states that VCAT must act fairly and according to the merits of the case \u2013 VCAT found that there was no evidence of procedural fairness being denied to the group applicants.\n\u2022 T he parties were given the opportunity to present their case \u2013 VCAT found that the group applicants \nhad been given every opportunity to present their case, and there was even an adjournment allowed for them to obtain expert evidence.\n\u2022 T he laws were properly applied \u2013 The case was considered by VCAT, the Court of Appeal and the \nHigh Court, and there was no \ufb01nding by the appeal courts that VCAT improperly made its decision.fairness \none of the principles of justice; fairness means having fair processes and a fair hearing (e.g. the parties in a legal case should have an opportunity to know the facts of the case and have the opportunity to present their side of events; and the pre-hearing and hearing (or trial) processes should be fair and impartial)\nequality  \none of the principles of justice; equality means people should be equal before the law and have the same opportunity to present their case as anyone else, without advantage or disadvantage \naccess \none of the principles of justice; access means that all people should be able to understand their legal rights and pursue their case\n14_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   461 17/10/2017   4:33 PM",
  "Page 474": " UNIT  2 SANCTIONS, REMEDIES AND/uni00A0RIGHTS 462The points provided \nare not the only ones you can make about fairness, equality and access. Can you think beyond the points provided about how these principles were achieved in this case?Study/uni00A0tip\u2022 T here was a timely resolution of the case, based on the complexity and size of the dispute \u2013 In this \ncase the last day of the hearing was on 11 May 2015, and a decision was made by VCAT on 6 August \n2015. Given the size and complexity of the issues, this can be seen to be a reasonable time in which VCAT handed down its decision. The Court of Appeal heard the leave application on 6 November 2015, and handed down its decision on 16 December 2015. There was some delay in between appeals, which may be seen to be unfair in relation to the building and development of the facilities and the impact on the parties in obtaining a resolution.\n\u2022 Reas ons are given for the decision \u2013 In this case, VCAT and the Court of Appeal provided substantial \nreasons for their decisions which enabled the parties to consider whether the decision was/uni00A0right.\nThe group objectors may have di\ufb00erent views about whether there was procedural fairness in the VCAT \nhearing, given the substantial submissions it made. For example, the group applicants raised a number of \nconcerns about the way the hearing was conducted, arguing that they were denied procedural fairness or had been prejudiced. This included the argument that expert evidence was \ufb01led out of time by the other side. VCAT in its decision rejected the claim that there was any procedural unfairness. \nEquality \nThe concept of equality suggests that all people should be equal before the law regardless of who they are. For equality to be achieved, every person in society who is involved in a civil claim should have the same opportunity to present their case without advantage or disadvantage. \nIn this/uni00A0case:\n\u2022 Both parties had legal representation \u2013 The availability of legal representation aims to ensure equality in the parties being able to present their/uni00A0cases.\n\u2022 An issue at VCAT was that the group applicants claimed that Justice Greg Garde was biased and partial \u2013 The claim was made after the last day of hearing and was in relation to letters that were sent on behalf of VCAT to the Secretary of Rights for Bendigo Residents Inc. The letters requested removal of publications on the group\u2019s website and Facebook page which were considered defamatory of Justice Garde and a Deputy President of VCAT. Justice Garde noted that he had no role or involvement in sending the letters, and wasn\u2019t aware of them until the application was made to remove him. The President concluded that there was no logical conclusion between the matter that had arisen and him being able to make a decision on the merits, and declined to disqualify himself.\n\u2022 There was no jury in this case \u2013 There was no risk of any bias arising from jury members.\n\u2022 T he group applicants also argued that because of a lack of procedural fairness, that they had been \nprejudiced or disadvantaged in preparing and presenting their case \u2013 VCAT did not \ufb01nd that there was \nanything to suggest that they were disadvantaged. It otherwise found that they had not been prejudiced.\nAccess\nThe concept of access suggests that everyone covered by the legal system and its laws should have equal access to the agencies and institutions of that system. They should be given every opportunity to understand their legal rights and pursue their legal claims in court. For access to be achieved, the civil justice system relies on defendants having good advice and legal representation. Those who satisfy the tests for assistance imposed by Victoria Legal Aid can have legal representation at no charge. This is essential for parties attempting to navigate through complex legal processes.\nIn a civil trial, there are strict processes for the sharing of evidence between the parties, especially the \nkey documents that will be used as evidence in the trial. This helps legal counsel on both sides prepare for/uni00A0trial.\nSource 6  \nAnti-mosque campaigner Julie Hoskin (left) was required to pay the other party\u2019s/uni00A0costs.\n14_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   462 17/10/2017   4:33 PM",

According \nto the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol (Refugee Convention), a refugee is de\ufb01ned/uni00A0as:\nAny person who owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, \nnationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his/her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself/herself of the protection of that country.\nIn recent decades, Australia has seen an increase in the number of asylum seekers embarking on \ndangerous boat voyages to reach the safety of Australia. In an attempt to reduce the number of refugee \nboats coming to Australia, both major Australian political parties (i.e. the Liberal Party and the Labor Party) have endorsed policies of o\ufb00shore processing of refugees; that is, diverting the boats to other countries for processing to decide if the passengers are genuine refugees. These o\ufb00shore processing centres are known as detention centres.\nIn Victoria in 2014, a class action (also known as a representative proceeding) was issued in the \nSupreme Court on behalf of persons detained at one of the detention centres maintained by Australia on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. \nThe class action was one of the biggest ever commenced in Victoria in relation to human rights, and \nsettled in June 2017 before a lengthy and complex trial commenced. \nIn this topic we will explore each of the following aspects of the Manus Island Detention Centre class \naction in detail, including:\n\u2022 an overview of the claim and the central facts of the/uni00A0case\u2022 dispute resolution bodies that were involved in the case\u2022 methods of dispute resolution and their appropriateness\u2022  remedies awarded and their appropriateness\n\u2022 possible avenues of/uni00A0appeal\u2022 the extent to which the principles of justice were achieved\n.\nOverview of/uni00A0the claim and central facts of/uni00A0the/uni00A0case\nAustralia provides protection to refugees, and is one of the few countries in our region that has signed \nthe Refugee Convention. The Refugee Convention sets out the rights of refugees and the legal obligations of states who have signed the Convention. This means that Australia has voluntarily agreed to be bound under international law to protect people \ufb02eeing persecution and to treat those seeking asylum equally.\nIn Australia, the law relating to refugees and asylum seekers is set out in the Migration Act 1958/uni00A0(Cth).\nManus Island and the/uni00A0detention/uni00A0centre\nManus Island is part of Manus Province in northern Papua New Guinea.

It is the largest island in Papua New Guinea.\nIn 2001, in response to the number of boats arriving in Australia, the Commonwealth Government \nintroduced a process by which asylum seekers on board unauthorised vessels would be intercepted \nand transferred to o\ufb00shore processing centres. One of those o\ufb00shore processing centres (i.e. detention centres) was located on Manus Island. A/uni00A0Memorandum of Understanding was signed between Papua New Guinea and Australia on 11 October 2011 which established the detention centre for the purposes of assessing people\u2019s claims. In addition, the Government also announced there would be a processing centre based in Nauru.

This is the only court in which the claim \ncould have been issued in Victoria, because it is a class action.\nThe matter was listed for trial, due to commence on 1 May 2017, and was expected to be one of the \nlargest trials concerning immigration detention in Australia. However, after some delays in the start date, the Supreme Court was informed on 14 June 2017 during a short hearing that the parties had agreed to a settlement of the matter, and that there was no need for a trial. Justice McDonald vacated the trial date (that is, the trial was abandoned). The defendants, as part of the settlement, have denied any liability (that is, they are not admitting the allegations, by agreeing to settle the claim). Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said that \u2018An anticipated six month legal battle for this case would have cost tens of millions of dollars in legal fees, along with an unknown outcome\u2019 . He went on to say that \u2018In such circumstances a settlement was considered a prudent outcome for Australian taxpayers\u2019 . \nHad the trial gone ahead, it would have been one of the largest concerning immigration detention. \nAccording to Slater and Gordon, there were over 200 000 discovered documents, 17 reports from experts, and 104 witness outlines (documents which provided an outline of the evidence of each witness).

  "Page 481": "469  CHAPTER  14 RECENT CIVIL  CASESbeen a number of cases where class actions have  been resolved by  the parties outside of trial, including \nthe class action relating to  Great Southern. In several  instances class actions have  been settled by  the \nparties after the trial. They  include class actions over  the Great Southern investment scheme and the Black \nSaturday bush\ufb01res.\nAs this claim was  commenced as a class action, the Supreme Court was  the most appropriate Victorian \ncourt to  hear the dispute and make a binding decision as to  liability. Ultimately, however, the parties \nthemselves reached an agreement as to  settlement, without the need for  the Court to  make a binding \ndecision.\nArbitration was  not an appropriate method of dispute resolution for  this claim, given it is a class action \nbetween parties. The  parties also did not agree  to arbitrate the dispute. \nRemedies awarded and their appropriateness\nThe remedy sought by  the plainti\ufb00  was  damages for  loss and injury su\ufb00ered by  the group members. \nOn 14 June 2017 it was  announced that the Commonwealth had agreed to  pay $70/uni00A0million in compensation \nplus costs, which some have  estimated to  be in the vicinity of  $20/uni00A0million. The  settlement was  approved by  \nthe Supreme Court of Victoria on 6 September 2017. This is because the dispute was  a class action, and \nunder the Supreme Court Act  1986 (Vic), the Supreme Court must approve any  settlement of class actions, \nincluding the way  the money will be distributed among the group members. \nThe purpose of damages is to  return the plainti\ufb00 and the group members back to  the position they \nwere  in before the loss occurred. Whether the damages, if approved by  the Court, can achieve its purpose \nin this case will in part depend on the nature and type of harm su\ufb00ered by  each of the asylum seekers. \nGiven it is possible that some of the detainees have  su\ufb00ered mental harm and long-term injuries, damages \nmay never be able to  return them to  the position they were  in before the harm occurred. \nThe e\ufb00ectiveness of damages may  also depend on how  long it will take  for any damages amount \nto be received by  the group members. This will depend on when there is a \ufb01nal distribution of the \nsettlement amount. \nPossible avenues of/uni00A0appeal\nAs this proceeding settled without the \nneed for  trial, there will be no need \nfor any appeal. However, if the case \ndid go  to trial, any  appeal would have  \nbeen heard by  the Court of Appeal, \nbut leave would have  been required for  an appeal to  have  been heard. \nAny appeals from the Court of Appeal would have  been heard by  the High Court of Australia, if it had \ngranted leave to  appeal.\nThe extent to/uni00A0which the/uni00A0principles of/uni00A0justice were \nachieved\nAn assessment of the extent to  which the principles of justice \u2013 i.e. fairness, equality and access \u2013 \nwere  achieved in the case of the Manus Island Detention Centre class action is provided below. \nFairness\nThe concept of fairness suggests that the law  should be properly applied to  all people regardless of who \nthey are.  Every person should be given an opportunity to  know the case that is being put against them and fairness \none of the principles of justice; fairness means having fair processes and a fair hearing (e.g. the parties in a legal case should have an opportunity to  know the \nfacts of the case and have the opportunity to present their side \nof events; and the pre-hearing and hearing (or trial) processes should be fair and impartial)\nequality  \none of the principles of justice; equality means people should be equal before the law and have the same opportunity to  present \ntheir case as anyone else, without advantage or disadvantage \naccess \none of the principles of justice; access means that all people should be able to  understand \ntheir legal rights and pursue their caseSource/uni00A08 The appeal route for this caseSupreme Court\n(Trial Division)Court of Appeal High Court\n14_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   469 17/10/2017   4:33 PM",

For fairness to be achieved, \nthe civil justice system relies on fair legal processes and fair hearings.\nIn this/uni00A0case:\n\u2022 The directions and orders given by the \nSupreme Court would have allowed each party an opportunity to present their case, and rebut the other side\u2019s case. In this case it appears that there was a substantial amount of evidence and documents obtained and exchanged by the parties, thus enabling the parties to know the case that was put against/uni00A0them.\n \u2022 Pr e-trial procedures such as mediation were \nordered, which would have allowed the parties an opportunity to resolve the case before trial. \n\u2022 T he parties were given an opportunity to settle without the need for a trial. In this case, the trial \nwas delayed at least twice, possibly to allow the parties an opportunity to engage in discussions about settlement without the need to go to/uni00A0trial.\n\u2022 T here was a timely resolution of the case, having regard to the complexity and size of the dispute. The \nclaim was issued in December 2014. There has been some delay in the matter going to trial; however this may be because of the size and complexity of the case, the number of group members, the number of defendants, and the issues that would have to have been resolved by the parties.\nEquality\nThe concept of equality suggests that all people should be equal before the law, regardless of who they are. Every person in society should also have the same opportunity to present their case without advantage or disadvantage. For equality to be achieved, the civil justice system relies on both parties being treated in the same/uni00A0way. \nIn this/uni00A0case:\n\u2022 T he plainti\ufb00\u2019s statement of claim elected trial by judge and jury \u2013 This means that a jury, if the case \nwent to trial, would have made a determination as to liability (but not damages).\n\u2022 T he jury would have been required to be impartial, unbiased and objective, and make a \ndetermination based on facts and not on any pre-conceived notions or bias \u2013 It would have been important that jury members had no pre-conceived views about the rights of refugees, the unauthorised arrival of asylum seekers, and the use of o\ufb00shore centres to process them. There have been signi\ufb01cant con\ufb02icting attitudes and views in Australia about the rights of refugees and Australia\u2019s policies towards the increasing number of people seeking asylum here. Given those con\ufb02icting attitudes, it would have been particularly important to ensure that the jury members brought an objective mind to the/uni00A0task.\n\u2022 T he judge, in overseeing the management of the case and pre-trial procedures, would have ensured \nequality by acting impartially and without/uni00A0bias.\n\u2022 T he plainti\ufb00 had legal representation, as did each of the defendants \u2013 The availability of legal \nrepresentation to both parties would have ensured that they equally had the ability to present their case. One party being unrepresented can result in signi\ufb01cant inequality.\nAccess\nThe concept of access suggests that everyone covered by the legal system and its laws should have equal access to the agencies and institutions of that system. They should be given every opportunity to understand their legal rights and pursue their legal claims in court.

The device, known as an acoustic bird deterrent (ABD), produced bird distress cries and predator calls to scare o\ufb00 unwanted birds.\nShortly after the device was installed, the neighbours began complaining about the level of noise and \nclaimed the device was a nuisance.\nThe case is a good example of how simple neighbourly disputes can escalate and require the \nintervention of the civil justice system. It also shows how the court system can help resolve disputes that the parties cannot resolve themselves.\nIn this topic we will explore each of the following aspects of Courtney & Jackson v Howell in detail, \nincluding:\n\u2022 an overview of the claim and the central facts of the/uni00A0case\u2022 dispute resolution bodies that were involved in the case\u2022 methods of dispute resolution and their appropriateness\u2022 remedies awarded and their appropriateness\u2022 possible avenues of/uni00A0appeal\u2022 the extent to which the principles of justice were achieved.\nOverview of/uni00A0the claim and central facts of/uni00A0the/uni00A0case\nThe plainti\ufb00s, Thomas Joseph Courtney (76) and Megan \nJackson (67), live on a semi-rural 5-acre property at Eagle Point near Bairnsdale, which they purchased in 1993 and had lived in since 1996. Their property is tranquil and idyllic, situated on an area which overlooks the Mitchell River and Lake King. The area is well known for its bushland and tourism.\nThe defendants, Peter Maxwell (72) and Sally Anne \nHowell, lived on a property next door to the plainti\ufb00s.

  "Page 485": "473  CHAPTER  14 RECENT CIVIL CASESIn January 2012, the defendants installed an acoustic bird \ndevice (ABD) on their property. It cost $1 990 and its pur pose \nwas to combine actual bird distress cries and predator calls \nto ward o\ufb00 pest birds. The device contained eight di\ufb00erent bird sounds, and included a control unit with four speakers which were mounted onto the defendants\u2019 machinery shed. The ABD was purchased to scare o\ufb00 swallows on the Howell\u2019s property that were defecating on the house roof and patio area. The birds were also \ufb02ying under the verandas, therefore requiring constant cleaning. They had tried many other methods before this to scare o\ufb00 the swallows, but had all failed.\nThe bird repeller could be programmed and controlled by \nthe defendants to change the number of sounds, the volume and the intervals between sounds.\nThe/uni00A0claim\nDuring 2012, the plainti\ufb00s became aware of noise coming from the defendants\u2019 property. Jackson complained to the East Gippsland Shire Council in December 2012. After the complaint, the operating times of the device were re-programmed. Further complaints were made, and in February 2013 the volume of the ABD was reduced.\nThe plainti\ufb00s issued the claim in the Magistrates\u2019 Court \nof Victoria on 5 September 2014. Their claim was a nuisance claim, as they alleged that the noise from the defendants\u2019 device constituted an interference. Nuisance involves an infringement or interference with a person\u2019s right to enjoy or use their property. Examples of interferences can include noise, vibrations, dust, smells, smoke and pollution.\nA nuisance claim involves the court balancing the rights \nof one owner to do what he or she likes on their land, with the rights of a neighbour not to have his or her use or enjoyment of the property interfered/uni00A0with. \nThe plainti\ufb00s claimed that the ABD had a signi\ufb01cant e\ufb00ect on them. Ms Jackson claimed that her \nmultiple sclerosis, which she was diagnosed with in 1993, had gotten worse as a result of the noise. She also claimed that she had become increasingly frustrated, annoyed and angry. She also argued that her social life took place away from her property and that she rarely invited people to her/uni00A0home.\nMr Courtney alleged that he was becoming increasingly angry and irritated about the issue, which \ncaused him to spend more time in his o\ufb03ce rather than his house, even though his house used to be his favourite spot on the property. \nThe plainti\ufb00s sought damages for loss of amenity and for injuries in the form of an anxiety state, \ndepression, distress, insomnia and an exacerbation of Ms Jackson\u2019s multiple sclerosis symptoms. They also sought injunctive relief (i.e an order to restrain the defendants from continuing the nuisance).\nloss of amenity \nreduction in the use or pleasure a person is entitled to have from using public or private property (e.g. through the actions of others)\ninjunction  \na remedy in the form of a court order to do something or not to do something.

The Magistrates\u2019 Court\u2019s civil jurisdiction is limited to $100 000, therefore the plainti\ufb00s, if they were awarded damages, would have received no more than this amount.\nThe Magistrates\u2019 Court is an appropriate dispute resolution body for a claim such as this. It has \nmonetary jurisdiction to hear the claim, it can be used to resolve neighbourhood disputes, and it has a court in Bairnsdale at which the hearing was/uni00A0held.\nThe Magistrates\u2019 Court ultimately found that the ABD was not a \nnuisance. Magistrate Garnett reached the conclusion after engaging in a balancing exercise between the rights of the Howells to protect their property, and the rights of the plainti\ufb00s not to have their use and enjoyment of the property unduly interfered with. He found that the defendants had made ongoing adjustments to appease the plainti\ufb00s. After considering the evidence of experts about the sounds, and attending two viewings of the property, he found that the noise emitted from the ABD was appropriate, and that he could not hear the ABD when inside the plainti\ufb00s\u2019/uni00A0house.\nMagistrate Garnett also was not satis\ufb01ed that the plainti\ufb00s had \nsu\ufb00ered the type of loss alleged. The claim was therefore dismissed. An extract of the judgment is provided below.\nSource 4 Bairnsdale Magistrates\u2019 Court heard the \ndispute over/uni00A05/uni00A0days.\nCourtney & Jackson v Howell [2016] VMC011  \n(26 July/uni00A02016)\nIn this case, Magistrate Garnett commented on the use of the/uni00A0ABD:\n[105] I found Mr Howell to be a credible and honest witness. I/uni00A0accept his evidence that he tried \nvarious methods to deter the swallows, which were unsuccessful, prior to investigating and \nresearching other alternatives and then ultimately installing the ABD, which has had its desired result. I/uni00A0do not accept the plaintiffs submission that the Howells were high handed and arrogant and had an attitude that they would \u2018protect their property at any cost\u2019. It is understandable that the Howells were prepared to go to extraordinary lengths and incur significant cost in installing the ABD as they have a beautiful property consisting of what appeared to be highly maintained gardens, manicured lawns and a truly magnificent timber house containing a glassed roof atrium. The evidence also disclosed that they modified and adjusted the operation times and settings of the ABD when they became aware of the complaints by the plaintiffs and offered to mediate prior to the issue of proceedings.EXTRACT\nVictorian Ombudsman\nThe other dispute resolution body that was involved in this case, though indirectly, was the Victorian \nOmbudsman.

  "Page 487": "475  CHAPTER  14 RECENT CIVIL CASESIn April 2013, the East Gippsland Shire Council, after visiting the properties, concluded that the ABD \nwas being operated within the proper regulations. Not satis\ufb01ed with the Council\u2019s response, Mr/uni00A0Courtney \nlodged a complaint about the Council on 5 May 2013 with the Victorian Ombudsman. The Ombudsman \nconsidered that the Council\u2019s investigation was appropriate. The plainti\ufb00s sought a review of the Ombudsman\u2019s decision, which was refused (i.e. the plainti\ufb00s were not successful).\nMethods of/uni00A0dispute resolution and their \nappropriateness\nIn April 2013, after the East Gippsland Shire Council got involved, the Council suggested that if there \nwere ongoing issues between the parties, that they should attend a formal mediation. This was after the Council concluded that the ABD was being operated within the proper regulations.\nIn January 2014, after a letter of demand was sent by the plainti\ufb00s\u2019 lawyers to the defendants alleging \nnuisance, and requesting that the nuisance cease, the defendants\u2019 lawyers responded. The defendants invited the plainti\ufb00s to participate in a mediation. That mediation never occurred. It is not clear whether mediation would have resolved this dispute, particularly as the Magistrates\u2019 Court commented on the animosity between the parties.\nIt is possible that mediation may have been appropriate in this case, despite the animosity, given the \ngreat deal of anxiety and stress likely to have been caused to the parties in having to attend a \ufb01ve-day hearing, and the signi\ufb01cant legal costs that would have been incurred. If mediation had taken place and was successful, any costs, stress and anxiety associated with the hearing would have been avoided. An extract of the case is provided below.mediation  \na method of dispute resolution, using an independent third party (the mediator) to help the disputing parties reach a resolution\nCourtney & Jackson v Howell [2016] VMC011  \n(26 July/uni00A02016)\nIn this case, Magistrate Garnett commented on the animosity between the parties:\n[104] At the outset it is worth noting that the pre-hearing procedures were hard fought, protracted \nand involved numerous applications to the court for determination. It was obvious to \nthe court prior to evidence being given that a great deal of animosity exists between the parties which resulted in them incurring significant legal costs and undoubtedly causing a great deal of anxiety and stress to them. The court heard evidence over 5/uni00A0days and at the conclusion of the hearing was presented with very detailed (and helpful) written submissions \ncomprising 87/uni00A0pages.EXTRACT\nRemedies awarded and their appropriateness\nIn this case the plainti\ufb00s sought two types of remedies:/uni00A0injunction and damages. The injunction sought \nwas a restrictive and \ufb01nal injunction;/uni00A0that is, an injunction to stop or force the defendants from using the ABD. Although the injunction would have stopped the noise going forward, the injunction would not have compensated the plainti\ufb00s for any loss they had su\ufb00ered before the injunction was granted.\nThe damages sought were for loss of amenity, distress, insomnia, anxiety and an exacerbation \n(worsening) of multiple sclerosis symptoms. If the Magistrate had accepted the claim, then the damages combined with the injunction may have put the plainti\ufb00s back to the position they were in before the wrong occurred for some types of loss, but not for others. For example, it is unlikely that a payment of money will bring back any lost sleep or any distress that the plainti\ufb00s had su\ufb00ered.damages \nthe usual remedy in a civil claim, being an amount of money the court (or tribunal) orders one party to pay to another\n14_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   475 17/10/2017   4:33 PM",

In each case, this assessment is made on the \nevidence available.\nFairness\nThe concept of fairness suggests that the law should be properly applied to all people regardless of who they are. Every person should be given an opportunity to know the case that is being put against them and to present their case. For fairness to be achieved, the civil justice system relies on fair legal processes and fair hearings.\nIn this/uni00A0case:\n\u2022 T he parties were given the opportunity to present their case \u2013 Both the plainti\ufb00s and the defendants \npresented substantial evidence to the Magistrate for him to be able to decide the case.

They  should be given every  opportunity to  \nunderstand their legal rights and pursue their legal claims in court. For  access to  be achieved, the civil \njustice system relies on defendants having good advice and legal representation. Those  who satisfy the \ntests for  assistance imposed by  Victoria Legal Aid can have  legal representation at  no charge. This is \nessential for  parties attempting to  navigate through complex legal processes.\nIn a civil trial, there are  strict processes for  the sharing of evidence between the parties, especially the \nkey documents that will be used as evidence to  the trial. This helps legal counsel on both sides prepare \nfor/uni00A0trial.\nIn this/uni00A0case:\n\u2022 It is likely that the use  of mediation would have  increased access to  justice, as it provided the parties \nwith an alternative method of resolving the dispute outside trial.

The search focused on various parts of  the world, and at times \nauthorities shifted their focus to different locations based on information they had received.\nOn 29 July 2015, debris was found on the coast of  Reunion Island \nin the western Indian Ocean. A week after its discovery, the Malaysian Prime Minister announced that the debris was from \ufb02ight MH370.\nOn 22 July 2016, New York magazine reported that the pilot was \nbelieved to have \ufb02own a suicide route on his home \ufb02ight simulator, and that it closely matched the \ufb01nal \ufb02ight of  MH370. It suggested that Malaysian authorities \u2018suppressed at least one key piece of  incriminating information\u2019. They claimed that this was not surprising, since national safety boards have a tendency to \u2018refuse to believe that their pilots could have intentionally crashed an aircraft full of  passengers\u2019.

The search focused on various parts of  the world, and at times \nauthorities shifted their focus to different locations based on information they had received.\nOn 29 July 2015, debris was found on the coast of  Reunion Island \nin the western Indian Ocean. A week after its discovery, the Malaysian Prime Minister announced that the debris was from \ufb02ight MH370.\nOn 22 July 2016, New York magazine reported that the pilot was \nbelieved to have \ufb02own a suicide route on his home \ufb02ight simulator, and that it closely matched the \ufb01nal \ufb02ight of  MH370. It suggested that Malaysian authorities \u2018suppressed at least one key piece of  incriminating information\u2019.

The availability of  legal representation to both parties will ensure that they equally \nhave the ability to present their case. One party being unrepresented may result in signi\ufb01cant inequality.\nAccess\nThe concept of  access suggests that everyone covered by the legal system and its laws should have equal access to the agencies and institutions of  that system. They should be given every opportunity to understand their legal rights and pursue their legal claims in court. For access to be achieved, the civil justice system relies on defendants having good advice and legal representation. Those who satisfy the tests for assistance imposed by Victoria Legal Aid can have legal representation at no charge. This is essential for parties attempting to navigate through complex legal processes.\nIn a civil trial, there are strict processes for the sharing of  evidence between the parties, especially the key \ndocuments that will be used as evidence to the trial. This helps legal counsel on both sides prepare for trial.\nIn this case:\n\u2022 It is likely that the use of  mediation will increase access to justice, as it provides the parties with an alternative method of  resolving the dispute outside trial.\n\u2022 Costs may be a factor in determining whether access to justice can be achieved. While there is no suggestion that either party cannot afford to pay the costs, both parties are likely to be out of  pocket for their costs regardless of  whether they are successful.If  the Court of  Appeal hears and determines the appeal, and either party wishes to appeal that \ndecision, then a special leave application would need to be made in the High Court of  Australia. If  the High Court grants special leave, then it will hear and determine the appeal.\nThere are no other avenues of  appeal after the High Court.\nThe extent to which the principles of justice were \nachieved\nAn assessment of  the extent to which the principles of  justice \u2013 i.e. fairness, equality and access \u2013 were \nachieved in the case of  MH370 is provided below. At the time of  publication, it was not known whether \nthe claim had been heard and determined by the Supreme Court. As such, this assessment is made on the evidence available.\nFairness\nThe concept of  fairness suggests that the law should be properly applied to all people regardless of  who they are. Every person should be given an opportunity to know the case that is being put against them and to present their case. For fairness to be achieved, the civil justice system relies on fair legal processes and fair hearings. In this case, fairness may be upheld if:\n\u2022 The directions and orders given by the Supreme Court allow each party an opportunity to present \ntheir case, and rebut the other side\u2019s case. For example if  Mrs Chong has evidence that establishes \nthe extent of  her loss, then Malaysia Airlines should have the opportunity to see that evidence. This is likely to be effected by the Court making orders for the exchange of  documents and evidence.\n\u2022 The Court properly applies the laws of evidence. The Supreme Court will need to rule on \nthe admissibility of  evidence, and will need to apply the relevant legislation and the authorities to determine whether evidence is admissible or not.\n\u2022 The rules of procedure allow the parties to present their case. There are general rules of  procedure \nabout which party presents their case \ufb01rst at trial, though the Court does have the power to decide on the rules in each particular case.\n\u2022 The evidence is properly considered and taken into account when determining liability.\n\u2022 T he laws relating to negligence and the awarding of  damages are taken into account when determining \nthe outcome.\n\u2022 T here is a timely resolution of the case, having regard to the complexity and size of  the dispute. \nThe claim was issued in February 2016, and though there is no particular deadline by which the \ndispute should be resolved, to ensure fairness in the process, there should not be unreasonable delays.\nEquality\nThe concept of  equality suggests that all people should be equal before the law regardless of  who they are. For equality to be achieved, every person in society who is involved in a civil claim should have the same opportunity to present their case without advantage or disadvantage. If  the trial proceeds by judge alone, then one of  the critical features of  ensuring that equality is upheld is if  the judge acts impartially and without bias, and makes a decision based on the facts as opposed to any preconceived or unconscious bias. The judge will also be supported by court personnel whose duty it is to ensure that they act independent of  the parties.fairness \none of the principles of justice; fairness means having fair processes and a fair hearing (e.g. the parties in a legal case should have an opportunity to know the facts of the case and have the opportunity to present their side of events; and the pre-hearing and hearing (or trial) processes should be fair and impartial)\nequality \none of the principles of justice; equality means people should be equal before the law and have the same opportunity to present their case as anyone else, without advantage or disadvantage\naccess \none of the principles of justice; access means that all people should be able to understand their legal rights and pursue their case\ndirections \nan instruction given by the court to one or more parties to do a certain thing\norders \nformal directions given by a court to do or not do somethingCHECK YOUR LEARNING 14.5 \nDe\ufb01ne and explain\n1 Brie\ufb02y describe what happened to \ufb02ight MH370.\n2 Y en Li Chong has issued a claim in relation to the \ndisappearance of  \ufb02ight MH370.\na Identify the plaintiff  and the defendant in this \ndispute.\nb What is the claim that the plaintiff  is making?\nc Which dispute resolution body is being used to resolve the dispute?\nd Identify and describe one possible dispute resolution method that is likely to be used.\ne Describe the remedy that the plaintiff  is seeking.\nSynthesise and/uni00A0apply\n3 On your own or in pairs, conduct some additional \nresearch and identify at least two other civil disputes \nthat have arisen out of  the disappearance of  \ufb02ight MH370.

While there is no suggestion that either party cannot afford to pay the costs, both parties are likely to be out of  pocket for their costs regardless of  whether they are successful.If  the Court of  Appeal hears and determines the appeal, and either party wishes to appeal that \ndecision, then a special leave application would need to be made in the High Court of  Australia. If  the High Court grants special leave, then it will hear and determine the appeal.\nThere are no other avenues of  appeal after the High Court.\nThe extent to which the principles of justice were \nachieved\nAn assessment of  the extent to which the principles of  justice \u2013 i.e. fairness, equality and access \u2013 were \nachieved in the case of  MH370 is provided below. At the time of  publication, it was not known whether \nthe claim had been heard and determined by the Supreme Court. As such, this assessment is made on the evidence available.\nFairness\nThe concept of  fairness suggests that the law should be properly applied to all people regardless of  who they are. Every person should be given an opportunity to know the case that is being put against them and to present their case. For fairness to be achieved, the civil justice system relies on fair legal processes and fair hearings. In this case, fairness may be upheld if:\n\u2022 The directions and orders given by the Supreme Court allow each party an opportunity to present \ntheir case, and rebut the other side\u2019s case. For example if  Mrs Chong has evidence that establishes \nthe extent of  her loss, then Malaysia Airlines should have the opportunity to see that evidence. This is likely to be effected by the Court making orders for the exchange of  documents and evidence.\n\u2022 The Court properly applies the laws of evidence. The Supreme Court will need to rule on \nthe admissibility of  evidence, and will need to apply the relevant legislation and the authorities to determine whether evidence is admissible or not.\n\u2022 The rules of procedure allow the parties to present their case. There are general rules of  procedure \nabout which party presents their case \ufb01rst at trial, though the Court does have the power to decide on the rules in each particular case.\n\u2022 The evidence is properly considered and taken into account when determining liability.\n\u2022 T he laws relating to negligence and the awarding of  damages are taken into account when determining \nthe outcome.\n\u2022 T here is a timely resolution of the case, having regard to the complexity and size of  the dispute. \nThe claim was issued in February 2016, and though there is no particular deadline by which the \ndispute should be resolved, to ensure fairness in the process, there should not be unreasonable delays.\nEquality\nThe concept of  equality suggests that all people should be equal before the law regardless of  who they are. For equality to be achieved, every person in society who is involved in a civil claim should have the same opportunity to present their case without advantage or disadvantage. If  the trial proceeds by judge alone, then one of  the critical features of  ensuring that equality is upheld is if  the judge acts impartially and without bias, and makes a decision based on the facts as opposed to any preconceived or unconscious bias. The judge will also be supported by court personnel whose duty it is to ensure that they act independent of  the parties.fairness \none of the principles of justice; fairness means having fair processes and a fair hearing (e.g. the parties in a legal case should have an opportunity to know the facts of the case and have the opportunity to present their side of events; and the pre-hearing and hearing (or trial) processes should be fair and impartial)\nequality \none of the principles of justice; equality means people should be equal before the law and have the same opportunity to present their case as anyone else, without advantage or disadvantage\naccess \none of the principles of justice; access means that all people should be able to understand their legal rights and pursue their case\ndirections \nan instruction given by the court to one or more parties to do a certain thing\norders \nformal directions given by a court to do or not do somethingCHECK YOUR LEARNING 14.5 \nDe\ufb01ne and explain\n1 Brie\ufb02y describe what happened to \ufb02ight MH370.\n2 Y en Li Chong has issued a claim in relation to the \ndisappearance of  \ufb02ight MH370.\na Identify the plaintiff  and the defendant in this \ndispute.\nb What is the claim that the plaintiff  is making?\nc Which dispute resolution body is being used to resolve the dispute?\nd Identify and describe one possible dispute resolution method that is likely to be used.\ne Describe the remedy that the plaintiff  is seeking.\nSynthesise and/uni00A0apply\n3 On your own or in pairs, conduct some additional \nresearch and identify at least two other civil disputes \nthat have arisen out of  the disappearance of  \ufb02ight MH370.

Although people\u2019s understanding of rights can vary, most de\ufb01nitions include some common themes such as the promotion of respect, dignity, equality and justice. They also include reference to the protection of basic freedoms. In democratic societies, these basic freedoms include things like:\n\u2022 the right to life\u2022 the right to access clean water, food and shelter\u2022 freedom from slavery, cruel punishment and discrimination\u2022 freedom of speech and religion\u2022 the right to a fair and unbiased legal system\u2022 the right to vote.\nSource 1 On 10 December 2016 a group of \ndemonstrators gathered in Sydney to mark \nInternational Human Rights Day and raise awareness about human rights abuses suffered by Indigenous Australians.\ndiscrimination  the unfavourable treatment of a person based on a certain attribute (e.g. age, gender, disability, ethnicity, religion or sexuality).

  "Page 505": "485  CHAPTER/uni00A015  RIGHT SOne problem associated with rights being protected by Acts \nof Parliament is that these rights are not permanently guaranteed. \nThat is, as the supreme law-making body, parliament can always pass legislation to change or abrogate  (cancel) an existing \nright that is protected by statute/uni00A0law.\nInternational treaties and \nconventions\nIn addition to Commonwealth, state and territory parliaments passing legislation, many basic human \nrights are also protected by treaties. The Commonwealth Government gives its commitment to uphold a range of international human rights treaties and conventions by becoming a signatory (committing to them). The Australian Government signs the treaty to demonstrate its intent to adopt the treaty and incorporate it into our law. However, being a signatory to an international treaty or convention is not enough to make its rights and standards part of the signatory nation\u2019s law. For that to happen, the signatory nation must speci\ufb01cally pass legislation to approve and adopt the various rights outlined in the international treaty or convention. This is called rati\ufb01cation of the treaty. When it rati\ufb01es a treaty, the nation is legally bound to accept and implement the rights.\nOver the years, the Commonwealth Parliament has passed various Acts of Parliament to \nincorporate the rights and principles included in international treaties and conventions into Australian law. For example, in 1975, Australia adopted and rati\ufb01ed the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (1965), which aimed to abolish any laws that discriminated against \npeople on the basis of their race, colour, descent or ethnicity and introduce laws and policies that promote racial tolerance and understanding. This was achieved by the Commonwealth Parliament passing the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) to give e\ufb00ect to Australia's obligations under that convention. The Racial Discrimination Act was important because it was the \ufb01rst Commonwealth statute to promote equality before the law for all persons, irrespective of their race, colour or national or ethnic origin, and make unlawful the discrimination of people on the basis of their race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin.\nThe in\ufb02uence of international declarations and treaties on Australia\u2019s protection of rights will be \nexamined in more detail later in this chapter.\nThe Victorian Charter of/uni00A0Human Rights and \nResponsibilities\nWhile Australia does not have a national charter or bill of rights, the Victorian and Australian \nCapital Territory parliaments have both passed Acts of Parliament that aim to promote and protect \nthe basic rights of the people of each state and territory.\nThe Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act, referred to as the Human Rights Charter (or \nsimply the Charter), sets out the basic rights, freedoms and responsibilities of the Victorian people. It requires bodies such as the Victorian Parliament, state and local government departments and organisations (including the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Education and Training, VicRoads, Victoria Police and local councils) and people delivering government services to act in a manner that complies with and upholds the basic human rights in the Charter.supreme law-making \nbody the body (e.g. the parliament in the Westminster system) responsible for changing existing law and creating new law\nabrogate  \nto cancel or abolish \na court-made law by passing an Act of Parliament\nsignatory \na state or organisation that has signed an international treaty to demonstrate a nation\u2019s intent to adopt the treaty and incorporate it into their law\nrati\ufb01cation \nconfirmation by a nation\u2019s parliament of its approval of an international treaty signed by its government.

Many common law  cases have  recognised \nthe right of an accused to  have  access to  legal representation (a lawyer) for  a criminal trial. Indeed, in \nsome instances, the judges have  adjourned (i.e. paused) trials to  give  an accused time to  access that \nlegal representation. The  right of an accused to  legal representation was  recognised by  the High Court \nin the case of Dietrich v The/uni00A0Queen (1992) 177 CLR 292, discussed below.Many rights are  protected in Australia by  common law; that is,  law that has have  been established by  the \nstate  and federal courts through precedent.\nJudges can play a signi\ufb01cant role in protecting rights when resolving disputes in which there has \nbeen an alleged breach of human rights, and by  interpreting the meaning of Commonwealth and \nstate  legislation that protects human rights. When giving their decisions in human rights disputes (or \npossibly other kinds of dispute), judges may  establish a legal principle (referred to  as a precedent) that \nprotects the rights of the Australian people. Legal rights that are  established in this way  are referred to  \nas common law  rights. Common law  refers to  legal principles or laws  established by  judges in the higher \ncourts.

It was  also alleged that some children suffered \nbruising from an overuse of force  by security officers. In contrast, the Victorian Government \nclaimed it had no option other than housing some young offenders in a  specific section of \nBarwon Prison, completely separate from the adult section of  the prison, after a  series of  riots, \ntaking place over  18/uni00A0months, had left sections of  the Parkville Youth Justice Precinct damaged, \nand because all other youth facilities were/uni00A0full. \nIn his judgment, Supreme Court Justice Garde ruled that the decision to  transfer young \noffenders to  Barwon Prison for  \u2018emergency accommodation\u2019 did not take  into account various \nrights of  children as  outlined in  the Children, Youth and Families Act 2005/uni00A0(Vic) and the Charter of  \nHuman Rights and Responsibilities Act, and as such was  unlawful.

In its  ruling, the High Court upheld the \nprinciples outlined in  the International Covenant on  Civil and Political Rights (1966) and established \na common law right (through its  judgment) that an individual who is charged with a  serious \noffence has a  right to  legal representation. The High Court also ruled a  trial judge can  delay a  \ntrial until a person charged with a serious offence has legal representation.\nInterestingly, in 2009, over  25/uni00A0years after he was  first  charged with importing illegal drugs, \nDietrich (who was  by this time aged 52/uni00A0years and had changed his name to  Hugo Rich) was  \nsentenced to  life imprisonment, with a  minimum non-parole period of  30/uni00A0years, after being found \nguilty of murdering a  security guard during an armed robbery at Blackburn North Shopping \nCentre in Melbourne\u2019s eastern suburbs (in R v Rich [2009] VSC 515 (13 November/uni00A02009)).\nRecognition of/uni00A0Charter/uni00A0rights\nThe courts have  also recognised the various rights that are  available to  people under the Charter.

It outlines how Australia is to be governed. In addition to creating and outlining the structure and law-making powers of the Commonwealth Parliament, the Constitution also establishes some basic rights for Australian citizens. However, the Constitution does not contain a bill of rights; that is, a comprehensive list of the basic rights of the Australian people.\nThe Constitution protects the rights of the Australian people in three main ways, being through:\n\u2022 express/uni00A0rights\n\u2022 implied rights (i.e. indirectly protected through the text or structure of the Constitution).\n\u2022 rights in the Constitution\u2019s structure.\nExpress/uni00A0rights\nThe Australian Constitution protects \ufb01ve express rights of the Australian people. An express right is explicitly stated (or entrenched) in the wording of the Constitution. It can only be removed or altered by changing the wording of the Constitution. In Australia, the Constitution can only be changed through a successful referendum or public vote. This di\ufb00ers from rights that exist in common law or in statute, which can be abolished or altered at any time by parliament passing a law to override/uni00A0them.\nThe \ufb01ve express rights protected in the Australian Constitution are the right/uni00A0to:\n\u2022 free interstate trade and commerce (Section 92)/uni00A0\u2013 this right prevents parliament from treating \ninterstate trade di\ufb00erently between states.

It does not apply to  the \nstates (or territories).\nOver the years, when resolving disputes in which individuals or organisations have  alleged that \nCommonwealth law  breaches the express right to  freedom of religion, the High Court has interpreted the \nmeaning of \u2018religion\u2019 in di\ufb00erent ways.  For example, in the case of  Adelaide Company of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses \nInc. v Commonwealth (1943) 67 CLR 116, the High Court broadly interpreted the meaning of Section 116 \n15_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   493 17/10/2017   4:53 PM",

By contrast, in other cases the High Court has interpreted other parts of Section 116 narrowly. This occurred in Attorney-General (Vic); Ex Rel Black v Commonwealth (1981) 146 CLR 559 when the High Court ruled the Commonwealth Government has the ability to provide funding to religious schools.\nThe DOGS/uni00A0case\nAttorney-General (Vic); Ex Rel Black v Commonwealth (1981) 146 CLR/uni00A0559\nIn this case, known as the Defence of Government Schools (DOGS) Case, the plaintiffs claimed \nlegislation passed by the Commonwealth Parliament, which allowed for the Commonwealth Government to give financial assistance to non-government schools in states and territories, was invalid. The plaintiffs claimed that giving money to schools was in breach of Section 116 of the Constitution, which bans the Commonwealth from establishing any religion or for imposing any religious observance.\nIn its decision the High Court reinforced the right to freedom of religion and confirmed \nthat the Commonwealth cannot establish a religion. However, the High Court ruled that the legislation was valid and that allowing the Commonwealth to give grants (money) to the states to be used to provide financial assistance to non-government schools did not breach the right to freedom of religion as stated in Section 116. More precisely, the High Court ruled there was no religious inequality, because the grants did not differentiate between different schools based on religion. The decision therefore allowed the Commonwealth to give financial assistance to non-government schools, which included assisting religions by continuing to fund religious schools.LEGAL \nCASE\nChaplaincy in government schools program\nWilliams v Commonwealth (2012) 248 CLR/uni00A0156\nIn this case, Ronald Williams challenged the Commonwealth Government\u2019s power to fund a school chaplain program that was running in his children\u2019s government primary school in Queensland. The Commonwealth Government had entered into a funding agreement with Scripture Union Queensland to provide chaplaincy services, such as \u2018general religious and personal advice to those seeking it, [and] comfort and support to students and staff, such as during times of grief\u2019. The chaplain was not to seek to \u2018impose any religious beliefs or persuade an individual toward a particular set of religious beliefs\u2019.\nWilliams argued that the funding agreement was invalid on various grounds, including \nbecause it breached Section 116 of the Constitution, which states that \u2018no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth\u2019. Williams argued that the school chaplain is an \u2018office \u2026 under the Commonwealth\u2019 and, further, that there is a religious test to hold such an office.\nThe High Court unanimously dismissed the challenge under Section 116 relating to a \n\u2018religious test\u2019, because the chaplains were not employees of the Commonwealth. The High Court did, however, rule the legislation to be invalid on other grounds and so the plaintiff succeeded in the case.

When resolving \na dispute over  whether or not the Constitution protects a particular right, the High Court Justices can \ndecide that a word  or phrase within the Constitution implies that a right exists even  though it might \nnot be explicitly stated. For  example, although the Constitution does not explicitly state  that Australians \nhave  the right to  freely discuss and debate political issues \u2013 referred to  as the freedom of political \ncommunication \u2013 in various cases throughout the years, the High Court has decided that this freedom is implied in the Constitution. The  \ufb01rst case to  recognise the implied freedom of  political communication \nwas Australian Capital Television v Commonwealth (1992) 177 CLR 106.freedom of political \ncommunication  the right of the Australian people to  \nfreely discuss and debate political issues, subject to  certain \nrestrictions\nHigh Court implies the freedom of political \ncommunication\nAustralian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth (1992) 177 CLR/uni00A0106\nIn this case, the High Court was  required to  determine whether the Commonwealth Parliament\u2019s \nPolitical Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act 1991 (Cth), which basically banned individuals \nand organisations from making political broadcasts and placing advertising on radio and television during election campaigns, was unfair and in breach of the Australian Constitution.\nIn simple terms, the justices of the High Court ruled that while our Constitution does not \nexpressly mention or protect the broad right to  freedom of speech, it does recognise that the \nAustralian parliamentary system  is based on  the principle of  representative  government , which \nrequires freedom of  political communication. In  accordance with the principle of  representative \ngovernment, the parliament must make laws that reflect the views and values of the people. This means that Australians should be able to  advertise and discuss their views, policies and \nopinions in a  public forum (such as on  television or  radio) prior to an  election so  that voters  can \nmake an informed decision electing the government.LEGAL  \nCASE\nrepresentative  \ngovernment   \na political system  \nin which the people \nelect members of parliament to  \nrepresent them in government\n15_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   495 17/10/2017   4:53 PM",
  "Page 516": "496  UNIT  2 SANCTIONS, REMEDIES AND RIGHTSOnce a right is implied by the High Court, it may be made clearer or con\ufb01rmed in later cases. For \nexample, the freedom of political communication implied in the Australian Capital Television case was \nconsidered again in two High Court cases:/uni00A0 Theophanous v Herald and Weekly Times Limited (1994) 182 \nCLR 104 and Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1997) 189 CLR 520. These cases con\ufb01rmed the existence of the right to political communication. The Theophanous case extended the implied right to allow comments about members of parliament and their suitability for o\ufb03ce. The Lange  case went \nfurther, stating that the right to freedom of political communication exists at all times, not just prior to an election. This right is not a general right to free speech, but only a right to free communication on matters relating to political issues.\nAbsolute freedom of/uni00A0political communication\nThe High Court has ruled in various cases that Australians have the right to freedom of political communication. But should this right be unlimited?\nWhile we have a right to freely discuss and debate political issues, some people think that we should \nnot have the right to make cruel or o\ufb00ensive public comments on political issues such as same-sex marriage, adoption, abortion, or euthanasia. In other words, they believe the right to freedom of political communication should be restricted.\nOther people believe the right to free political speech should never be restricted. They generally argue \nthat free speech has a higher value than people\u2019s hurt feelings.\nIn various cases, however, the High Court has found that the implied freedom of political communication \ncan be restricted when it is reasonable to do so (for example, if it o\ufb00ends against a person\u2019s privacy, or if the communication ruins a person\u2019s reputation).\nRights in/uni00A0the Constitution\u2019s \nstructure\nThe Australian Constitution outlines various \nparliamentary principles and concepts which form the basis of our parliamentary system. These systems and concepts which are included within the text and structure of the Constitution also indirectly protect some rights of the Australian people. For example, the Constitution indirectly protects the right of the people to elect the Commonwealth Parliament by speci\ufb01cally stating that Australia\u2019s parliamentary system must be based on the principle of representative government. This means the parliament must be elected by the people to make law on their behalf.\nMore precisely, Sections 7 and 24 of the Constitution \nstate that individuals elected to the Senate (the upper house) and the House of Representatives (the lower house) must be directly chosen by the people, guaranteeing the right of the people to elect the Commonwealth Parliament. Sections 8 and 30 also support the principle of representative government by requiring that each elector is only allowed to vote/uni00A0once.\nSource 4 Australia was one of the first \ncountries in the world to give women the right to vote in federal elections.In 1902, the newly created Commonwealth Parliament passed legislation called the Commonwealth Franchise Act/uni00A01902 (Cth) to make Australia one of the first countries in the world to give women the right to vote in Commonwealth (federal) elections.

  "Page 517": "497  CHAPTER/uni00A015  RIGHT SInterestingly, however, the Constitution does not speci\ufb01cally guarantee the right of people aged 18 or \nover the right to vote. These rights were guaranteed by the Commonwealth Parliament passing separate \nActs of Parliament. For example, in 1973 the minimum voting age was lowered from 21/uni00A0years to 18/uni00A0years \nin 1973 by the Commonwealth Parliament passing an amendment (change) to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918/uni00A0(Cth).\nThe following legal case explores how the High Court has considered the right to vote.\nPrisoners\u2019 right to/uni00A0vote\nRoach v Electoral Commissioner (2007) 233 CLR/uni00A0162\nIn 2006, the Commonwealth Parliament passed the Electoral and Referendum Amendment \n(Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Act 2006 (Cth), which amended the Commonwealth \nElectoral Act to ban all prisoners from voting in Commonwealth elections. Before this Act was \npassed, only prisoners who were serving sentences longer than three years were banned from voting, but this new Act changed the law so that all sentenced prisoners were unable to vote (affecting approximately 20 000 prisoners).\nAfter the Act was introduced, a prisoner who was serving a six-year sentence, Vickie Lee \nRoach, mounted a High Court challenge claiming that Commonwealth legislation that banned prisoners from voting breached the right of the people to vote, as protected in the Australian Constitution.\nIn simple terms, the High Court ruled that the Commonwealth\u2019s 2006 changes to the \nCommonwealth Electoral Act breached Sections 7 and 24 of the Australian Constitution, which \nrequires that parliament be chosen \u2018directly by the people\u2019 and legally protected the right to vote. As such the 2006 Act was declared invalid. The High Court found that the Parliament should only be able to restrict a person\u2019s right to vote in cases where the offender has committed very serious misconduct (e.g. for prisoners serving a prison sentence of more than three years). The Commonwealth Parliament was not able to override the decision and precedent set by the High/uni00A0Court.LEGAL \nCASE\nThe Constitution also indirectly protects the rights of the Australian people by ensuring our \nparliamentary system is based on the principle of separation of powers, which helps reduce the possibility of the Commonwealth Parliament misusing their power. In simple terms, the separation of powers refers to the requirement that no one body (that is, the parliament, the government or the courts) can hold all of the main types of power within our parliamentary system. This means neither the parliament, the government or the courts can perform all three tasks of making the law, administering the law and applying and interpreting the/uni00A0law.\nFor example, while the Commonwealth Parliament holds the power to make the law, it does not have \nthe power to resolve disputes over the meaning or application of its laws because this power, referred \nto as the judicial power, is only held by the courts and tribunals. \nIn fact, the High Court is the only court with the power to resolve disputes concerning allegations \nthat the Commonwealth Parliament has made a law beyond its constitutional power or in breach of the constitutionally protected rights of the people, and declare the Commonwealth\u2019s law invalid. In this way the High Court, or independent judiciary, can act as a checking system to ensure the Commonwealth Parliament makes law within its power and upholds the rights of the Australian people that are protected by the Constitution.separation of powers  \na principle established by the Australian Constitution that ensures the three powers of our parliamentary system (i.e. executive power, legislative power and judicial power) remain separate.

As part of this global cooperation, Australia has signed a number of international treaties and declarations, many of which aim to protect the rights of citizens around the world. Many of these treaties and declarations have in\ufb02uenced the way in which Australia protects the rights of its own citizens.\nAn international treaty (or convention) is an agreement between countries (or other organisations such \nas the World Bank) to be bound by international law. When a nation signs a treaty, it demonstrates its intention to adopt the treaty and incorporate its requirements and conditions into its nation\u2019s law. However, the requirements and conditions of a treaty do not become a part of a nation\u2019s law until the treaty has been rati\ufb01ed. This means the parliaments must pass speci\ufb01c legislation to give e\ufb00ect to the obligations of the treaty and make them a legally binding part of the nation\u2019s/uni00A0law.\nA declaration is a document that outlines a set of standards that nations (or other organisations such \nas the World Bank) voluntarily agree to but are not legally bound to uphold or implement. It sets out certain \u2018aspirations\u2019 or \u2018intentions\u2019 of the parties to the agreement. Countries can include those aspirations or intentions in their own law. A/uni00A0declaration can ultimately lead to a treaty being made on the/uni00A0topic.\nInternational declarations\nOver the years Australia has signed and rati\ufb01ed a number of major international declarations that protect human rights. In doing so, it has given its commitment to uphold the rights and basic principles contained in these declarations and treaties.\nUniversal Declaration of/uni00A0Human/uni00A0Rights\nIn December 1948, after the end of World War II, the United Nations established the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). The UDHR states that \u2018Human rights are rights inherent to all human beings, You can use acronyms \nin your responses to Legal Studies questions, but make sure you first define the acronym, as many are not universally known.

The Declaration provides Indigenous peoples with various rights, including the right to be free and equal to all other peoples and individuals, the right to all human rights and freedoms recognised in the UDHR, the right to a nationality and the right to/uni00A0life\n\u2022 the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity, adopted by the General Counsel of the United Nations \nEducational, Scienti\ufb01c and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) in 2001. It recognises that cultural rights are integral to human rights, that people should be able to express themselves in the language of their choice, and should be entitled to rights irrespective of their cultural identity.\nInternational treaties\nIn addition to the basic human rights established by the UDHR, there are also many other international treaties that aim to protect a range of more speci\ufb01c rights. Australia is a signatory to a number of those treaties.\nInternational Covenant on/uni00A0Civil and Political/uni00A0Rights\nThe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) was signed in December 1966, and came \ninto force in March 1976 (though Australia didn\u2019t become a signatory until 1980). It aims to commit parties to protect the civil and political rights of individuals.\nThe ICCPR aims to guarantee many of the broad rights established by the UDHR, such as the right \nto life, freedom from torture and slavery, a fair legal system, freedom of speech, religion and privacy, and the right to vote. The rights protected by the Human Rights Charter are based on the rights contained in the/uni00A0ICCPR.\n15_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   501 17/10/2017   4:53 PM",

  "Page 523": "503  CHAPTER/uni00A015  RIGHT SOptional protocols\nAustralia has also signed and adopted a number of optional protocols to these treaties. Optional \nprotocols can be created after the formation of a major treaty to address additional matters or specify \nprocedures to help achieve the aims of the main treaty. Optional protocols are treaties in their own right and nations who support the main treaty can decide to also adopt and ratify any optional protocols. For example, after the ICCPR was established by the United Nations, in 1989 the United Nations established \nthe Second Optional Protocol to the ICCPR, Aiming at the Abolition of the Death Penalty (which was adopted \nby Australia in/uni00A01990).\nOther examples of optional protocols that Australia has adopted include the:\n\u2022 Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (2000) (CEDAW) \u2013 which gives people and groups of women the right to complain \nto the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women about violations of rights that are protected under the main CEDAW/uni00A0treaty\n\u2022 Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Con\ufb02ict (2000) \u2013 which expands the rights of children protected in the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) by o\ufb00ering speci\ufb01c protection to children regarding their recruitment to armed services and use in hostilities and war. For example, nations that adopt the optional protocol commit to not recruiting or enlisting children under the age of 18/uni00A0years to \ufb01ght on a battle\ufb01eld or conscripting children aged under 18 to the armed services\n\u2022 Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography (2000) \u2013 which expands the main CRC treaty by requiring nations that adopt the optional protocol to undertake measures to guarantee the protection of children from being sold and exploited through child prostitution and child pornography. The optional protocol was introduced in response to concern over the increase of and widespread tra\ufb03cking of children.\nEnforcement of/uni00A0international conventions  \nand treaties\nThere is no global court or international legal system to monitor and impose sanctions or penalties on \nnations that might infringe an international treaty or convention. However, various bodies aim to enforce them. For example, the United Nations has established the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to resolve legal disputes between nations that are members of the United Nations. There are, however, limitations in taking a case to the ICJ to be resolved. They include a requirement that the nations involved must agree to accept the authority of the ICJ. This means nations cannot be compelled to attend the/uni00A0ICJ.\nThe United Nations O\ufb03ce of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) educates and \nassists member nations to uphold their commitments under various human rights treaties. In 2006, the OHCHR set up a system called the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) to review the human rights records of all 192 United Nations member states and highlight areas where breaches have occurred.\nLikewise, many of the main international human rights treaties include terms that establish committees \nto monitor treaties to encourage nations that may be acting in breach of a treaty to implement changes and comply with it. For example, the United Nations Human Rights Committee was established to hear disputes under the ICCPR. Similarly, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women \nwas set up to hear and deal with complaints against violations of rights protected by/uni00A0CEDAW.optional protocols  \nadditional treaties in their own right that can be adopted and ratified by nations who are a party to the main treaty\nSource 3 Australians against the death penalty demonstrated prior to the execution of two Australians, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, in Indonesia in/uni00A02015.\nIn 2014, a report from the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimated that 21/uni00A0million people were victims of human trafficking each year.

The ratification will encourage continuous improvement of inspection and conditions of detention.\nOPCAT is an  international treaty that will improve the way  Australia's prisons and detention \ncentres are managed and monitored.\nThe Commonwealth Attorney-General, George Brandis, announced that OPCAT would be \nratified by the end of/uni00A02017.\nUnder the new  arrangements, independent inspection agencies will monitor Australia's \nprisons and immigration detention centres. The Commonwealth will consult the states  and \nterritories about the most appropriate bodies to  undertake the monitoring. Existing human \nrights organisations could be appointed.\nThe intention is to  \u2018assist states to  better protect people in detention from torture and \nmistreatment\u2019 not to  shame them. This \u2018is not to  engage in an act of moral vanity, it is to  \ncooperate in a  mutual endeavour to  bring about a  tangible improvement to  the treatment of \npeople in detention\u2019, Senator Brandis/uni00A0said.\nThe Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman would coordinate the inspecting bodies.\nThe Human Rights Commissioner, Ed Santow, praised the commitment to  ratify, saying it \nwas good for Australian human rights.CASE \nSTUDY\nAlthough legislation must be passed to  ratify and give  e\ufb00ect to  rights and obligations of an \ninternational treaty, sometimes our Commonwealth and state  parliaments already have  legislation in \nplace that protects many of  the rights contained in the document. For  example, the Convention on the \nRights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) was  adopted by  the United Nations and became available \nfor nations to  sign in 2006. Ye t  the Commonwealth Parliament had already passed the Disability \nDiscrimination Act  1992 (Cth), which protected many of the rights contained in the CRPD. In recent \nyears, the passing of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act  2013 (Cth) has also reinforced many \nof the rights and obligations included in the CRPD by  improving the support o\ufb00ered to  people with a \ndisability and their families and carers.\nIn Australia, the Commonwealth, state  and territory governments have  also committed to  providing \na range of organisations and systems to  enforce human rights legislation and resolve alleged breaches \nof human rights. For  example, when an alleged human right has been breached the a\ufb00ected individual \nmay seek to  have  their rights enforced through the Australian court system or through various other \norganisations. This includes the Australian Human Rights Commission (which can investigate and \nresolve complaints under various Commonwealth legislation such as the Age Discrimination Act  2004 \n(Cth)) and the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission.\nAn example of a legal case involving the National Disability Insurance Agency is detailed on the \nnext page.In 2017 the Australian Government gave  a commitment to  ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention \nagainst Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OPCAT).\nThis is further explored in the case study below.\n15_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   506 17/10/2017   4:53 PM",

The NDIS aims to provide support to people with a permanent or significant disability. This is so that they are able to participate in the community and the workplace, and access a range of services including health, education, housing, legal and community services, so they may \u2018live an ordinary/uni00A0life\u2019.\nOne of the aims of the NDIS was to enable the Government to contribute to some of \nthe transport costs for people with disability and their family and carers. As such the NDIS Act stated that the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA), the independent statutory authority responsible for implementing the NDIS, was only required to fund reasonable \nand necessary supports taking into account \u2018what is reasonable to expect families, carers, \ninformal networks and the community to provide.\u2019\nIn 2017, however, this part (provision) of the NDIS Act was challenged in the Federal Court by \nLiam McGarrigle, a young man aged 21/uni00A0years who qualified for the NDIS due to an intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. McGarrigle, who was represented by Victoria Legal Aid, challenged the NDIA\u2019s ability to only make partial payments for transport costs. He also challenged the meaning of what is a \u2018reasonable\u2019 amount of money to expect people with a disability and their families, carers and support groups to contribute to the funding of \u2018necessary supports\u2019 after the NDIA would only pay 75 per cent of the total transport costs ($16 000)/uni00A0he incurred in getting to and from work and support programs. This left McGarrigle to pay the balance, which placed great financial strain on him and his family. Living in a small country town 25 kilometres from Geelong, McGarrigle was unable to drive or access public transport.\nMcGarrigle was successful in the proceeding after the judge ruled that, provided all \nnecessary criteria are met, people who live in rural areas and are unable to drive or use public transport should have the full cost of their transport needs (e.g. taxi fares) paid by the NDIA, and not just receive partial funding.\nIn addition to requiring the NDIA to pay the \nfull amount of costs incurred by McGarrigle in accessing his workplace and appropriate support services, the decision also potentially allows other people with a disability to seek transport costs for appropriate support fully, rather than partially, funded. \nThe NDIA appealed the decision to the Full \nCourt of the Federal Court. On 21 August 2017, the application for appeal was dismissed.LEGAL \nCASE\nSource 2 Liam McGarrigle\n15_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   507 17/10/2017   4:53 PM",

  "Page 533": "513  CHAPTER/uni00A015  RIGHT SAlso unlike the Australian Constitution, the US Constitution explicitly protects freedom of speech, in \nthe First Amendment. The case of Snyder v. Phelps 562 US 443 (2011) provides an example of how the \ncourts have upheld this/uni00A0right.Given the high rate of gun violence in America, it is not surprising that many state legislatures \nand the US Congress have, over the last decade, tried to implement gun reform to restrict the sale and purchase of guns. Such change has, however, been difficult to implement given the US Bill of Rights protection of the right to keep and bear arms (guns) via the Second Amendment, which states that \u2018a well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, [and] \nthe right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed\u2019. Court decisions have reinforced this/uni00A0right.\nFor example, in District of Columbia v. Heller, the US Supreme Court ruled that a ban on \nindividuals owing handguns, which was introduced by various states, including the District of Columbia (which includes the city of Washington and the White House) was unconstitutional and invalid because it infringed the right to bear arms (as stated in the Second Amendment). The Court ruled this right extended to the individual, not just the states\u2019 right to maintain militias and police forces. The reason for this decision was that a ban interfered with the lawful right of citizens to defend themselves.\nThis decision was later strengthened in McDonald v./uni00A0 Chicago. Otis McDonald challenged \na Chicago law, implemented in 1982, that required people to register their possession of a handgun. The court held the Chicago law breached an individual\u2019s right to keep and carry a gun, which was protected by the Bill of Rights.\nThe freedom of/uni00A0speech\nSnyder v. Phelps 562 US 443/uni00A0(2011)\nAlbert Snyder was the father of Matthew Snyder, a soldier killed in Iraq in 2006. In 2010, Albert brought a case against the Westboro Baptist Church (in the US state of Kansas) after members of the church disrupted and ruined Matthew\u2019s funeral. At the funeral, they held a protest outside and displayed posters claiming that \u2018God hates solders\u2019 and that Matthew \u2018deserved to die\u2019 as God\u2019s vengeance against America\u2019s growing acceptance of homosexuality, which in the Church\u2019s opinion is/uni00A0a/uni00A0sin.\nWhile Matthew\u2019s funeral had not been the only service disrupted \nby the Church, Snyder was the first person to take action against it claiming it had invaded his privacy and caused great emotional stress. By contrast, the Church claimed under the First Amendment it had a right to freedom of speech and a right to protest.\nIn the original trial, the state court found in favour of Snyder \nand the jury awarded him $10/uni00A0million in compensatory and punitive damages, which was later reduced to $5/uni00A0 million. However, the Church ultimately won the case after lodging a successful appeal in the US Court of Appeal (a federal court), which ruled that the Church\u2019s right to protest and freedom of speech was guaranteed by the First Amendment. In their decision, the judges stated that despite the \u2018distasteful and repugnant (disgusting) nature of the \nprotests\u2019, the (Church\u2019s) speech was constitutionally protected.LEGAL \nCASE\nSource 7 Members of the Westboro Baptist \nChurch protesting in the US.

  "Page 534": "514  UNIT  2 SANCTIONS, REMEDIES AND RIGHTSComparison to/uni00A0Australia\nAs we examined earlier in this chapter, the Australian Constitution only includes \ufb01ve relatively limited \nexpress rights, and so the constitutional protection of rights is vastly di\ufb00erent. For example, while the US Bill of Rights protects the broad and general right of the American people to freedom of religion, the Australian Constitution only expressly protects a limited right to freedom of religion in that the Commonwealth is prohibited (banned) from passing legislation that imposes or restricts religious practice. There is no mention of any restriction on the Australian states to make such/uni00A0laws.\nThe US Constitution also expressly contains and protects a broad range of rights that are not mentioned \nin the Australian Constitution including the right of the American people to freedom of speech, equal protection under the law, the right to keep and bear arms and not be subject to cruel punishment.\nRights within the/uni00A0US Constitution\u2019s structure\nIn addition to containing a Bill of Rights, the US Constitution also protects rights, in a similar way to the Australian Constitution, through its text and structure. That is, the US Constitution establishes various systems and parliamentary principles that indirectly protect the rights of the American people. For example, like Australia, the US Constitution also includes the parliamentary principle of representative government which ensures that Congress must be elected by the people and make laws that re\ufb02ect the views and values of the majority of people, which protects the right of the people to directly elect the Congress.\nIn addition, as in Australia, the US Constitution protects \nthe principle of separation of powers. In the US, the legislative, executive and judicially are kept separate at a federal level so that no one body or group can exercise all three powers. \nHowever, the US Constitution also expressly protects the right \nto vote for all US citizens aged over 18 (Eighteenth Amendment), which is not included in the Australian Constitution.\nImplied/uni00A0rights\nThe US legal system is based on English common law. As such, the US courts are able to resolve disputes involving an alleged breach of rights. \nThe US Supreme Court has the power to enforce the \nrights of the American people, including the rights protected by statute law and the US Constitution, and can declare any \nlegislation that infringes the basic rights of the American people to be invalid. The US Supreme Court can also imply the existence of rights when resolving constitutional disputes. It can also fully enforce all constitutional rights. If the court makes a ruling that legislation has infringed a right protected in the US Constitution, it can award a remedy, such as the payment of damages, to the party whose rights have been breached.\nIn a situation where the US Supreme Court does make a \nruling that legislation breaches the rights contained in the US Constitution, the Congress (like the Australian Commonwealth Parliament) cannot override this decision.\nSource 8 The structure of the US Constitution protects the \nright of the people to elect Congress through the principle of representative government.\nSource 9 The US Supreme/uni00A0Court\n15_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   514 17/10/2017   4:53 PM",
  "Page 535": "515  CHAPTER/uni00A015  RIGHT SInternational conventions and treaties\nLike Australia, the US also protects a range of basic rights by being a signatory to international human \nrights documents. However, many of the major international treaties to which the US is a signatory have not yet been fully rati\ufb01ed through the passing of local, state or federal legislation. For example, while President Obama signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities/uni00A0 in 2009, it has not yet been \nrati\ufb01ed. So while the US has its own local, state and federal laws to protect against discrimination, it has been slow to accept the international system of human rights protection, preferring to rely on its own internal laws and protections.\nSource 10 In January 2017, millions of people around the world, including approximately 500 000 in \nWashington US, joined the Women\u2019s March to demonstrate for the protection of women\u2019s rights.In accordance with the VCE Legal Studies Study Design, you are required to compare Australia\u2019s approach to the protection of rights with the approach of another country.

In its ruling, the US Supreme Court overturned the Connecticut state law, finding that it infringed people\u2019s right to privacy, which although not being explicitly stated in the US Constitution was implied to exist in various sections or amendments. In particular, the Fourth Amendment (covering the right of people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches) and the Fifth Amendment (right against self-incrimination) protected against government invasion of the sanctity of the home and the privacies of/uni00A0life.\nThe right to privacy was further extended in the case of Roe v./uni00A0Wade 410 US 113 (1973) to \ninclude the right of privacy in a doctor and patient relationship. In this case, which helped protect the right of a woman to have an abortion, the Supreme Court found that the discussion and advice given as part of the patient\u2013doctor relationship was a private matter, and accordingly, any state legislation that made certain abortions unlawful interfered with that private relationship. On this basis, the Supreme Court could declare such state law invalid. In this case the Court found the right of privacy was implied in the Fourteenth Amendment that provides that no state \u2018shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States\u2019.LEGAL \nCASE\n15_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   515 17/10/2017   4:53 PM",

  "Page 538": "518  UNIT  2 SANCTIONS, REMEDIES AND RIGHTSPOSSIBLE REFORMS TO THE PROTECTION \nOF RIGHTS IN AUSTRALIA15.8 \nAustralia has many laws and systems in place to ensure the rights and freedoms of all Australians are \nupheld. However, there are often concerns that the rights of particular individuals and groups and the community are not adequately protected. It is therefore important that the way we protect and enforce rights is constantly reviewed, and governments are willing to implement reforms to improve the protection of rights.\nThree possible reforms to the protection of rights in Australia include:\n\u2022 introducing a national charter or bill of/uni00A0rights\n\u2022 amending legislation and systems to provide increased protection to minority/uni00A0groups\u2022 increasing the availability of legal aid and assistance.\nShould Australia have a national charter or bill \nof/uni00A0rights?\nAustralia is the only Western democracy in the world that does not have a federal constitutional or \nstatutory charter or bill of rights. In fact, as we have examined earlier in this chapter, while the Australian Constitution does provide some structural protection of rights and the ability of the High Court to imply the existence of rights, it only contains \ufb01ve express rights. Similarly, while the Victorian and the Australian Capital Territory parliaments have passed legislation to establish a statutory protection of rights within their state and territory, the Commonwealth Parliament has not passed legislation to create a charter or bill of rights outlining the basic rights of all Australians.\nWhether or not Australia should have a charter or bill of rights is a topical issue. If Australia did adopt \na charter or bill of rights, it is commonly agreed that it would adopt a statutory approach. This means the Commonwealth Parliament would pass an Act of Parliament which sets out the basic rights for the Australian people. This is because the process of changing the Constitution to include more rights is very di\ufb03cult, as any change must be supported by a majority of the Australian public in a referendum, and a majority of electors in the majority of states. This would make it very unlikely that a proposal to include a comprehensive list of basic rights to the Constitution would be successful.\nstatutory approach  \nin relation to rights, the protection of rights through passing Acts of Parliament\nSource 1 Successive Australian Governments have been criticised by human rights groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch for their treatment of people seeking asylum in Australia.Arguments in/uni00A0favour \nof/uni00A0adopting a charter or bill of/uni00A0rights\nThose in favour of the introduction of a statutory \ncharter or bill of rights argue it/uni00A0would:\n\u2022 str engthen the protection of rights in Australia by \nclearly stating the basic rights of all citizens.

As we have seen earlier in this chapter, over recent years \norganisations such as Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the United Nations have \ncriticised the Australian Government for various breaches of human rights. This includes criticism in relation to its treatment of asylum seekers being held in detention, children being held in youth detention centres, poor human rights record with respect to Indigenous Australians and other minority groups, and its previous unwillingness to legislate for marriage equality.\nArguments against/uni00A0adopting a charter or bill of/uni00A0rights\nThose against the introduction of a charter or bill of rights argue/uni00A0that:\n\u2022 T he basic rights of Australians are already adequately protected by hundreds of Acts of Parliament, \nat both the state and Commonwealth levels such as the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth), the Child \nWellbeing and Safety Act 2005 (Vic) and Commonwealth legislation which makes slavery and people \ntra\ufb03cking a crime. Individuals who believe their rights have been breached are already able to challenge the matter through the court system.\n\u2022 Indi viduals who feel their rights are not protected by the law can try to in\ufb02uence the government \nto introduce a change in the law. If enough people support them, it is likely changes will occur. However, those in favour of a charter or bill of rights argue there are many minority groups, such as Indigenous Australians, people with a disability, children, women who are victims of family violence and those in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer (LGBTIQ) community, whose rights may be ignored.\n\u2022 T he Commonwealth has passed the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011 (Cth), which requires \nall proposed legislation to be checked for compatibility with rights, according to various international treaties. However, the parliament can choose to ignore suggestions that a proposed Act of Parliament will contravene a/uni00A0right.\n\u2022 A ustralia has already adopted and rati\ufb01ed many major international treaties and optional protocols that \nprotect a vast range of human rights such as the/uni00A0Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment of Punishment/uni00A0(CAT) (1985) and optional protocols.\nProviding increased protection to/uni00A0minority/uni00A0groups\nOne other possible reform to the improvement of the protection of rights in Australia is to amend existing legislation to improve legal processes, government policy and the provision of services in a range of areas. This is particularly important in those areas where governments have been accused of neglecting rights and failing to uphold Australia\u2019s obligations under international treaties and optional protocols. While Australia protects a vast range of rights, over recent years Australian governments have come under pressure to implement changes to improve the protection of rights/uni00A0for:\n\u2022 Indigenous Australians\u2022 asylum seekers\u2022 people accused of terror-related/uni00A0crimes\u2022 people with a disability\u2022 members of the LGBTIQ community.\n15_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   519 17/10/2017   4:53 PM",
  "Page 540": "520  UNIT  2 SANCTIONS, REMEDIES AND RIGHTSIndigenous Australians\nThe Australian Government has come under pressure to \nimprove the living standards of Indigenous Australians. Such changes could include improving access to health care, education and housing services and improving their access to and treatment by the legal system. Alarmingly, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are 13 times more likely to be imprisoned than non-Indigenous Australians and, while making up only 3 per cent of Australia\u2019s population, account for 27 per cent of the adult prison population and approximately 40 per cent of children in youth detention centres. It has \nalso been recommended that the Australian Constitution be changed to include recognition of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the \ufb01rst Australians.\nAsylum seekers\nThe Australian Government has come under pressure to signi\ufb01cantly improve the treatment of asylum seekers. This includes ensuring e\ufb03cient processing of their claims and abolishing Commonwealth Government policies and legislation that allows for the inde\ufb01nite detainment of asylum seekers in o\ufb00shore detention centres, under extremely harsh conditions (causing distress, con\ufb02ict and violence). Current policies have been criticised for failing to protect vulnerable individuals (especially women and children) and violating Australia\u2019s international responsibilities under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (1985).\nPeople accused of/uni00A0terror-related crimes\nWith the present threat of terrorism, the Government has been called upon to ensure that Commonwealth anti-terrorism laws do not breach basic human rights. The Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Act 2016 (Cth)/uni00A0 and the/uni00A0Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist O\ufb00enders) Act 2016 (Cth) amended the \nCommonwealth Criminal Code (the main legislation which establishes Commonwealth o\ufb00ences) to allow for the inde\ufb01nite detainment of convicted terrorists who have completed their sentence on the basis of relatively subjective claims. This legislation has been criticised by a number of human rights groups.\nPeople with/uni00A0disabilities\nThe Australian Government is under pressure to continue to implement state and federal reforms to support people with a disability, ensuring that they (and their family and carers) are treated in a manner that allows them to live an \u2018ordinary\u2019 life and have access to a range of basic services like health, education and housing support. Of particular concern is that a 2011 independent investigation estimated that 45 per cent of people with disability in Australia live near or below the poverty line, which is twice the OECD/uni00A0average.\nMembers of the LGBTIQ community\nAs popular support increased for the rights of the LGBTIQ community, the government is under continuous pressure to pass legislation to recognise members of this community. Same-sex marriage is legally recognised in countries including Belgium, Ireland, New Zealand and the United States among others. The introduction of laws in relation to marriage equality has varied by jurisdiction. In August 2017, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced that Australia will participate in a postal plebiscite to gauge \npublic opinion on the same-sex marriage debate.plebiscite \na direct vote by all members of an electorate on a matter of national significance that does not affect the Constitution.

For  example, a person may  be discouraged from taking a case to  \ncourt because they cannot a\ufb00ord  the cost of legal representation, gathering evidence and court fees or are  \ndeterred by  the prospect of being involved in a lengthy legal battle (that may  then be challenged through \nthe appeal process).\nTo address this issue, more state  and federal funding could be allocated to  legal aid and assistance \nbodies, such as Victoria Legal Aid.

Perhaps one of the most well-known and important cases is Mabo v Queensland (No. 2) (1992) 175 CLR 1, more commonly known as the Mabo case. In this case, the High Court made the historic \ndecision to overrule the long-established false common law principle that Australia was terra nullius (i.e. \nan \u2018empty land\u2019) when it was colonised by the British in 1788. In doing so the High Court recognised land rights for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.\nIn this and the next topic you will explore the facts, issues and outcome of the Mabo case, the role of \npeople involved in this case, how it impacted on the rights of individuals and the legal system, and any con\ufb02icting attitudes associated with the/uni00A0case.\nEddie/uni00A0Mabo\nEdward Koiki Sambo was an Indigenous Australian born on 29 June 1936 on a small island in the Torres \nStrait known as Murray Island. In the language of the native Meriam people, the island is called \nMer. He was the \ufb01fth child of Robert and Poipe Sambo. His mother died shortly after he was \nborn and he was adopted by his uncle Benny Mabo and his wife, Maiga Mabo. By islander \nlaw, Edward Koiki became Benny Mabo\u2019s son and could inherit Mabo land. He became \nknown as Eddie/uni00A0Mabo.\nEddie Mabo dedicated his life to \ufb01ght for the land rights of his people. In 1982, Eddie \nMabo and four other members of the Meriam people \u2013 Sam Passi, David Passi, Celuia Mapo Salee and James Rice \u2013 joined together to have their traditional ownership of \nthe island of Mer in the Torres Strait legally recognised. The case was brought as a test \ncase  to determine the legal rights of the Indigenous Meriam people. The \ufb01nal High Court \ndecision established an important legal principle and precedent that recognised the right \nof all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to have native title over their traditional/uni00A0land.\nWithout Eddie Mabo and the four other members of the Meriam people who joined him \nhaving the courage to initiate court proceedings against the Queensland Government, this case would \nnever have been resolved. It may have taken many more years for Indigenous land rights to be recognised. This is because an individual or party can only take a dispute before the courts for resolution if they have a standing in the case (locus standi). This Latin term literally means \u2018place of standing\u2019 and means that the issues or matters in the case directly a\ufb00ect them. In relation to the Mabo case, only a member of the Meriam people, whose right to ownership of their traditional land was being denied by the Queensland Government, could have taken the case to/uni00A0court.\nThe facts and issues central to/uni00A0the/uni00A0case\nBefore colonisation\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples occupied Australia for a minimum of 75 000/uni00A0 years before the \n\ufb01rst British colony was established. They spoke their own languages and had their own laws and customs. An essential part of their laws and customs is a strong connection to the/uni00A0land.terra nullius  \na false common law principle that Australia was an \u2018empty land\u2019 and belonged to no one when the British first arrived and established colonisation in the late/uni00A01700s\ntest/uni00A0case  \na legal action undertaken with the aim of having the court establish a legal principle or precedent which can be followed for future similar cases\nlocus standi  \na Latin term meaning \u2018standing in a case\u2019; that is, the litigant must be directly affected by the issues or matters involved in the case for the court to be able to hear and determine the caseSource 1 Eddie/uni00A0Mabo\n15_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   522 17/10/2017   4:53 PM",
  "Page 543": "523  CHAPTER/uni00A015  RIGHT SAfter colonisation\nIn 1788, the British claimed sovereignty over part of Australia and established a colony. In 1889, the British \ncourts applied the doctrine of terra nullius to Australia. This meant that the British regarded the land of \nAustralia as \u2018nobody\u2019s land\u2019 or \u2018empty land\u2019 when it was colonised.\nThe birth of/uni00A0a campaigner\nWhen Eddie Mabo was growing up, the Torres Strait Islands were administered by Queensland\u2019s Chief Protector of Aborigines and the Department of Native A\ufb00airs. The department provided every island child with schooling, but this was very limited and it was assumed that no child would progress beyond primary school.\nMabo became disillusioned with his lack of rights. He \nstarted drinking heavily and was exiled from the Torres Strait Islands. Even 15/uni00A0 years later he was not allowed to return.\nIn the 1960s, Mabo threw himself into the campaign \nto give Indigenous people the right to be counted in the census. Vigorous campaigning led to increased support for the rights of Indigenous people. In 1967, a referendum was held and was successful in bringing about a change in the Constitution to allow the Commonwealth Parliament to legislate in respect of Aboriginal people.\nDuring the campaign, Mabo initiated a conference in Townsville called the Inter-Racial Seminar. Mabo \nurged the conference to address issues of employment, housing, education and Indigenous civil rights.\nPublic support for land rights grew quickly in the late 1960s. The Australian Labor Party, trade unions \nand churches were behind the demand for change.\nMabo land rights campaign\nThe election of the Whitlam Labor Government in December 1972 led to increased money for Indigenous programs. Eddie Mabo became involved in the Townsville Aboriginal and Islander Legal Service and the Townsville Aboriginal and Islander Health Service. He was elected president of Yumba Meta, a housing association that purchased houses in Townsville to be rented by Indigenous people, using Commonwealth/uni00A0funds.\nFollowing this, Mabo became a full-time community activist. He needed money to live so he worked \nat James Cook University, Townsville, as a gardener. During his time there he spent every spare minute in the university library, reading all he could about his people and country, including the six-volume report on the Torres Strait by the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition. He became very knowledgeable about the Torres Strait Islands and he also had \ufb01rsthand knowledge, being an Islander himself. He used this knowledge to give lectures on the subject to students at the university.\nThe 1981 Land Rights Conference\nMabo\u2019s real push for land rights began in the 1980s. He attended the Land Rights Conference in 1981 and explained his position on land rights.\nThe following extract is from Eddie Mabo\u2019s address to the Land Rights Conference in 1981. \nSource 2 An Indigenous school in Queensland in the/uni00A01950s\n15_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   523 17/10/2017   4:53 PM",

It is interesting to note that our struggle for land rights has attracted so many of our fellow white Australians to join with us. Some larger institutions such as the churches and trade unions have also made public announcements giving their support for Aboriginal and Islander land rights claims. \nIn the Torres Strait, landownership is the same throughout. It is different from Aboriginal \nlandownership on the mainland. Although we have tribal regions, we go much further into the clan area and then to individual or family holdings. This system existed as long as we could remember. When the first white men arrived in our islands they found people as village dwellers who lived in permanent houses and in well-kept villages. They also discovered that we were expert gardeners and hunters.\nThe land was inherited always by the male descendants just as male children in white \nsocieties always retained the family name. The terms we use for the male name-holders are Neai Borom or Neai Lied-Lied. Girls inherited land only in cases where the couple had no male children. In some instances, daughters were given land as a wedding present.\nBefore the father died, or during his lifetime, he would make sure that his family and \nfriends knew his wish as to which one of his sons would be the heir to his land. He would also insist that the heir to his land must not deprive the rest of his sons or daughters of the use of his land. In most instances the decision for the use of their father\u2019s land remains at the goodwill of the heir. Such was the case of my father allowing his sisters to garden in the land that I/uni00A0now inherit.\nSource: Eddie Mabo, \u2018Eddie Koiki Mabo: Land Rights in the Torres Strait\u2019 \n(Address delivered at the Land Rights Conference, Townsville, 1981)EXTRACT\nSource 3 The Torres Strait\n15_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   524 17/10/2017   4:53 PM",
  "Page 545": "525  CHAPTER/uni00A015  RIGHT SThe most important ingredient that was  missing was  money. Mabo often had to  rely on the benevolence \nof family members and friends to  help him to  attend court or hold meetings to  raise support for  their \ncause. As the work  intensi\ufb01ed, so  did the search for  funding. The  breakthrough came with a $50 000 \nCommonwealth Government grant, just as the statement of claim was  ready to  be/uni00A0\ufb01led.\nThe case could not have  continued without the help of lawyers who were  prepared to  work  for nothing. \nMabo was  unable to  work  because he was  required to  attend conferences, make statements and go  around \nthe country trying to  raise money.

This meant that Indigenous Australians had no \nproperty rights.

In this case,  Justice \nBlackburn concluded that the doctrine of native title did not form  part of the law  of Australia.\nFollowing this case,  the then prime minister, William McMahon, responded by  promising a policy \nstatement on Indigenous access to  land.

Justice Moynihan, of the Supreme Court, was appointed to hear all the evidence, determine the facts and report back to the High Court in Canberra.\nOn 13 October 1986, proceedings commenced in Brisbane and Eddie Mabo was called to give \nevidence. He was questioned by his barristers, Keon-Cohen and Castan QC. He then faced 10/uni00A0days of gruelling cross-examination by the Queensland Government\u2019s well-briefed lawyers. His evidence became the focus of the attack by the Queensland Government.\nJustice Moynihan of the Supreme Court described the case in the following/uni00A0terms:\nThe case pleaded and particularised was claims by the various individual plainti\ufb00s in respect of very \nspeci\ufb01c pieces of land or areas of sea or reef. And their claims, their individual claims, were founded on chains of descent \u2026 for example, \u2018I\u2019m Eddie Mabo, I/uni00A0claim this piece of land which is situated here, which has this description and I/uni00A0claim it because I/uni00A0was adopted into a particular family and there is a line of descent\u2019 . And in that sense it was almost a series of mini cases in respect of each piece of land claimed by each plainti\ufb00/uni00A0\u2026\nThe Murray Islander witnesses explained Meriam custom and the sacred \nlaws, which underpin both their traditional rights and obligations to land and \nsea. The Meriam people are the people of the Torres Strait Islands.\nThe Meriam people\u2019s laws relate to occupation of the land, and trespass \nand inheritance. These laws are fundamental to their traditional system of ownership. They hoped this evidence would establish the Murray Islander claim to those areas of land, sea and reef speci\ufb01ed in the court documents.\nThe Islanders had to \ufb01ght two entrenched principles of the Australian \nlegal system. These were the concept of terra nullius and the principle of sovereignty over all the land of Australia, which it was claimed abolished any \nnative title rights that may have existed before colonisation.\nThere were 27 witnesses ranging from one man aged over 80 to young \nmen and/uni00A0women.\nIn May 1989, the Supreme Court of Queensland visited Murray Island to \nhear evidence. By later that year, Mabo and James Rice were the only plainti\ufb00s left and Rice was under pressure to withdraw as a plainti\ufb00. Celuia Salee had died shortly after the claim had been \ufb01led. The Reverend David Passi and his brother Sam Passi both withdrew as plainti\ufb00s.\nThe Supreme Court hearings were completed in Brisbane on 6 September 1989, and Justice Moynihan \nthen faced a formidable task. His task was to decide on the facts surrounding the Murray Islanders\u2019 claims. He had to sort through the con\ufb02icting evidence of 44 witnesses, which, together with the submissions from both sides, generated 3464 pages of transcript. There were also more than 330 exhibits.\nJustice Moynihan\u2019s decision in the Supreme Court of Queensland was handed down on 16 November \n1990, more than four years after Mabo \ufb01rst entered the witness box. He ruled that Mabo\u2019s claims must be denied.\nSource 1 The legal ownership of Mer (Murray \nIsland), located in the Torres Strait between Australia and Papua New Guinea, was at the centre of the Mabo/uni00A0case.\n15_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   526 17/10/2017   4:53 PM",

The High Court justices retired to consider their verdict \nand write their judgments. It took many months before the decision was \ufb01nally announced in June 1992. The journey through the courts had taken 10/uni00A0years, and it had taken its toll on Eddie/uni00A0Mabo.\nAll of the judges, except Justice Dawson, agreed/uni00A0that:\n\u2022 there was a concept of native title at common/uni00A0law\n\u2022 the source of native title was the traditional connection to or occupation of the/uni00A0land\u2022 the nature and content of native title was determined by the character of the connection or occupation \nunder traditional laws or customs\n\u2022 na tive title could be extinguished by the valid exercise of governmental powers provided a clear and \nplain intention to do so was manifest.\nThe order of the court was a declaration which, in part, reads as follows:\n(2) that the Meriam people are entitled as against the whole world to possession, occupation, use and \nenjoyment of the island of Mer except for that parcel of land leased to the Trustees of the Australian \nBoard of Missions and those parcels of land (if any) which have been validly appropriated for use for administrative purposes the use of which is inconsistent with the continued enjoyment of the rights and privileges of Meriam people under native/uni00A0title;\n(3) that the title of the Meriam people is subject to the power of the Parliament of Queensland and the \npower of the Governor in Council of Queensland to extinguish that title by valid exercise of their respective powers, provided any exercise of those powers is not inconsistent with the laws of the Commonwealth.\nPut simply, the decision said that under Australian law, Indigenous people have rights to land, that \nthese rights had existed before colonisation and still exist. This right is called native/uni00A0title.\nBy a majority of six to one, the High Court ruled that native title to land is recognised by the common \nlaw of Australia. This \ufb01nding threw out the notion that when the land was \u2018discovered\u2019 by Captain Cook \nin 1788 it was terra nullius, an empty land or \u2018land belonging to no one\u2019 .

The main difference between those members of the Court who constitute the majority is that, subject to the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth), neither of us nor Brennan J./uni00A0agrees with the conclusion to be drawn from the judgments of Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ./uni00A0that, at least in the absence of clear and unambiguous statutory provision to the contrary, extinguishment of native title by the Crown by inconsistent grant is wrongful and gives rise to a claim for compensatory damages. We note that the judgment of Dawson J./uni00A0supports the conclusion of Brennan J./uni00A0and ourselves on that aspect of the case since his Honour considers that native title, where it exists, is a form of permissive occupancy at the will of the/uni00A0Crown.\n3 We are authorised to say that the other members of the Court agree with what is said in the \npreceding paragraph about the outcome of the/uni00A0case.\n4 The formal order to be made by the Court accords with the declaration proposed by \nBrennan/uni00A0J./uni00A0but is cast in a form which will not give rise to any possible implication affecting the status of land which is not the subject of the declaration in par.2 of the formal/uni00A0order.\nBRENNAN J./uni00A0The Murray Islands lie in the Torres Strait, at about 10 degrees S./uni00A0Latitude \nand 144 degrees E./uni00A0Longitude. They are the easternmost of the Eastern Islands of the Strait. \nTheir total land area is of the order of nine square kilometres. The biggest is Mer (known also as Murray Island), oval in shape about 2.79 kms long and about 1.65 kms across. A/uni00A0channel about 900 m./uni00A0wide separates Mer from the other two islands, Dauar and Waier, which lie closely adjacent to each other to the south of Mer. The Islands are surrounded for the most part by fringing reefs. The people who were in occupation of these Islands before first European contact and who have continued to occupy those Islands to the present day are known as the Meriam people. Although outsiders, relatively few in number, have lived on the Murray Islands from time to time and worked as missionaries, government officials, or fishermen, there has not been a permanent immigrant population.\nAnthropological records and research show that the present inhabitants of the Islands \nare descended from the people described in early European reports. The component of foreign ancestry among the present population is small compared with most communities living in the Torres Strait.\nThe Meriam people of today retain a strong sense of affiliation with their forbears and \nwith the society and culture of earlier times.

The exception to this is where valid Australian law meant the land was legally owned, or used by others, for example private land for housing.\nThe death of/uni00A0Mabo\nSadly, Eddie Mabo died on 21 January 1992, just \ufb01ve months before the High Court\u2019s \ufb01nal decision was handed down. For 10/uni00A0years his passion, intelligence and commitment had driven the case forward, from its beginning through to the \ufb01nal arguments put to the High Court. The claim could not have been pursued without/uni00A0him.\nThe Australian newspaper selected Eddie Mabo as Australian of the Y ear on 26 January/uni00A01993.\nThe impact on/uni00A0the rights of/uni00A0individuals and \nthe/uni00A0legal/uni00A0system\nThe High Court\u2019s Mabo decision had a profound e\ufb00ect on the whole nation. According to Justice Michael \nKirby (a former High Court justice), the basic principles of the Mabo decision/uni00A0are:\n\u2022 our system of real property law accommodates native/uni00A0title\u2022 native title may be extinguished\u2022 it may be extinguished in a number of ways either by the Crown or by the Indigenous people themselves\n\u2022 where it has been extinguished there may (or may not) be a right to compensation.\nThe High Court\u2019s rejection of terra nullius, and recognition of native title, has led to legislation being \npassed to clarify the situation and protect property interests. It has generated intense political debate \nand vast amounts of academic writing. Media attention was enormous at the time and the case still creates interest.\nThe decision fundamentally altered the legal, political and social relations between Indigenous and \nnon-Indigenous people. In recognising the traditional rights of Murray Islanders, the case has recognised the rights of all Indigenous people who have a continued connection to their land. The decision changed Australia and the Australian legal system forever.More information on \nthe life of Eddie Mabo and the Mabo case can be found in the ABC documentary Mabo \u2013 Life of an Island Man (1997).

  "Page 550": "530  UNIT  2 SANCTIONS, REMEDIES AND RIGHTSThe Native Title Act 1993/uni00A0(Cth)\nThe Commonwealth Parliament passed the Native Title Act in December 1993. The Act established the \nNative Title Tribunal and con\ufb01rmed the Mabo decision. The Act protects people\u2019s homes and businesses by validating titles granted after/uni00A01975.\nThe purposes of the Native Title Act/uni00A0are:\n\u2022 to provide for the recognition and protection of native title, and to set down some basic principles in \nrelation to native/uni00A0title\n\u2022 to establish ways in which future dealings a\ufb00ecting native title may proceed and be protected\n\u2022 to establish a mechanism for determining claims to native/uni00A0title\u2022 to provide for a range of other matters, including the establishment of a National Aboriginal and \nTorres Strait Islander Land/uni00A0Fund.The Native Title Amendment Act 2009 (Cth) amended the Native Title Act to give the Federal Court a \ncentral role in managing native title claims and expands provisions for mediation of native title claims.\nThe Wik decision\nThe Mabo decision and the subsequent Native Title Act did not resolve the issues of native title on pastoral \nleases and native title to the seas. The pastoral lease issue was decided by the High Court in its 1996 Wik  \ndecision (being Wik Peoples v Queensland (1996) 187 CLR/uni00A01).\nPastoral leases are a form of land tenure unique to Australia created by the British Colonial O\ufb03ce after \nconcern by British o\ufb03cials over the massive land grab by squatters in the 1830s and 1840s. The British \nauthorities explicitly stated the leases did not grant squatters exclusive tenure, but that the land was owned on behalf of the Australian public by the government.\nIn the Wik  case, the governments argued that the mere granting of a pastoral lease last century \nextinguishes native title, even though the land was never developed.\nThe High Court decided that native title rights could coexist with the rights of pastoralists on cattle \nand sheep stations. The Court also said that when pastoralists and Indigenous rights were in con\ufb02ict, the pastoralists\u2019 rights would prevail, giving pastoralists certainty to continue with grazing and related activities.\nThe pastoralists wanted native title wiped out completely on pastoral leases. Conservative leaders \nbacked their demands. The then Howard Government followed the Wik  decision with the Native Title \nAmendment Act 1998 (Cth), which amended the Native Title Act to incorporate a 10-point plan for native title. The plan not only e\ufb00ectively extinguished native title on pastoral leases, but also on other types of landholdings such as Crown land (government land), waterways and airspace.\nThe National Indigenous Working Group on Native Title (NIWG) \nlaunched a major campaign against the 10-point plan. NIWG put forward a plan for negotiation with Indigenous Australians to achieve coexistence. The Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation (ANTaR) gathered support from the broader Australian community. This support continued to/uni00A0grow.\nThe United Nations Committee for the Elimination of Racial \nDiscrimination asked Australia to explain its native title changes.\nSince this time, a number of changes have been made to the Native \nTitle Act to improve its e\ufb00ectiveness and make it fairer for Indigenous Australians.\nSource 3 Eddie Mabo\u2019s wife, Bonita\n15_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   530 17/10/2017   4:53 PM",

They  \nconducted a massive fear campaign against the newly established land rights of Indigenous Australians.\nIndigenous land councils and other Aboriginal organisations throughout Australia lobbied the \nCommonwealth Government to  legislate to  protect any  native title that had survived 200/uni00A0 years of  \ncolonisation. At the same time, sections of the mining and pastoral industries and conservative politicians \nlobbied the Commonwealth Government to  overturn the Mabo decision.\nIn 2004, a study seeking public opinion towards  Mabo found that not everyone was  in favour of  land \nrights for  Indigenous people. The  Australian Election Study was  based on information obtained from \nsurveys. Twenty-\ufb01ve per cent of the respondents in the 2004 survey felt that change in Aboriginal land rights had not gone far  enough. Almost twice that many considered that change had gone too  far. In \naddition, about one-third of the respondents were  of the view that change had been to  the right extent. In \nother words, most of the respondents were  either satis\ufb01ed with the progress in land rights or were  of the \nview that the progress had gone too/uni00A0far.\nThe study found that those with fewer years of education, working class background, home owners \nand those who felt \u2018very proud\u2019 to  be Australian were  more likely to  report that the changes to  Aboriginal \nland rights over  the years had gone too/uni00A0far.\nAustralians\u2019 once-hard attitudes against Indigenous people have  softened remarkably over  the past two  \ndecades, election research/uni00A0shows.\nThe proportion of voters who felt Indigenous Australians\u2019 land rights were  excessive fell between 1996 \nand 2010, from 61 per cent to  35 per/uni00A0cent.\nCHECK YOUR LEARNING 15.10 \nDe\ufb01ne and explain\n1 What is native title?\n2 Explain the decision in the Mabo case.

But should freedom of speech be limited? For  example, should individuals have  the right \nto make o\ufb00ensive or insulting remarks about another \nperson on the basis of their race or should making such comments be unlawful?\nIn 1975, the Commonwealth Parliament passed \nthe Racial Discrimination Act  1975 (Cth) (RDA), a law  \ndesigned to  ensure that all people, regardless of their \nnationality and background, are  treated equally by  \nmaking it illegal to  discriminate against a person on \nthe basis of their colour, race, or national or ethnic origin. Section 18C of the RDA  makes it unlawful for  a \nperson to  undertake an act that is reasonably likely to  \n\u2018o\ufb00end, insult, humiliate or intimidate\u2019 another person or group due to  their race or ethnicity.\nIn 2014, the Liberal-National coalition created \ncontroversy and debate by  announcing their intention \nto, among other changes, alter section 18C in the RDA  \nby removing the words \u2018o\ufb00end, insult and humiliate\u2019 \nand adding the words \u2018racial vili\ufb01cation\u2019 so it is only an o\ufb00ence to  undertake action that \u2018intimidates or \nvili\ufb01es\u2019 another person or group on basis of their race or ethnicity.\nThe proposed changes to  the RDA  were  introduced \nby the Australian Government in response to  a 2011 \ndecision of the Federal Court. In this case, a judge ruled that controversial journalist Andrew Bolt breached section 18C of the RDA  when he wrote \na series of columns and a blog (one under the title \u2018White is the new black\u2019). In those publications, Bolt expressed the view that some \u2018fair skinned Aboriginal people\u2019 sought to  gain \u2018professional advantage\u2019 (which \nmight include being eligible for  government \ufb01nancial \ngrants and advancing in their chosen careers) by  \nidentifying themselves as Aboriginal or,  as Mr Bolt \nstated, by  the \u2018colour of their/uni00A0skin\u2019 .\nIn his decision, Federal Court Justice Bromberg \nheld that Mr Bolt\u2019s comments (and the actions of the Herald and Weekly Times (HWT) who published the ar\nticles) were  reasonably likely to  \u2018o\ufb00end, insult, \nhumiliate or intimidate\u2019 some Aboriginal persons of mixed descent or ancestral heritage. \nIn November 2013, the newly appointed Attorney-\nGeneral, George Brandis, announced that he would seek to  have  the Commonwealth Parliament change \n15_FIL_AJ_SB12_13e_10325_TXT_SI.indd   536 17/10/2017   4:53 PM",

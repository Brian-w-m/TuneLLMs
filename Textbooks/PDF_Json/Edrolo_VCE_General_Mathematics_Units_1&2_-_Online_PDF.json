The median is the middle value of an ordered \ndata set . \nIn a data set with n values, the median is located in the     (\u200b\u202fn\u2004+\u2004 1\u202f_\u202f2\u202f\u200b)\u200b\u200b\u200b\u202fth\n   position. \nIf there is an even number of data values, the median is the average of the two midd le values.\nFor example, if there are 20 values in the data set,   (\u200b\u202fn\u2004+\u2004 1\u202f_\u202f2\u202f\u200b) \u2004=\u200410.5  . On either side of 10.5 are \nthe 10th and 11th values. The median is the average of these two values.\nWhen\u200bfinding\u200bthe\u200bmedian\u200bfrom\u200btables\u200band\u200bcharts,\u200bit\u200bcan\u200bbe\u200bdetermined \u200beither\u200bby\u200binspection \u200bor\u200b\nby\u200bfirst\u200blisting\u200bthe\u200bdata  in ascending order .See worked example 1\nSee worked example 2KEY TERMS\n \u2022Centre\n \u2022Median\n \u2022Spread\n \u2022Range\n \u2022Interquartile range\n \u2022QuartilesKEY SKILLS\nDuring this lesson, you will be:\n \u2022determining the median \n \u2022calculating the range\n \u2022calculating the interquartile range.\nWorked example 1\nFor the following data set, determine the median.\n43\u2003252\u2003465\u2003859\u2003245\u2003492\u200345 3\u200348\u2003239\u20034\nExplanation\nStep 1:  Rearrange the data set in ascending order.\n\u200b4\u200343\u200348\u2003239\u2003245\u2003252\u2003453\u2003465\u2003492\u2003859\nStep 2:  Count the number of values in the data set .\n n\u2004=\u2004 10Step 3:  Determine the position of the median.\n The median is locat ed in the    (\u200b\u202fn\u2004+\u2004 1\u202f_\u202f2\u202f\u200b)\u200b\u200b\u200b\u202fth\n   position.\n   \u202f10\u2004+\u20041\u202f_\u202f2\u202f \u2004=\u20045.5  \n Since there are an even number of values, the median \nis the average of the 5th and 6th values.\nContinues \u2192\n\t \u20021D\u2002Summari Sing numerical DaTa \u2013 me Dian, range an D iQr 29\nThis document is intended for Kayne STANTON at Albert Park College (user ID: 2399298).\nUnauthorised circulation in any form is not permitted.",

It shows the distribution of the values in a data set within certain intervals. Constructing boxplots from numerical data sets allows conclusions to be drawn about the distribution.\nCalculating the five-number summary\nWhen there is a set of numerical data that is arranged in ascending order, a five-number \nsummary can be created. A five-number summary  summarises the distribution of a data set, \nas well as providing key information about the spread and centre.\nThe five figures included in the summary are: minimum, lower quartile (    Q \u202f1    ), median (   Q \u202f2   ),  \nupper quartile (   Q \u202f3   ), and maximum.\nThe minimum  is the smallest value in the data set, while the maximum  value is the largest \nvalue in the data set.\nFor example, the five-number summary for the data set 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 is:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nQ3Q1maximum minimum median\nMinimum: 1\nFirst quartile (   Q \u202f1   ): 3\nMedian (   Q \u202f2   ): 5.5\nThird quartile (   Q \u202f3   ): 8\nMaximum: 10\n\t \u20021F\u2002The FIve-number summ Ary And boxplo Ts 47\nThis document is intended for Kayne STANTON at Albert Park College (user ID: 2399298).\nUnauthorised circulation in any form is not permitted.",

The type of \ndata indicates what type of comparison will be made. Data on prices should be compared in terms of which category is cheaper or more expensive. Data on heights should be interpreted  in terms of which category is shorter or taller.\nThe median can be compared and interpreted to determine which category is higher or lower.  \nIn addition to this, the IQR and range can be compared to determine which category has a  larger spread. The data set with a larger spread is considered to be \u2018more variable\u2019.\n1H\u2002THEORY\n\t \u20021H\u2002Comparing da Ta dis Tribu Tions CHapTer 1: inVes Tiga Ting and C omparing da Ta dis TribuTions\u2002 \t 73\nThis document is intended for Kayne STANTON at Albert Park College (user ID: 2399298).\nUnauthorised circulation in any form is not permitted.",

While they can be used in a financial context, they are  \nbroadly applicable across many aspects of everyday life, and are useful when expressing \nproportions and making comparisons of different quantities.\nIdentifying and simplifying ratios\nA ratio  is a set of numbers in the form  a\u2004:\u2004b   (read as \u2018  a  to  b \u2019) that expresses the relationship \nbetween two or more quantities or sizes. They are an effective way to state the proportions  \nof quantities or amounts, expressed in the same units, without stating specific amounts.\nFor example, a car park may contain 4 blue cars, 5 white cars and 2 green cars.The ratio of blue cars to white cars to green cars is 4\u2004:\u20045\u2004:\u20042.The ratio of white cars to total cars is 5\u2004:\u200411.The ratio of green cars to other cars is 2\u2004:\u20049.Note: The order of the stated ratio is important. The ratio 2\u2004:\u20041 is not the same as the ratio 1\u2004:\u20042.Ratios can be simplified if all of the values within the ratio have a common factor other than 1.

  "Page 91": "Identifying and simplifying rates\nA rate  is a comparison of two quantities that are related to each other. Whereas ratios compare \nquantities of similar type (such as red cars and blue cars), rates are not limited in the same  \nway and can compare any two quantities. The second quantity is often time, so that the rate expresses the rate of change per unit of time. Examples of this include kilometres per hour, metres per second, or orders delivered per day. \nAs with ratios, rates can be simplified. In the case of rates, they are usually simplified so that  \nthe first quantity is expressed per one unit of the second quantity. This means that a highest common factor doesn\u2019t need to be found to simplify a rate.\nFor example, a student wants to analyse how efficient they are at finishing a multiple choice \nexam. They work for an hour and complete 30 multiple choice questions. Depending on how they want to analyse their efficiency, the student may say that they average 0.5 questions  per minute, or 2 minutes per question. \nWorked example 3\nIn 2009, Usain Bolt set the world record 100 m sprint time of 9.58 seconds. On average, how fast did Bolt travel in m/s, correct to two decimal places?\nExplanation\nStep 1:  Determine appropriate division to simplify the rate.\n The question ask s to express the rate in metres  \nper second. The quantities need to be simplified  so that \u2018metres\u2019 is expressed per one second.\nStep 2:\n Divide the metres ran by the number of seconds taken.\n  100\u2004\u00f7\u20049.58\u2004=\u200410.438...  \nAnswer\n10.44 m/s\nPerforming calculations with rates and ratios\nMultiplication and division can be applied to both rates and ratios to further investigate  real-world scenarios.\nFor example, a ratio of 3\u2004:\u20045\u2004:\u20042\u2004:\u20048 could represent the allocation of tasks between a group of \nfour people. Depending on the total number of tasks, division can be used to determine exactly how many tasks each person completes.\nRatios can also indicate the scaling of one quantity to another. For example, a ratio of 10\u2004:\u20041 could  \nrepresent the scale of a building to a model of the building. Multiplication and division can be used  \nto determine the size of each depending on which value is known.Multiplication and division can be used to convert rates into different units.For example a speed of 50 km/h is equivalent to 13.89 m/s.See worked example 4\nSee worked example 5\nSee worked example 6\n2A\u2002THEORY\nCha PTeR 2: F Inan CIal a RIThme TIC\u2002\t 84\nThis document is intended for Kayne STANTON at Albert Park College (user ID: 2399298).\nUnauthorised circulation in any form is not permitted.",

As inflation continues over time, the spending power of money reduces. For example, $1 in 1900 could buy much more than what $1 in 2000 could. This is because when the general price of goods and services increases, each unit of currency is able to purchase less goods or services. \nTo determine the future spending power of an amount of money, the original amount of money \nis \u2018deflated\u2019, as spending power decreases according to the rate of inflation.

This means that there are various kinds of purchase \noptions that can be used depending on the circumstance. It is useful to understand the features of these purchase options, and to be able to compare purchase options to decide which would be most suitable in a given situation.\nEvaluating cash and card purchase options\nThe three most common ways to pay for something are with cash, using a debit card or using  \na credit card.\nCash is a form of physical currency, such as coins and notes.Debit cards are cards that allow the cardholder to electronically transfer money they have saved \nfrom a linked bank account in order to make a payment . \nCredit cards are cards that allow the cardholder to make a payment using the bank\u2019s money, \nwhich must then be repaid by the cardholder according to the terms of the credit card.\nDebit and credit cards are used to make EFTPOS payments, which means Electronic Funds \nTransfer at Point of Sale. Often, a surcharge will be applied to EFTPOS payments, where the  cardholder will be charged a small percentage on top of whatever amount they are required to pay.\nDifferent credit card providers have different rules and costs associated with usage and typically \nincurs a fixed annual fee, and a variable fee that represents the cost of borrowing.\nInterest refers to the variable fee charged by lenders as a cost for borrowing. For a credit card, \ninterest is typically calculated as a percentage of the balance outstanding and compou nds daily.\nCredit cards generally have a billing period , also known as the statement period, which is the \nregular period of time in which the bank sends a statement of purchases made, including the amount owing, the minimum payment and the due date. The billing cycle is typically monthly. \nMany credit cards have an interest-free period , which is the number of days between the \npurchase date and the date that the monthly balance is due where the bank does not charge \ninterest. The interest-free period is commonly up to 55 days. For example, an item purchased  \non the 1\nst day of a billing cycle will receive 55 interest-free days whereas an item purchased on \nthe 30th day of a 30-day billing cycle will receive 26 interest-free days.

For example, a home loan is used for purchasing residential \nproperty while a car loan can only be used to purchase vehicles. \nTwo types of more generic purchase options are personal loans and buy now pay later schemes.A personal loan  is typically between $5000 and $50 000 and usually needs to be paid back \nwithin 7 years. This type of loan is commonly used for items such as furniture, appliances, cars \nand family holidays. Personal loans generally have the following main  features:\n \u2022Interest is calculated based on the original borrow ed amount.\n \u2022Regular payments (e.g. weekly, fortnightly, mont hly, etc.)\n \u2022A set duration of time within which the repayments will reduce the balance of the l oan to $0.\nA buy now pay later scheme is generally used for purchases under $2000, where the amount is paid over 4 or more equal payments rather than made upfront. Popular buy now pay later scheme providers in Australia include Afterpa y and Zip.\nBuy now pay later schemes often do not charge interest if the amount is low and the payment is made within a matter of weeks or months. However, providers may charge establishment fees, monthly fees and late fees.\nWhile buy now pay later schemes can be useful for consumers from a budgeting perspective, \nand to pay for necessary items, it can cause some to overspend as the lower regular payments may seem more affordable than a larger upfront payment.See worked example 3\nSee worked example 4\n2E\u2002THEORY\n\t \u20022e\u2002purChase op TIons ChapTer 2: FInanCIal arIThmeTIC\u2002 \t 115\nThis document is intended for Kayne STANTON at Albert Park College (user ID: 2399298).\nUnauthorised circulation in any form is not permitted.",

This can be used to predict future values, such as the decreasing value  \nof a laptop.\nIdentifying arithmetic and geometric sequences\nA sequence is a set of numbers arranged in a particular order. Each number in a sequence is \nreferred to as a term. For example, in the sequence\n\u22124, 7, 9, \u22122, \u22123,\u22124 is the first term, 7 is the second term, and so on. If a sequence has a pattern, the next term can be predicted. If the pattern is repeated addition  \nor subtraction of a constant value , the sequence is arithmetic . For example, in the sequence\n\u22122, 4, 10, 16,\neach term has 6 added to it to find the next.\n\u22122, 4, 10, 16+6 +6 +6\nIf the pattern is repeated multiplication of a constant value , the sequence is geometric.

For example, the decreasing height, in centimetres, of a bouncing ball after each bounce can be modelled by the geometric relation\n  h \u202f0  \u2004=\u2004157.4,\u2003  h \u202fn+1  \u2004=\u20040.7  h \u202fn   , where\n \u2022  h \u202f0    is the initial height of the ball, in centimetres\n \u2022  h \u202fn    is the height of the height of the ball, after  n  bounces\nA common ratio of 0.7 indicates that the ball bounces to 70% of its previous height with each bounce.\nThis model can then be used to predict the height of the ball after any number of bounces.See worked example 1\nSee worked example 2\n\t \u20023E\u2002G Eom EtrIc rEcurs Ion appl Ic atIons 157\nThis document is intended for Kayne STANTON at Albert Park College (user ID: 2399298).\nUnauthorised circulation in any form is not permitted.",

  "Page 166": "Modelling financial applications using geometric \nrecurrence relations\nGeometric recurrence relations also have financial applications.\nOne such application is compound interest. Different from simple interest (where interest is \ncalculated once, based on the principal value), compound interest  works from the idea that the \namount of interest is recalculated every set period of time from the most recent value. This period of time is called a compounding period .\nCompound interest can be modelled by the geometric recurrence relation\n  V \u202f0  \u2004=\u2004a,\u2003  V \u202fn+1  \u2004=\u2004R  V \u202fn   , where\n \u2022 a  is the initial value\n \u2022  V \u202fn    is the value after  n  compounding periods\n \u2022 R\u2004=\u20041\u2004+  \u2004  \u202fr\u202f_\u202f100\u202f  , where  r  is the interest rate (%) per compounding period\nFor example, a $1000 investment returns interest at a compounding rate of 4.5% per month. \nThe value of the investment each month could be modelled by the geometric relation\n  V \u202f0  \u2004=\u20041000,\u2003  V \u202fn+1  \u2004=\u20041.045  V \u202fn   \nThe total amount of interest earned on a compound interest investment after  n  months can be \ncalculated using the formula\n I\u2004=\u2004  V \u202fn  \u2004\u2212\u2004 V \u202f0   , where\n \u2022 I  is the total amount of interest earned\n \u2022  V \u202fn    is the value of the investment after  n  months\n \u2022  V \u202f0    is the principal value\nAnother financial application of geometric recurrence relations is reducing balance depreciation, \nwhich differs from flat rate and unit cost depreciation. Instead of an item depreciating in value by a set amount, reducing balance depreciation  reduces the value of an item by a percentage \nof its current value, and is recalculated every set period of time.See worked example 3\nSee worked example 4b.

A common use is linear functions, \nwhere the principles of linear algebra are applied to model different real-life scenarios. Before modelling however, it is important to be able to identify linear functions and their associated graphs, as well as defining features.\nIdentifying linear functions and their graphs\nA linear function  is a relationship between two variables where one value changes by a \nconstant amount in response to the other. Linear functions are generally represented by \nequations expressed in the form\n \ud835\udc66\u2004=\u2004a\u2004+\u2004b \ud835\udc65\u200b , where\n \u2022 a  is the initial value\n \u2022 b  is the constant rate of change\n \u2022 \ud835\udc65\u200b  and  \ud835\udc66  are variables that can change in value\nAn equation is regarded as linear when each variable has a power of either zero or one.

  "Page 201": "Graphing linear functions from an equation\nPlotting functions using a table of values can be time consuming. However, it is also possible \nto graph a linear function by only plotting two points. The two-points method  is a graphing \nmethod that uses any two points to graph a linear function. Two values of  \ud835\udc65  are chosen and \nsubstituted \u200binto\u200bthe\u200blinear\u200bfunction\u200btofind\u200btheir\u200bcorresponding \u200b\u200b\ud835\udc66  values. These points are then \nconnected by a straight line, and extended through the points.\nAlternatively, the two points needed to graph a linear function can be found using either the \ngradient-intercept or intercept-intercept method.\nThe gradient-intercept method  (or slope-intercept method) is a graphing method that involves \nidentifying and plotting the  \ud835\udc66 -intercept, and then using the gradient to plot another point.\nFor a linear function in the gradient-intercept form  \ud835\udc66\u2004=\u2004a\u2004+\u2004b\ud835\udc65  , \n \u2022 a  is the  \ud835\udc66 -intercept, which is the point where the line crosses the  \ud835\udc66 -axis.\n \u2022 b  is the gradient, which represents how steep the line is. The gradient can be thought of as:  \n b\u2004=\u2004\u200b\u202frise\u202f_\u202frun\u202f  .\n  For example, if the gradient is   \u202f1\u202f_\u202f2\u202f    , this means the line moves up by 1 unit for every 2 units it \n\u2018runs\u2019 across to the right. If the gradient is negative, for example \u22122, the line moves down by \n2 units for every 1 unit it \u2018runs\u2019 across to the right (since  \u22122\u2004=\u2004\u200b\u202f\u22122\u202f_\u202f1\u202f  ).See worked example 2b.

This is useful when only two points are known or when it is difficult to read \nspecific values from a graph. If the equation can be found, different values of  \ud835\udc65  and  \ud835\udc66  can be \nsubstituted into the equation to find the corresponding  \ud835\udc65  and  \ud835\udc66  value. This enables any point \nof a linear function to be calculated.\nFinding a linear equation from two known points\nRecall that the general form of a linear function is  \ud835\udc66\u2004=\u2004a\u2004+\u2004b\ud835\udc65  , where\n \u2022 a  is the  \ud835\udc66 -intercept\n \u2022 b  is the gradient\nThe gradient can be calculated using the formula\n b\u2004=\u2004\u200b\u202f \ud835\udc66 \u202f2  \u2004\u2212\u2004 \ud835\udc66 \u202f1  \u202f___________\u202f \ud835\udc65 \u202f2  \u2004\u2212\u2004 \ud835\udc65 \u202f1  \u202f  \nwhere   \ud835\udc65 \u202f1  ,  \ud835\udc65 \u202f2  ,  \ud835\udc66 \u202f1    and   \ud835\udc66 \u202f2    represent two known coordinates    (\u200b\ud835\udc65\u202f1\u200b\u200b,\u202f\u200b\ud835\udc66\u202f1  )   and   (\u200b\ud835\udc65\u202f2\u200b\u200b,\u202f\u200b\ud835\udc66\u202f2  )  .\nWhen provided with two or more coordinates, either in a table or graph, the values of  a  and  b  \ncan be calculated and substituted into the general form for a linear function to determine the \nequation. This method can be simplified when one of the coordinates includes the  \ud835\udc66 -intercept.\nHowever, the equation can still be found when the known values don\u2019t include the  \ud835\udc66 -intercept.\nAn alternative method to find the equation is by using the formula   \ud835\udc66\u2004\u2212\u2004  \ud835\udc66 \u202f1  \u2004=\u2004b  (\ud835\udc65\u2004\u2212\u2004\u200b\ud835\udc65\u202f1  )   .\nAfter calculating the gradient, b, one of the two known points can be substituted into the \nformula to find the equation of the straight line.\nNote: When one value of  a  or  b  is positive and the other is negative, the positive value is often \nplaced first in the equation to make it easier to read.\nFor example,  \ud835\udc66\u2004=\u2004\u221218\u2004+\u20045\ud835\udc65   can instead be written as  \ud835\udc66\u2004=\u20045\ud835\udc65\u2004\u2212\u200418  .See worked example 1\nSee worked example 2\nChap Ter 4: L Inear fun CTIons and graphs\u2002 \t 204\nThis document is intended for Kayne STANTON at Albert Park College (user ID: 2399298).\nUnauthorised circulation in any form is not permitted.",

In a linear model,  a  is the initial value and  b  is the rate of change. Possible rates of \nchange include kilometres per hour, litres per minute and dollars per day. If the rate of change  \nis positive,  b  is positive, and if the rate of change is negative,  b  is negative.\nFor example, if a ski slope initially had 100 cm of snow and 5 cm melts each day, the linear \nequation to describe the situation would be  S\u2004=\u2004100\u2004\u2212\u20045n  , where  S  is the depth (cm) of snow \nafter  n  days.

It can be used in predicting trends, \nsolving simultaneous equations and mapping transformations. Unlike scalar multiplication, \nmatrix multiplication involves two or more matrices.\nDefining matrix products\nA matrix product  is the resulting matrix when two or more matrices are multiplied.  \nHowever, not all matrix multiplications can be performed. \nWhether a matrix product is defined or not is determined by the order of the two (or more) \nmatrices involved. Matrices can only be multiplied together if the number of columns in the  first matrix is equal to the number of rows in the second matrix. \na\ncA =b\nde\nfB =\na\ncAB =b\nde\nf\u00d7a\ncBA =b\nde\nf\u00d7\nOrder: 2 \u00d7 2 2  \u00d7 1 Order: 2 \u00d7 1 2  \u00d7 1\nequal not equal\nThe product  AB  is defined since the number of columns in matrix  A  equals the number of rows \nin matrix  B . The product  BA  is not defined since the number of columns in matrix  B  is not equal \nto the number of rows in matrix  A .\nAs seen in the previous example, the order of multiplication of two matrices is generally not interchangeable, and must be taken into account when determining if a matrix product is defined. One matrix can either pre-multiply or post-multiply another matrix. \nPre-multiplication  is the process of multiplying one matrix before another. For example, the \nproduct  AB  is calculated by pre-multiplying matrix  B  by matrix  A . \nPost-multiplication  is the process of multiplying one matrix after another. For example, the \nproduct  BA  is calculated by post-multiplying matrix  B  by matrix  A .\nIf a matrix product is defined, it will have the same number of rows as the first matrix and the \nsame number of columns as the second matrix. \na\ncAB =b\nde\nf\u00d7\nOrder: 2 \u00d7 2 2 \u00d7 1\n2 \u00d7 1\nThe order of the matrix product  AB  is  2\u2004\u00d7\u20041  .KEY TERMS\n \u2022Matrix product\n \u2022Pre-multiplication\n \u2022Post-multiplication\n \u2022Matrix powerKEY SKILLS\nDuring this lesson, you will be:\n \u2022defining matrix products\n \u2022calculating a matrix product\n \u2022calculating a matrix power.\n\t \u20025C\u2002Adv AnCed oper AtIons w Ith MAtrICes 269\nThis document is intended for Kayne STANTON at Albert Park College (user ID: 2399298).\nUnauthorised circulation in any form is not permitted.",

By using matrix operations and \ninverse matrices, matrix equations can be solved in a similar fashion to regular equations. \nOne application of matrix equations is using them to solve linear simultaneous equations.\nSolving matrix equations\nA matrix equation  is an equation involving matrices. For example,  A\u2004+\u2004X\u2004=\u2004B  is a matrix equation  \ninvolving three separate matrices. Simple equations may involve adding or subtracting matrices, \nor multiplying them by a scalar. Often the equation will have to be rearranged using inverse operations in order to solve for the unknown matrix.\nMore advanced matrix equations may involve the multiplication of matrices. In order to solve \nthese equations, multiplication by inverse matrices is  required.\nIt is important to consider the order of multiplication by inverse matrices, as this is not generally  \ninterchangeable. For example, in th e equation\nAX\u2004=\u2004 B\nX is pre-multiplied by A.

It takes into account a system and manipulates it to find  \nthe change or the lack of change at a given point in time. Along with initial and state matrices, \nmatrix equations can be applied to model the movement from one state to another.\nIdentifying transition matrix properties\nThe unidirectional movement from one state to another is represented by a transition matrix . \nIt follows the understanding that the next state is dependent on the previous state and is \nrepresented by  T .

In such \ncircumstances, it is useful to be able to identify response and explanatory variables, as well as present the data using scatterplots. This enables the data to be further analysed in order to make more definitive statements about the relationship between the variables.\nIdentifying the response and \nexplanatory variables\nInvestigations are performed on bivariate data to examine whether there is an association \nbetween two variables. In these situations, the data is used to determine whether the change in one variable can be explained by the change in another variable. These are called the response and explanatory variables.\nThe response variable\n,  RV , may be explained or predicted by changes in the explanatory \nvariable. It can also be called the dependent variable.The explanatory variable , \n EV , is used to explain or predict the changes observed in the \nresponse variable. It can also be called the independent variable.For example, consider data collected on the \n age  of a group of people from 5-20 years old and \ntheir  height  .\nThe  height   of the group is the response variable, as increases in  heig ht  may be predicted from \nincreases in  age .KEY TERMS\n \u2022Response variable\n \u2022Explanatory variable\n \u2022ScatterplotKEY SKILLS\nDuring this lesson, you will be:\n \u2022identifying the response and explanatory variables\n \u2022constructing scatterplots.\nChap Ter 6: Inves TIgaTIng re LaTIonsh Ips be TWeen TWo numer ICaL v arIabLes\u2002\t 316\nThis document is intended for Kayne STANTON at Albert Park College (user ID: 2399298).\nUnauthorised circulation in any form is not permitted.",

  "Page 335": "Understanding the limitations of correlation \nwith respect to causation\nCorrelation  is a measure of the strength and direction of a relationship between the explanatory \nand response variables. Causation  indicates that a change in the explanatory variable definitively \ncauses the change in the response variable. \nWhile two variables may have a strong correlation, this does not necessarily mean that the \nassociation implies causation. \nA correlation between two variables that have a strong relationship but do not have a causal \nrelationship can occur due to three different circumstances.\nA common response to a third variable may be present in the two variables with the observed \nassociation. For example, there is a positive correlation between  ice cream sales  and  surfboard sales .  \nHowever, it is unlikely that an increase in  ice cream sale s  causes an increase in  surfboar d sale s .  \nA common response to a third variable,  number of t ourists  , is the likely cause of this correlation.\nnumber of tourists\nice cream sales surfboard salespossible causepossible cause\nobserved association\nThere could be confounding variables  that also produce a change in the response variable. \nFor example, there is likely a positive association between the level of  educ ation   and a person\u2019s  \nwage . Although  wage  could be affected by  educ ation  , other related factors such as  intelligence ,  \nparents\u2019 inc ome   and  countr y of r esidenc e  could also have an effect. \nintelligence\neducation wageobserved associationparents\u2019 income\ncountry of residencepossible cause\npossible cause\npossible cause\nLastly, a correlation may exist by pure coincidence . For example, a positive association between  \naverage number of cats owned  and  number of annual lightning strikes  is likely purely coincidental.\nThe presence of correlation in a scatterplot is not evidence of causation unless definitively stated.  \nTherefore, without further exploration, the most informed statement that can be made based on \ncorrelation seen in a scatterplot is that a change in the explanatory variable is associated with either a positive or negative change in the response variable.See worked example 2\nSee worked example 3\nWorked example 2\nIt is observed that the more time a sprinter spends warming up, the worse they perform in a 100-metre race.\na.

It should be drawn approximately through the \nmiddle of the scatterplot, and should follow the direction that the data appears to be moving in.\nA line of good fit with a positive gradient indicates a positive relationship between the variables, \nwhile a line of good fit with a negative gradient indicates a negative relationship.KEY TERMS\n \u2022Line of good fit\n \u2022Interpolation\n \u2022ExtrapolationKEY SKILLS\nDuring this lesson, you will be:\n \u2022constructing a line of good fit by eye\n \u2022using a line of good fit to make predictions.\nChap Ter 6: Inves TIgaTIng rela TIonsh Ips be TWeen TWo nu MerICal var Iables\u2002\t 336\nThis document is intended for Kayne STANTON at Albert Park College (user ID: 2399298).\nUnauthorised circulation in any form is not permitted.",

An interpolation  is a \nprediction that uses the existing data points to make a prediction within the domain of the data set. \nAn extrapolation  is a prediction that uses the existing data points to make a prediction outside the \ndomain of the data set.\nIn the following scatterplot the original data points are shown in blue, while predictions are shown \nin pink. An interpolation is any prediction in which the value of  \ud835\udc65  is between 2 and 12 (inclusive). \nAn extrapolation is any prediction in which the value of  \ud835\udc65  is less than 2 or greater than 12.\n5\n15\n\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\n10\n\u22125\n10\n2\n4\n8\n6\n\u22124\n\u22122Extrapolation Interpolation Extrapolation\nExtrapolation has limited reliability, and should be treated carefully. This is because a line of \ngood fit is estimated using data within the domain. Extending the line of good fit beyond the \ndomain assumes that the general trend will continue beyond what is observed. This assumption cannot be tested, as there is no data with values outside the domain.\nFor example, the following line of good fit is estimated using data on the  age  and  height  of a group \nof students between 12 and 16 years old. When extrapolating the data to age 20, the average height is estimated to be 192 cm. This value is very inaccurate and will only continue to become more inaccurate as age increases. \n220\n120\n11\n12\n17\n170\n10\n20\n180\n200\n190\n210\nheight (cm)\nage (years)\n160\n150\n140\n130\n13\n14\n15\n16\n18\n19\n6C\u2002THEORY\nChap Ter 6: Inves TIgaTIng rela TIonsh Ips be TWeen TWo nu MerICal var Iables\u2002\t 338\nThis document is intended for Kayne STANTON at Albert Park College (user ID: 2399298).\nUnauthorised circulation in any form is not permitted.",

This method can be simplified if one of the known points is the  \ud835\udc66 -intercept.\nRecall that the general form of a linear function is  \ud835\udc66\u2004=\u2004a\u2004+\u2004b\ud835\udc65  , where\n \u2022 a  is the  \ud835\udc66 -intercept\n \u2022 b  is the slope\nThe slope, also known as the gradient, can be calculated using the formula\n b\u2004=\u2004\u200b\u202f\u200b\ud835\udc66\u202f2\u200b\u200b\u2004\u2212\u2004\u200b\ud835\udc66\u200b\u202f1\u200b\u200b\u202f__________\u202f\u200b\ud835\udc65\u202f2\u200b\u200b\u2004\u2212\u2004\u200b\ud835\udc65\u202f1\u200b\u200b\u202f\u200b \nwhere  \u200b\ud835\udc65\u200b\u202f1\u200b\u200b,\u2004\u200b\ud835\udc65\u200b\u202f2\u200b\u200b,\u2004\u200b\ud835\udc66\u200b\u202f1\u200b\u200b  and  \u200b\ud835\udc66\u200b\u202f2\u200b\u200b  represent the \ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc66  values of two known coordinates (  \u200b\ud835\udc65\u200b\u202f1\u200b\u200b,\u2004\u200b\ud835\udc66\u200b\u202f1\u200b\u200b ) and  \n( \u200b\ud835\udc65\u200b\u202f2\u200b\u200b,\u2004\u200b\ud835\udc66\u200b\u202f2\u200b\u200b ) .\nIf the  \ud835\udc66 -intercept can be read off the graph, it will be the value of  a .\nIf not, after calculating the slope,  b , one of the two known points can be substituted into the \nlinear function to find the equation of the straight line.See worked example 1\nSee worked example 2\nWorked example 1\nFind the equation of the line of good fit using the points A and B.\n \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66 \n0123456\n0 2 4 6 8\n\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65AB\nContinues \u2192\nChap Ter 6: Inves TIgaTIng rela TIOnsh Ips be Tween TwO numer ICal var Iables\u2002\t 348\nThis document is intended for Kayne STANTON at Albert Park College (user ID: 2399298).\nUnauthorised circulation in any form is not permitted.",

They are \nuseful for summarising connections or pathways between different vertices, and can be constructed from both directed and undirected networks. Communication matrices are a unique application of adjacency matrices.\nConstructing adjacency matrices and graphs\nAn adjacency matrix  represents the number of direct connections between vertices in a graph. \nIt is a square matrix that has a row and column for each vertex. Each element represents the \nnumber of edges connecting two vertices.\nFor example, the following graph can be used to construct the accompanying adjacency matrix.Note: A loop counts as one edge.\nD\nC\nB\nE\nA\n0\n2\n1\n00A\nBC\nDE2\n00\n00B A\n1\n00\n110\n01\n000\n01\n01C D E\nThe \u20182\u2019 in row 1, column 2, indicates that there are two edges connecting vertices A and B. This is \nalso shown in row 2, column 1.\nThe \u20181\u2019 in row 5, column 5, indicates that there is a loop at vertex E.The \u20180\u2019 in row 2, column 4, indicates that there are no edges connecting vertices B and D.The columns and rows of the adjacency matrix should add up to the degree of that vertex. \nHowever, if a loop is involved, the columns and rows will add up to one less than the degree of the vertex for each loop involved, as a loop is counted as two degrees but only one edge.See worked example 1\nChApTer 7: Gr Aphs And ne Tworks\u2002 \t 374\nThis document is intended for Kayne STANTON at Albert Park College (user ID: 2399298).\nUnauthorised circulation in any form is not permitted.",

Trees are an important feature of networks that allow people to define \nnetwork problems mathematically, whether minimising the amount of NBN cabling required to service a city and its surrounding suburbs, or deciding the optimal way to connect the passageways of the state library. These trees allow for the use of greedy algorithms that help  solve these real world problems efficiently.\nIdentifying trees in a network\nA tree is a simple connected graph that contains no loops, circuits or duplicate edges.

A minimum spanning tree is the spanning tree of a weighted graph that has the lowest possible total weight.\nNote: Some weighted graphs have more than one minimum spanning tree.Although it is possible to identify a minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph by eye, a greedy \nalgorithm can be applied to reduce the effort required. A greedy algorithm is any procedure \nin which the optimal (best) solution is found for every step of a multi-step problem. Two such greedy algorithms are Prim\u2019s algorithm  and Kruskal\u2019s algorithm , both of which help to \nidentify the minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph.\nPrim\u2019s algorithm contains the following steps:\n1. Locate and draw any vertex from the weighted graph.\n2. Look at the edges that connect to this vertex and choose the edge with the lowest weight. \nIf there are two edges of the same weight, pick either. Draw the edge and the new vertex it connects to.\n3. Look at the edges that connect to either of the vertices and choose the one with the lowest weight that connects to a new vertex. Draw this edge and the new vertex it connects to.\n4. Repeat this process until all vertices are connected.\nKruskal\u2019s algorithm contains the following steps:\n1. Identify the edge with the smallest weight. Draw it and the two vertices it connects to.\n2. Identify the edge with the next smallest weight. If it does not create a loop, cycle, or multiple edge with the spanning tree so far, draw it and the vertices it connects to (if not already drawn).\n3.

These are examples of the relationship between two or more variables.\nClassifying variation as direct or inverse\nVariation  is the change in one variable as a result of the change in another variable.\nIf two variables vary with each other, they are said to be proportional. The degree of \nproportionality is defined by  k , the constant of proportionality . There are two distinct  \ntypes of variation, direct and inverse.\nDirect variation  is when an increase in one variable results in a scalar change in the \nother variable.\nThe graph of direct variation between  \ud835\udc65   and  \ud835\udc66   is a straight line with the equation \n \ud835\udc66\u2004=\u2004k\ud835\udc65  \nA graph of direct variation is no different to other linear equations.

However, there are also instances where values \nhave a large number of digits. For example, the Avogadro constant, the approximate number of nucleons in one gram of ordinary matter, has over 20 decimal places, making it difficult to write simply. As a result, there are processes, such as rounding or using scientific notation, to condense the number into a form that is easier to read and perform calculations with.\nApproximating values using rounding\nRounding is the process of condensing a number so that it is more convenient to write and use \nin calculations. This can include rounding to a whole number, a specified number of decimal places, or the nearest 5, 10 or 100 (or some other place value). The drawback of rounding is a loss of accuracy.\nWhen rounding, the following rules are applied:\n \u2022The digit directly following the required rounded digits is used to determine rounding.\n \u2022If this digit is between 0 and 4, the number is rounded down.\n \u2022If this digit is between 5 and 9, the number is rounded up.\nAnother way of rounding is to a certain number of significant figures. A significant figure is a \ndigit in a number that contributes to the value of the number with certainty. \nThere are several ways to identify if a digit is a significant figure.\n \u2022From left to right, the first significant figure is always the first non-zero digit.\n \u2022All non-zero digits are significant.\n \u2022All zeros in between significant figures are significant.\n \u2022In a number with a decimal point, all zeros after any non-zero digit are significant.\n \u2022All other zeros are not significant.See worked example 1\nSee worked example 2KEY TERMS\n \u2022Rounding\n \u2022Significant figure\n \u2022Scientific notation\n \u2022Order of magnitudeKEY SKILLS\nDuring this lesson, you will be:\n \u2022approximating values using rounding\n \u2022expressing values using scientific notation.\nCHApter 9: Me Asure Ment\u2002\t 486\nThis document is intended for Kayne STANTON at Albert Park College (user ID: 2399298).\nUnauthorised circulation in any form is not permitted.",

Sometimes the volume of an object must \nbe measured accurately to ensure that requirements are met, such as the volume of cargo transported from one place to another using a delivery truck.\nCalculating the volume of prisms and cylinders\nRecall that volume is the amount of three-dimensional space taken up by an object. It is measured \nin cubic units of length, commonly cubic centimetres (cm3) or cubic metres (m3), and is calculated \ndifferently depending on the object that is being considered.\nOne such set of objects are called prisms. A prism  is a three-dimensional object that has the same  \ncross-section across its entire length. In other words, if the front face of a prism is a triangle,  \nthe back face of the prism will be the exact same triangle, connected by straight lines.\nA cylinder is similar in principle to a prism, but with a curved side. Its front and back face are \ncircles connected by straight lines.\nIn all instances, the volume of a prism or cylinder can be calculated by first calculating the area \nof the cross-section and then multiplying by the length of the prism.\nSome common formulas are given in the following table.\nsolid example area of cross-section volume\ncube\nbb\nb A\u2004=\u2004  b  \u202f2   V\u2004=\u2004  b  \u202f3  \nrectangular prism\nbhl A\u2004=\u2004bh   V\u2004=\u2004bhl  \nContinues \u2192KEY TERMS\n \u2022Prism\n \u2022Cylinder\n \u2022Tapered solid\n \u2022Cone\n \u2022Sphere\n \u2022Hemisphere\n \u2022Composite solidKEY SKILLS\nDuring this lesson, you will be:\n \u2022calculating the volume of prisms and cylinders\n \u2022calculating the volume of tapered solids\n \u2022calculating the volume of spheres\n \u2022calculating the volume of composite solids.\nChapter 9: Mea Sure Ment\u2002\t 544\nThis document is intended for Kayne STANTON at Albert Park College (user ID: 2399298).\nUnauthorised circulation in any form is not permitted.",

From organising the flight paths of multiple \nplanes, to plotting a course by sea, to planning a trip across the country, bearings are the \nglobal tool for communicating location and navigation.\nIdentifying and drawing true bearings\nAlthough there are different ways to define bearings, the most universal method is using true \nbearings. A true bearing  measures the position of one object relative to another, with reference \nto north. A true bearing is measured clockwise from north and is always written using three digits, even if the first digit is a zero. For example, a true bearing of 37\u00b0 will be written as 037\u00b0. A true bearing is sometimes referred to as a three-figur e bearing .\nWhen determining the true bearing of an object, it is important to identify a starting point  \n(\u2018from\u2019 is frequently used to denote this) and an ending point (\u2018to\u2019 is frequently used to denote this).  \nFor example, \u2018the true bearing from the ship to the lighthouse\u2019.\nIf the true bearing in the opposite direction is required (\u2018the true bearing from the lighthouse to \nthe ship\u2019), an addition or subtraction of 180\u00b0 is required. It is important when completing this calculation that the value remains between 0\u00b0 and 360\u00b0.\nSometimes the angle provided in a problem is not the bearing, but can be used to calculate it.  \nIn cases like this, it is important to remember that a full revolution is 360\u00b0.\nIt is also important to know how to draw bearings using bearing diagrams. These help to visualise  \napplied problems, which is often necessary to find a solution. On bearing diagrams, the direction \nof north is shown as a ray (arrow) and labelled \u2018N\u2019 or \u2018north\u2019.See worked example 1\nSee worked example 2\nSee worked example 3KEY TERMS\n \u2022True bearing\n \u2022Three-figure bearingKEY SKILLS\nDuring this lesson, you will be:\n \u2022identifying and drawing true bearings\n \u2022solving problems using true bearings.\nWorked example 1\nA ship has sailed past a lighthouse as shown in the following diagram.\nN\n56\u00b0\nContinues \u2192\n\t \u200210E\u2002B Earings 615\nThis document is intended for Kayne STANTON at Albert Park College (user ID: 2399298).\nUnauthorised circulation in any form is not permitted.",

Explanation\nStep 1:  Determine whether the variables are counted/measured \nor categorised into groups.\n The variable  age  (under 55 years, 55 years and over) is \ncategorised, and the variable  preferr ed tr avel destination   \n(domestic, international) is also categorised.\nStep 2:  Classify each variable as categorical or numerical.\n The variable  age  (under 55 years, 55 years and over) is \ncategorical.\n The variable  preferr ed tr avel destination   (domestic, \ninternational) is also categorical.\nAnswer\nA\n21% of students chose option C, presumably because  \nage  appears to be numerical as it is based on numbers. \nThis answer is incorrect however, because the question \nspecifies that  age  is broken into two categories (under 55 \nyears, 55 years and over), making it a categorical variable.14. Explanation\nStep 1:  Classify each variable as categorical or numerical.\n The variable  frequenc y of nightmar es  (low, high) is \ncategorical as it specifies two categories, low and high.\n The variable  snor es  (no, yes) is categorical as it specifies \ntwo categories, no and yes.\nStep 2:  Identify whether there is a logical order for the categories \nof each variable.\n Even though there are only two categories,  frequenc y \nof nightmar es  (low, high) does have a logical order. The \nascending order of frequency would be low, high, and the descending order of frequency would be high, low.\n The variable  snor es  (no, yes) does not have an implicit \nascending or descending order.\nStep 3:  Classify the variables as nominal or ordinal.\n The variable  frequency of nightmares  (low, high) is ordinal.\n The variable  snor es  (no, yes) is nominal.\nAnswer\nA\n24% of students chose option D due to the misconception \nthat the variable  snor es  (no, yes) is ordinal.\nQuestions from multiple lessons\n15.

Explanation\nStep 1:  Use the parallel boxplots to identify the median  maximum \ndaily temperature   and  minimum daily temperature  .\n The median  maximum daily temperature   is 25 \u00b0C.\n The median  minimum daily temperature   is 15 \u00b0C.\nStep 2:  Calculate the difference.\n  25\u2004\u2212\u200415\u2004=\u200410  \nAnswer\nFor November 2017, the median value for maximum daily \ntemperature was 10 \u00b0C higher than the median value for  \nminimum daily temperature.\n17. Explanation\nTo solve this question, check whether each option is true or false.\nA: This is false. Boxplots show the distribution of several data points. \nNot all the babies in country B have the same height. \u2716\nB: This is true. The median height of the babies in country B is \ngreater than the maximum height of the babies in country A. \u2714\nC: This is false. The minimum height of the babies in country A is less than the minimum height in country B, so 50% of the babies born in country B cannot be shorter than all the babies in country A. \u2716\nD: This is false.   Q \u202f3    for the babies in country A is greater than the \nminimum height of the babies in country B. \u2716\nE: This is false.   Q \u202f1    for the babies in country B is less than the \nmaximum height of the babies in country A. \u2716\nAnswer\nB\nMany students incorrectly chose option E. Students may not have  \nrecognised that in order for 75% of the babies in country B to be \ntaller than all of the babies in country A, the line representing the first quartile needed to be greater than the maximum value in country A.

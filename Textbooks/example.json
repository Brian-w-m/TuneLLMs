Michael cannot list a three-year loan as current \nbecause that implies that this liability and all others will have to be paid \nwithin 12 months. This is not the case as the business should be able to \ndistinguish between those liabilities that are current (to be paid within 12 \nmonths) and those that are non-current (do not have to be paid for a \nperiod greater than 12 months).\nSimmons, Hardy 2 \u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2019",

The receipt of \ncash is just the other half of the credit sale transaction. When the cash \nflows into the business it is a transfer of assets from Accounts Receivable\nto bank and has no resulting impact on owner\u2019s equity. The revenue has \nalready been recorded in the Sales Journal. To record it again would \ndouble count the revenue.\nd\nReason 1 Credit sales were greater than receipts from Accounts Receivable \u2013 this \ncaused Net Profit to increase more than Cash at bank .\nReason 2 Loan repayment is a cash payment and not an expense. Therefore, it will \ndecrease Cash at bank but will have no effect on Net Profit.\ne\nDiscussion Despite the initial financial considerations of the potential for improved \nGross and Net Profit via cheaper inventory, the potential for bad press \nand the fact that we could be left with inventory we cannot sell would \nquickly outweigh this potential. We would not want to lose potential sales \nand customers from bad will of stocking toxic paint.\nOn an ethical basis Smith\u2019s Hardware would want to ensure its products \nmeet safety standards and that it would not want to sell a product that \ncontains lead that has been proven to cause serious health concerns.\nThey should remain with their current supplier and discuss better pricing \nwith them or otherwise keep investigating to find another supplier who is \ncompliant.\nSimmons, Hardy 7 \u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2019",
